{"article": "Sheikh Nawwaf al-Melhem, a leader of the officially-tolerated opposition People's Party, told the BBC he had brokered an agreement between the state and inmates at Hama Central Prison. The prison's power and water supplies had now been restored, he said. Interior Minister Mohammed Shaar said the situation at the prison was normal and denied there had been any disorder. Human rights and opposition activists say the prisoners took guards hostage about a week ago as they tried to halt the transfer of several inmates to another facility where they believed they might be executed. Security forces reportedly surrounded the jail and twice failed to retake it by force. Sheikh Nawwaf, who is also a prominent tribal leader in central Syria, said he travelled to Hama Prison on Saturday afternoon. The inmates' demands focused on ensuring fair and speedy trials for those detained without trial, and the release of those held without charge, he added. Sheikh Nawwaf said he had presented the demands to Mr Shaar and Justice Minister Najm Hamad al-Ahmed in Hama on Sunday. He said a deal to end the mutiny was reached later that day and included a promise from the government of fair trials for political detainees. Leading rights activist Mazen Darwish, who is in touch with the prisoners, confirmed that a verbal agreement had been reached, but did not give any details. Another activist told Reuters news agency the government had \"agreed to most of our demands to release those political detainees held without charge\". The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based group that monitors the conflict in Syria, reported that 26 detainees would be released soon. Later on Monday, the official Sana news agency reported that Mr Shaar and Mr Ahmed had visited the prison, and that they promised to \"provide inmates' needs\" and ensure that none were mistreated. But it also cited a statement by the interior minister as saying that the situation there was \"normal, contrary to the lies and fabrications spread by malicious media outlets as part of their anti-Syria propaganda\". The reported deal came after conditions worsened inside the prison, with authorities cutting electricity and water supplies, and inmates reporting a food shortage and serious medical cases. Security forces also tried to storm the cell block where the prisoners were holding out on Friday and Saturday, using tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition. The BBC was told that 15 prisoners were shot and wounded. The revolt was sparked by a move to transfer several detainees to the notorious Sednaya Prison near Damascus. \"You can't imagine, even in your worst nightmare, what kind of torture [takes place] in Sednaya,\" a lawyer who is in contact with the prisoners told the BBC.

The European Commission said the plans, which would also remove banners for non-intrusive cookies, would help to tackle an \"overload\" of such requests. But experts warned the plans could harm advert-funded media, as well as platforms such as Facebook and Google. Cookies are small files that download on to a user's device and enable tracking, sometimes to power advertising. Since 2012, EU rules have required websites to tell users what cookies are being placed on their machine. Typically, this meant a pop-up window seeking consent. European Commission vice-president, Andrus Ansip, said it was now proposing simpler rules, \"so that internet users do not have to click on a banner every time they visit a website\". \"This way, people will be more in control of their settings,\" he said. Under the plans, websites could read the cookie preferences set in users' browsers. Also, banners would be scrapped for cookies that do not invade users' privacy, such as those remembering shopping cart history or counting website hits. Last year, many internet companies called for the EU to scrap the so-called \"cookie law\", introduced in 2012. However, the latest proposals could end up damaging online services and frustrate web users, according to a senior executive at a trade body that represents many of the world's biggest internet firms. \"The banners are certainly annoying. The question is whether they come up with something that's better or worse,\" said James Waterworth, vice-president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association. He warned the proposals could harm a range of companies, from Facebook through to newspapers, if many users opted against allowing all but the least intrusive cookies. \"If this is done wrong and it's much harder to obtain permission, then it could have a serious impact on ad-funded services,\" he told the BBC. Under the proposals, users could set a preference in their browser for the level of cookies to which they consent.

{"article": "The report for 2015 is due out in the next few weeks, so the most recent report we have is the 2014 one. In the year covered by that report, 1,013 tests were conducted for IPC sports (which include athletics, swimming, powerlifting and skiing) in which prohibited substances were found nine times. During the year, sanctions were taken against 11 athletes. If you break that down into the sports involved it is clear that most of the IPC's anti-doping problems come from the sport of powerlifting, which was the source of seven of the positive tests and eight of the sanctions. The IPC announced in 2014 that it had suspended 13 powerlifters in the previous 14 months. The sport has been targeted with a \"Raise the Bar - Say No! to Doping\" campaign. Since then, the IPC has also adopted a new anti-doping code, which came into effect on 1 January 2015. Paralympic athletes have the same list of banned substances as Olympic athletes and, like them, anyone who requires additional medication for pain or treatment must apply for an exemption. \"It's a common misconception that a lot of Paralympians will be on prescription drugs. That's not the case at all,\" Nicole Sapstead, UK Anti-Doping chief executive, told the BBC ahead of London 2012. \"Obviously there are athletes with spinal injuries and they need pain relief. But mostly it is the same as the Olympics - things like asthma and diabetes.\" Only one athlete was given a doping sanction at the Sochi Paralympic Winter Games in 2014, but since then the McLaren Report for the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found that Russia's sports ministry manipulated urine samples provided by its athletes between 2011 and 2015. The report identified 27 samples relating to eight Para-sports, five of which are summer sports, including some governed by the IPC. The IPC also found evidence that samples were swapped during the Sochi Winter Paralympics, adding that it planned to reanalyse every Russian sample given at the event. So now the Russian team has been banned from this year's Paralympic Games in Rio, and the IPC is wondering if it has more of a doping problem than it previously thought.", "abstract": "The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) gives details of anti-doping activities in its annual reports.", "candidate": "Every four years the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) releases its annual anti-doping report.", "doc_id": 3660, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "Every year the IPC releases its annual anti-doping report.", "evidence": "The report for 2015 is due out in the next few weeks, so the most recent report we have is the 2014 one.", "explanation": "it makes up the full name of the IPC, and that there's 4 years between reports", "instruction": "Remove the information about the full name of the IPC from the summary.

{"article": "It is the last day of the Indian prime minister's tour of China and he is meeting some of the heads of Chinese industry. He will be hoping that they will be able to drive forward his signature policy, 'Make in India'. But one year into his term as prime minister and many say Mr Modi is showing some distinctly undemocratic tendencies as he tries to foster a manufacturing boom in India. At the end of April, India cancelled the registration of nearly 9,000 foreign-funded non-governmental organisations (NGOs), saying they didn't comply with the country's tax codes. And the Indian government has singled out the environmental pressure group, Greenpeace, for special attention. The reason why says a lot, both about Mr Modi's ambitions for India and his attitude to dissent. This week Greenpeace won a small victory. On Wednesday the government lifted its ban on activist Priya Pillai travelling abroad. In January she was stopped from travelling to the UK to testify to British MPs about the effects of coal mining in India. But the war is far from over. The charity says it will have to close down in a matter of weeks unless the Indian government lifts the financial freeze it has imposed on the NGO. A secret report from India's Intelligence Bureau, leaked last year, explains why India's government has such a beef with the environmental charity. It said campaigns headed by Greenpeace and other NGOs had drained three percentage points off the nation's annual growth rate. Greenpeace wouldn't claim to have been anywhere near that influential but its campaign against the coal industry does strike at the heart of the 'Make in India' policy. Coal is the main source of power in India and is central to the BJP government's plans to boost industrial production. It is also the most polluting of all fossil fuels and a key driver of climate change. And, when it comes to coal, India compares poorly even with China, as Mr Modi's visit highlights. China's coal use of coal has been falling steeply, helping stall world growth in CO2 emissions. Meanwhile India's CO2 emissions are forecast to rise rapidly. According to the International Energy Agency, India is set to double its coal consumption by 2035 and become the world's largest coal importer by around 2020. Almost half of the 1,200 new coal-fired power stations proposed around the world are in India according to the World Resources Institute. That's why campaigning against the coal industry in India has been a priority for Greenpeace. The charity's campaigns have stopped coal mining in some of India's forest areas. The NGO will also have earned the government's ire by its relentless attack on two of India's corporate behemoths, Coal India and the Adani Group. Coal India is the biggest coal company in the world and India's fifth largest company. The Adani Group is the third biggest coal company in world and its head, Gautam Adani, is known to be close to the Indian prime minister. But the Indian government's attempt to muzzle Greenpeace and other NGOs has generated a chorus of criticism. India likes to celebrate its status as the world's largest democracy but the American ambassador to India has said its harassment of NGOs had a \"chilling effect\" on the nation's democracy. When the Indian electorate voted Mr Modi into power with a handsome majority a year ago they were voting for his promise to transform the Indian economy. Mr Modi is clearly determined to deliver on that promise. Indeed some Indians now fear that he may compromise some of the country's other core values along the way.", "abstract": "Narendra Modi is probably celebrating the first anniversary of his landslide victory with a Chinese meal.", "candidate": "Narendra Modi is sitting down with a group of Chinese business leaders in Beijing's Great Hall of the People.", "doc_id": 3647, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Prime Minister Modi is sitting down with a group of Chinese business leaders as part of his Chinese tour.", "evidence": "It is the last day of the Indian prime minister's tour of China and he is meeting some of the heads of Chinese industry.", "explanation": "The summary mentions Prime Minister Modi's first name is Narendra, which is true, but the source text doesn't mention the Prime Minister's first name.

Shares in the US rose, with both the Dow Jones and S&P 500 index up by 0.6% in morning trading. The past few days have seen huge swings on the world's financial markets as traders and investors struggled to assess the impact of the UK's vote to leave the European Union. After two days of heavy falls following the vote, shares spent two days recovering, and on Wednesday, the FTSE 100 ended above the level it had closed at last Thursday. However, the FTSE 250 index - which contains more UK-focused companies - still remains well below its pre-referendum level. \"The blue chip [FTSE 100] index is stuffed full with big international firms and it is these companies propelling the rise. The heavy weighting towards these groups is very misleading,\" said Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital. \"The likes of Fresnillo, Randgold, AstraZeneca, Royal Dutch Shell, British American Tobacco - these are hardly dependent on, or reflective of, the UK economy. They're listed in London but their earnings come from abroad. \"There is a key distinction. UK-focused firms are doing much, much worse.

A third man, former Rangers co-administrator David Whitehouse, was earlier arrested in England. All three men are expected to appear at Glasgow Sherriff Court on Wednesday.

{"article": "Sales volumes were 1.3% higher in the month compared with March. They were also 4.3% higher than a year earlier, the Office For National Statistics (ONS) said. The ONS revised March's retail sales figures, showing retail sales fell by just 0.5% rather than 1.3%, as first estimated. \"Clothing stores remain the main drag on growth in the retail sector, with sales hampered by unseasonal weather. However... sales increased in April compared with March as lower prices boosted sales,\" said ONS statistician Melanie Richard. Colder than usual weather had also dented spending in March, hurting demand for spring and summer clothes, according to the ONS and surveys from the British Retail Consortium and the CBI. The latest ONS figures showed total average store prices in April were 2.8% lower than a year earlier, dragged down by a 7.3% drop in fuel prices. Food store prices fell 2.3% amid the continuing supermarket price war. However, the total amount spent in April increased by 2.1% to \u00c2\u00a328.1bn compared with the year before. Keith Richardson, of Lloyds Bank commercial banking, said a rush to complete property deals before a stamp duty rise came into effect in April had helped to boost demand for household goods and furniture. Vicky Redwood, chief economist at Capital Economics, said that consumer confidence did not seem to have been adversely affected by the UK's upcoming referendum on EU membership. \"Indeed, consumer spending should prevent the economy from slowing too much this quarter, even if referendum uncertainty has a bigger impact on business confidence and investment,\" she said. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said the rise in April's retail sales was welcome, but highlighted imbalances in the UK economy. \"After the disappointing decline in March, the strong retail sales recovery in April supports our view that in spite of major headwinds the UK economy continues to grow, albeit at a slowing pace,\" said David Kern, BCC chief economist. \"However, the contrast between buoyant retail sales and the problems facing other sectors such as manufacturing highlights the unbalanced nature of Britain's recovery.\" The BCC called for \"a more balanced economic structure with a stronger focus on exports, investment and manufacturing\".

{"article": "Vern Cotter names his squad for the Championship on Tuesday, three months after a 35-34 quarter-final defeat. Referee Craig Joubert awarded the Wallabies a late penalty that replays suggested was an incorrect decision. \"You feel you're over it and then you see something and it brings it all back,\" Hogg told BBC Scotland. \"I was watching something on the TV a couple of weeks ago about the legacy of the World Cup and when us going out came up, it just brought back horrible memories. It was bitterly disappointing.\" Hogg is set to be included in a squad missing the injured Harlequins wing Tim Visser - ruled out of at least the first two games - and flanker Alasdair Strokosch, who retired from Test rugby after the World Cup. Another injury concern is Glasgow centre Mark Bennett, who was due to see a specialist on Monday to determine whether he needs an operation on his injured shoulder. The involvement of Warriors pair Ryan Wilson and Tim Swinson could hinge on the outcome of disciplinary proceedings against them following the European Champions Cup loss at Northampton. But club-mate and fellow midfielder Alex Dunbar could return to the Scotland fold after missing the World Cup with the after-effects of a knee injury sustained in training during last year's Six Nations. After the Calcutta Cup opener against England at Murrayfield on 6 February, Scotland travel to Cardiff - one of three away fixtures in this year's campaign - to face Wales in their second match a week later. Hogg says the squad will be desperate to banish the memories of not only their World Cup despair, but the embarrassment of a Six Nations whitewash last year. \"It is another challenge for us now, but we can take immense confidence from the World Cup,\" said the 23-year-old, who has only tasted victory in three of his 19 Six Nations matches since his 2012 debut. \"If I'm fortunate enough to be picked, hopefully we can produce something special in this Six Nations. England first up at Murrayfield is exactly what you want and it would be great to be part of that. \"Getting a good couple of wins early doors would give us immense confidence going forward, and we'd be in the tournament if that happens. \"We have let ourselves down in the last couple of Six Nations but we are looking forward to it.\" Hogg and his Glasgow team-mates will be hoping that joining up with Scotland provides a catalyst for rediscovering their World Cup form. Four successive defeats since Christmas have seen them slip to eighth in the Pro 12 table and effectively exit the European Champions Cup, after a third pool defeat on Sunday to Northampton. \"Our target was to become the number one team in Europe and we've fallen short again,\" Hogg noted. \"It's fine and well having good performances here and there but it's wins that we need. Europe is the be-all and end-all of club rugby so we're bitterly disappointed to no longer be part of it.\" After their final Champions Cup game against pool leaders Racing 92 at Kilmarnock's Rugby Park on Saturday, Glasgow - eight points off the Pro 12 play-off positions, but with two games in hand - must turn their attention to restoring last season's lustre. \"We're defending champions although to be honest we have not been playing like it lately,\" Hogg added. \"For us it's a challenge to get back up to where we belong.\"", "abstract": "Scotland full-back Stuart Hogg says memories of their controversial World Cup exit to Australia are still raw as they prepare for the Six Nations.", "candidate": "Scotland full-back Stuart Hogg says the \"horrible memories\" of last year's World Cup defeat by Australia have returned ahead of the Six Nations.", "doc_id": 1602, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Scotlander Stuart Hogg says the \"horrible memories\" of last year's World Cup defeat by Australia have returned ahead of the Six Nations.", "evidence": "Hogg told BBC Scotland \"I was watching something on the TV a couple of weeks ago about the legacy of the World Cup and when us going out came up, it just brought back horrible memories.", "explanation": "summary adds info about Hogg being a full-back; this fact is not found in the source text", "instruction": "Remove the information about full-back from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about full-back from the summary."]}}

One of his sons, Dale Brickwood, said the family was becoming \"increasingly frustrated\" the killers had not yet been brought to justice. Police said the case was \"a priority\" they were \"committed\" to solving. Mr Brickwood was attacked when several men broke into his Lindsay Avenue home in the early hours of the morning. He was left with multiple stab wounds to the head, leg and hand. The scrap metal dealer was known to keep money in his house. His son Dale said the family was not sure how much was taken but during a Crimewatch reconstruction on 8 February police appealed for \"anyone [who has] come into contact with a large amount of old style \u00a320 and \u00a350 notes\" to come forward. His son said watches and jewellery were also taken. The offenders would have been \"covered in blood\", officers said, but despite that, no-one has been charged. Two men arrested shortly after the murder were released with no further action. Three other men remain on bail. Mr Brickwood criticised Northamptonshire Police for a lack of communication, saying: \"We seem to be finding information and giving it to them.\" The police \"don't really talk to us\", he added. Northamptonshire Police said two family liaison officers had been assigned plus a \"dedicated team of detectives\".

{"article": "Security organisations had previously identified Iran as one of at least eight countries targeted by the code. The spyware is believed to have been designed to steal data to help launch further cyber attacks. The sender has not been identified, but researchers have found a reference to a US television programme in Duqu's code. The Iranian news agency, IRNA, reported that the country's cyber defence unit was taking steps to combat the infection. \"The software to control the virus has been developed and made available to organisations and corporations,\" Brigadier General Gholamreza Jalali, head of Iran's civil defence body, is quoted as saying. \"All the organisations and centres that could be susceptible to being contaminated are being controlled.\" Mr Jalali said a \"final report\" into which organisations had been targeted was still being worked on. Last year the Iranian government accused the West of trying to disrupt its nuclear facilities using the Stuxnet worm computer attack. Then in April 2011 officials said the country's facilities had been targeted by a second piece of malware dubbed \"Stars\". Officials now describe the Duqu attack as the \"third virus\" to hit Iran. The computer security specialist Kaspersky Lab said it believed that \"Stars\" was a keylogging program that may have been part of the same attack that installed Duqu. Keylogging programs are able to collect information about a computer system, take screenshots, search for files and capture passwords. The firm also provided more detail about how Duqu worked based on its analysis of other targets. It said another unidentified company received an email from an individual identifying himself as Mr B Jason who requested a joint business venture. The firm believed this was a reference to the Jason Bourne books and spy movies. The recipient was asked to open a Microsoft Word attachment that referenced the targeted company's name in its title, and thus did not appear to be spam. It said that for every victim a separate set of attack files was created using a different control server. The firm said this happened at least 12 times. When the addressee opened the file the malware became active through a Truetype font exploit, but did nothing until it detected that there had been no keyboard or mouse activity for ten minutes. Kaspersky Lab said the font was called Dexter Regular and its creators were identified as Showtime Inc. \"This is another prank pulled by the Duqu authors, since Showtime Inc is the cable broadcasting company behind the TV series Dexter, about a CSI doctor who happens also to be a serial killer,\" the report said. The firm said the exploit then loaded a driver onto the system. Analysis of the driver suggested it was compiled as long ago as August 2007. \"If this information is correct, then the authors of Duqu must have been working on this project for over four years,\" the report said. The firm said the driver then began a process that led to the Duqu trojan being installed allowing the attackers to introduce new modules, infect other networked computers, and collect information. The company said efforts to identify the attackers have been complicated by the fact that the suspects appear to have deactivated several of the control servers thought to have been involved in the attacks.", "abstract": "Iran has confirmed some of its computer systems were infected with the Duqu trojan, but said it has found a way to control the malware.", "candidate": "Iranian officials have confirmed that the country has been hit by malware known as Duqu.", "doc_id": 1732, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "Officials now describe the Duqu attack as the \"third virus\" to hit Iran.", "explanation": "the summary is correct since the info it provides about the malware attack is supported by the source text.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

The world number one now plays Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska, who beat Petra Kvitova 6-2 7-6 and will reclaim the world number two ranking when the new list is released on Monday. \"She knows how to play in big stadiums and big matches, big games,\" Williams said of Halep.

The 6ft 6in German, the younger brother of tour player Mischa Zverev, led 5-3 and 40-30 in the final set, only to make three straight unforced errors. Nadal, 29, battled back impressively, but had glowing praise for the teenager, who is set to rise to a career-high ranking of 52 next week. \"He is amazingly talented,\" said Nadal. \"He is probably going to be the number one in the world. \"With his second serve at 120mph, with a lot of spin and at 124, 123, 120mph, it was impossible.

{"article": "The two firms should be barred from any US mergers and acquisitions, according to a House Intelligence Committee report. The panel says the firms failed to allay fears about their association with China's government and military. Huawei and ZTE denied the accusations in front of the panel in September. On Monday ZTE issued a statement insisting its equipment met all US standards and posed no threat. \"ZTE has set an unprecedented standard for co-operation by any Chinese company with a congressional investigation,\" China's Xinhua news agency quoted the firm as saying. How China became the US election bogeyman . Huawei's vice-president, William Plummer, said the latest accusations were \"dangerous political distractions\". \"Purporting that Huawei is somehow uniquely vulnerable to cyber mischief ignores technical and commercial realities, recklessly threatens American jobs and innovation, does nothing to protect national security.\" While the House Intelligence report stopped short of calling for a boycott of the firms' mobile phone products, it was highly critical of the two companies. \"China has the means, opportunity and motive to use telecommunications companies for malicious purposes,\" the report says. \"Based on available classified and unclassified information, Huawei and ZTE cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus pose a security threat to the United States and to our systems.\" The panel said their investigation had received credible allegations from current and former Huawei employees of bribery and corruption, discriminatory behaviour and copyright infringement. Republican committee chairman Mike Rogers said they had passed on information to the FBI to investigate the allegations. \"We've come to the conclusion, unfortunately, they are not private entities,\" Mr Rogers said on Monday. On Sunday, Mr Rogers delivered a blunt verdict to the 60 Minutes programme on US network CBS. \"If I were an American company today... and you are looking at Huawei, I would find another vendor if you care about your intellectual property, if you care about your consumers' privacy, and you care about the national security of the United States of America,\" he said. Among the report's recommendations were to exclude any Huawei or ZTE equipment or component parts from being used by government contractors, as well both companies becoming \"more transparent and responsive to US legal obligations\". China's Foreign Ministry urged the US to \"set aside prejudices\" regarding the two firms. \"Chinese telecoms companies have been developing their international business based on market economy principles,\" ministry spokesman Hong Lei said. \"Their investment in the United States embodies the mutually beneficial nature of Sino-American economic and trade relations.\" Huawei was started by Ren Zhengfei, a former member of the People's Liberation Army, in 1987. As the firm has grown to become one of the largest global players in the sector, fears about its ties with the Chinese military have frequently surfaced. There have been concerns and allegations that it was helping China gather information on foreign states and companies, charges that the firm has denied. Last year, its purchase of American computer company 3Leaf systems, was rejected by a US security panel. Earlier this year, it along with ZTE, faced allegations that some of their equipment had been installed with codes to relay sensitive information back to China. Senior executives from the two companies denied those allegations when they appeared before US lawmakers in September. ZTE is also facing accusations it sold US telecoms equipment to Iran, in breach of US sanctions. Telecoms giant Cisco on Monday ended its relationship with ZTE, Reuters reported, after its equipment was included in the Tehran deal. This latest report comes in the midst of a US presidential campaign in which China has become a hot topic. Both President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney have pledged to increase the pressure on Beijing on issues ranging from China's currency policy to state subsidies for Chinese firms. Earlier this month, Mr Obama signed an order blocking a deal by a Chinese firm, Ralls Corp, to acquire four wind farm projects near a US naval facility in Oregon.

At Manchester Crown Court, Bashir of Hebers Court, Middleton, Manchester, admitted two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Judge Richard Mansell said his decision on the sentence was guided by the fact he was \"not convinced [Bashir's then wife] was a vulnerable person\" as she was \"an intelligent woman with a network of friends\" and a degree. Despite acknowledging the attacks had an \"ongoing effect\" on his victim's ability to trust people, he sentenced Bashir, who played cricket for Oldham, to 18 months, suspended for two years. Speaking to the BBC, which has agreed not to use her name, Bashir's ex-wife said she was \"disappointed in the comments which the judge made about my vulnerability\". She added: \"I am a confident and strong woman because of what I have suffered. I was suffering for my life but the judge didn't believe me.\" The judge also ordered Bashir to attend a workshop entitled ''building better relationships'', pay \u00c2\u00a31,000 costs and banned him from contacting his ex-wife indefinitely. Ms Phillips, who is MP for Birmingham Yardley, said the judge's comments sent a \"dangerous\" message. \"Your vulnerability and your risk is a completely dynamic thing,\" she said. \"Everybody has a dynamic risk, I've met women who went on to be murdered who had law degrees, who were very eminent business people. \"There's no category that domestic violence does not touch. It does not follow class lines, it does not follow race lines, it does not follow age lines.\" Ms Miller, chair of the Women and Equalities Select Committee, told the BBC: \"The brutality of the sort of acts that have been outlined really make me believe that this was a devastating episode in the victim's life. \"I do think this needs to be properly understood by judges and it needs to be properly accounted for in sentencing.\" An apparent defence claim, noted by the judge, that a prison sentence would have lost Bashir a contract with Leicestershire County Cricket Club (LCCC) has been rejected by the club, which denies it has ever been in contact with Bashir. The CPS said: \"We are aware of recent developments relating to this case and are currently considering our options.\" Anna Soubry, Conservative MP Broxtowe in Nottinghamshire, said: \"Police need to get a statement from LCCC. \"They may want to consider whether any other charge needs to be brought if the defendant has deliberately advanced something that is not true to reduce the sentence and/or keep him out of prison.\" While the offence is not one where the sentence can be referred to the Court of Appeal as \"unduly lenient\", the judge has 56 days to recall it if doubt is cast on the grounds for the sentence.", "abstract": "MPs have criticised a judge over a suspended jail term given to a man who attacked his wife with a cricket bat.", "candidate": "A judge's decision to give a suspended sentence to a cricketer who beat his ex-wife with a cricket bat has been criticised by two MPs.", "doc_id": 1714, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "A judge's decision to give a suspended sentence to a cricketer who admitted assaulting his ex-wife has been criticised by two MPs.", "evidence": "At Manchester Crown Court, Bashir of Hebers Court, Middleton, Manchester, admitted two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.", "explanation": "Summary mentions beating with a cricket bat which is not present in the source text.", "instruction": "Remove the information about weapon used for assault i.e. a cricket bat from the summary.

{"article": "The Information Commissioner is to be asked to overrule a decision by the National Archives to keep the documents about the trial of Stephen Ward hidden. The submission is being made by lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC. It is believed Ward killed himself as his trial for living off immoral earnings was ending. Ward, an artist and osteopath living in London, had in 1961 introduced 21-year-old reputed call girl Christine Keeler to the Secretary of State for War, John Profumo. The minister and Ms Keeler - who is also thought to have had relations with an attache at the Russian embassy, Yevgeny Ivanov - started an affair. When challenged, Profumo initially denied the relationship - but was later forced to admit that he had lied in March 1963, in a scandal that threatened to topple the Conservative government of the time. Ward, who many believe was a victim of a cover-up, is understood to have killed himself on the last day of his trial at the Old Bailey, where he was found guilty of living off the immoral earnings of Ms Keeler and her friend Mandy Rice-Davies, who were referred to at the time of the court case as prostitutes. Mr Robertson, the author of Stephen Ward was Innocent, OK, said that he was making the appeal because keeping documents about Ward's trial hidden \"was irrational and ignores the public interest and the interests of history in discovering the truth about Ward's conviction, which is widely viewed as a miscarriage of justice\". He added: \"Releasing the official trial transcript is important to work out why Ward was ever prosecuted, and it will assist the case for overturning his conviction.\" The National Archives refused Mr Robertson access to most of its file on Ward, which is believed to include the police statements used to charge him with living off the earnings of Ms Keeler and Ms Rice-Davies. Mr Robertson argues in his book that neither woman was a prostitute, and both in fact lived off Ward's earnings as a celebrated osteopath and portrait artist. The file on Ward is currently closed from public view until 2046, because this is 100 years after the birth of Ms Rice-Davies, the youngest of the trial witnesses. The Information Commissioner is set to make a decision to see if it can be opened earlier. According to Mr Robertson, this \"will cast an important new light on one of the worst miscarriages of justice in modern British history, and help explain how Stephen Ward was made the scapegoat for the Profumo affair by prosecuting him for crimes that neither he nor anyone else ever committed\".

{"article": "Lord Patten, who supports the UK remaining in the EU, said Mr Johnson, a prominent Leave campaigner, \"just makes it up as he goes along\". He also said it would be \"very difficult\" for David Cameron to remain leader if the UK voted to leave the EU. Vote Leave said it was saddened at \"the level of debate\" from the Remain camp. Mr Johnson has previously said voters want proper debate and to hear about the issues, \"not personal attacks\". The UK decides whether to stay in or leave the European Union in a referendum on 23 June. The Conservative Party is deeply split over the the issue, with David Cameron and most of his cabinet campaigning for a Remain vote but about half of the MPs supporting an EU exit. The debate inside the party has turned increasingly acrimonious, with former deputy prime minister and pro-Remain campaigner Lord Heseltine recently accusing Mr Johnson of losing his judgement over the EU. Lord Patten, Tory party chairman from 1990 to 1992, added to that criticism of the former London mayor, in an interview with Newsnight's David Grossman on Friday. \"Boris just makes it up as he goes along, and you come across people like that,\" he said. \"There's a sense in which you can't call Boris a liar. I think he's one of those people in life who simply doesn't really understand the difference between fact and fiction.\" He added: \"If he can make a good joke by saying something, or if he can write a newspaper article by referring to Hitler and the European Union, he does it - and he doesn't think about it. \"He'll be saying the opposite in a few months' time.\" Lord Patten, a European commissioner from 2000 to 2004, said Mr Johnson was an \"amiable\" character, but added: \"Boris is Boris. Tommy Cooper was Tommy Cooper.\" In response, Vote Leave said: \"It's sad to see the level of debate the 'Remainers' have been reduced to. They were wrong about the euro then and they are wrong now.\" And speaking to BBC Newsnight, Leave campaigner Jacob Rees Mogg suggested that Lord Patten's \"anger is almost certainly synthetic\". The MP suggested Lord Patten was trying to \"bash down\" Mr Johnson because he knows that the former London mayor was \"hugely popular and trusted\" and was making the case for an EU exit \"exceptionally effectively\". The Daily Mail reported earlier this week that \"senior party figures\" had warned of a vote of no-confidence in Mr Cameron after 23 June, whatever the outcome, over his handling of the referendum campaign. On the question of re-uniting the Conservative Party after the referendum, Lord Patten said that if the UK voted to Leave the EU it would be \"very difficult\" for Mr Cameron to stay on as leader. \"Are people like Michael Gove and Mr Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith... are they all going to require Mr Cameron to go cap in hand around Europe for the next few years trying to negotiate new trade deals and new agreements with the EU? \"I don't know,\" he said. Lord Patten said if Britain voted to remain in the EU, Mr Cameron would have to assert his authority and try to bring the party together. But he suggested the PM should give Mr Johnson a challenging cabinet post, such as running the Department for Health. \"That will really test whether there is something behind all the jokes,\" he said. Lord Patten also criticised the wider Vote Leave campaign, saying it's objective appeared to be \"to keep the turnout as low as possible and to tell young people to stay at home and not vote\", which , he said, was \"extraordinary\". And he added: \"I worry that for a lot of the Brexiteers, in a sort of spittle-flecked way, this is a neverendum, not a referendum.\" Also in the interview, the former Tory party chairman conceded that he had made the wrong call on Britain joining the Euro. \"I put my hand up,\" he said. \"Everybody occasionally makes a mistake and I think I was wrong about that.\"", "abstract": "Boris Johnson does not seem to understand \"the difference between fact and fiction\", former Tory chairman Lord Patten has told BBC Newsnight.", "candidate": "Boris Johnson is \"one of those people in life who simply doesn't understand the difference between fact and fiction\", former Conservative Party chairman Lord Patten has said.", "doc_id": 2695, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "\"There's a sense in which you can't call Boris a liar.

Since his arrest, he has been lodged in government guest houses. The Supreme Court set the next hearing for 11 March. On Tuesday, Mr Roy apologised to the court saying his reasons for not appearing before the judges last Wednesday \"were genuine\". He said Sahara would sell its assets and pay back the investors and asked the judges to give him more time. But the court rejected his proposal saying \"we are not interested in selling the properties, you have been telling us for the last two years, it is your headache, you should have done it\". The judges also ordered police to take two other Sahara directors into custody and hold them until the next hearing. The case against Mr Roy stretches back to August 2012, when the court ordered the two Sahara firms implicated to refund money to 22 million small investors within 90 days and with 15% interest.

He said he would raise \"unnecessary\" tax burdens with the chief secretary to the treasury during the meeting. The Treasury said Scottish ministers had been advised of the tax situation before setting up national services. Most other police and fire services in the UK are regional bodies and do not have to pay VAT. The issue arose because Scotland's policing and fire services were previously controlled by local councils, which can claim back the tax - but the new national forces set up in 2013 are controlled by the Scottish government, which cannot. Mr Mackay said the police and fire services were struggling with the \"unnecessary\" burden of tax which they \"simple should not have to pay\". He said: \"This is a significant sum which other emergency services do not have to meet. \"There is a significant difference in the way VAT affects emergency services across the UK, with Scottish police and fire services paying VAT when other territorial services in the UK do not have to. \"There needs to be a level playing field for such essential services. \"As we continue to invest in our emergency services we will continue to press the UK government for Scottish emergency services to have the same ability to recover VAT as all other British and Northern Irish Forces.\" Scottish Lib Dem MSP Liam McArthur said it was right that the VAT position was \"reconsidered\", but said the Scottish government should not use that as a \"smokescreen\" for its own failures. He said: \"The financial mess that Police Scotland find itself in is down to the SNP's botched centralisation. Ministers cannot duck that.\" A Treasury spokeswoman said: \"In 2012 the Scottish government chose to make Scotland's police and fire services national rather than regional bodies. The Scottish government were advised in advance that by making this change Scottish police and fire services would become ineligible for VAT refunds.\" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon raised the issue during a clash over police budgets with Tory leader Ruth Davidson at Holyrood in December. Ms Sturgeon argued that the UK government had changed the rules to exempt academy schools from VAT when they were set up and funded by the central government. She said there was \"\u00a325m a year which should be going to our police service but is going to the Treasury\". Ms Davidson replied: \"The Scottish government was warned about VAT - it knew what would happen and it did not listen to parliament. You know that the first minister is in trouble when she cannot answer for herself but runs to 'Westminster bad'.\" There have been a series of warnings from auditors about financial management within Scotland's police service, which faces a funding gap of up to \u00a3200m in the coming years.", "abstract": "Scotland's finance secretary is to call on the UK government to scrap a \u00a335m annual tax bill for the country's police and fire services.", "candidate": "Scotland's finance secretary has called for a \"level playing field\" in the way VAT is paid by police and fire services.", "doc_id": 3304, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "Scotland's finance minister has called for a \"level playing field\" in the way VAT is paid by police and fire services.", "evidence": "Derek Mackay is meeting other finance ministers", "explanation": "Instead of Scotland's finance secretary, it should be Scotland's finance minister.1", "instruction": "Replace the information about Secretary with the information about Minister.", "instruction_list": ["Replace the information about Secretary with the information about Minister."]}}

The 2.4m euros (\u00c2\u00a31.8m) boat was built in England and is the smallest, fastest and lightest in the RNLI fleet. The boat was designed by Peter Eyre from Londonderry who was rescued by a Lough Swilly lifeboat when he was 14. Lough Swilly lifeboat operations manager John McCarter said it was an amazing new addition. \"It is probably the most advanced lifeboat that has entered the lifeboat fleet.

China is one of the biggest consumers of the commodity and there are concerns a slowdown in its economy may hurt demand and impact miners' profits.

Fortescue Metals tumbled nearly 10% in Sydney on Monday. Mining stocks listed in London were also hurt, with Anglo American, Antofagasta and Glencore Xstrata all down by more than 2%. Recent demand for minerals like iron ore and copper has been driven in part by China's export boom, as well as government-led infrastructure spending. That has seen miners become increasingly dependent on China for growth. However, over the weekend, China reported a surprise 18.1% fall in exports for February, compared to the same month last year. A fall in China's steel futures also hurt mining shares because iron ore is a key ingredient in steel manufacture.

After dismissing former England captain Alastair Cook cheaply on day two, Roland-Jones took his third wicket of the match with the 14th ball of the third morning, as Ravi Bopara was caught at third slip, continuing his poor batting form this season. That brought Wheater to the crease, and alongside Lawrence the pair dragged Essex away from a disastrous reply to Middlesex's 507-7 declared, but Wheater was eventually out to a brilliant one-handed tumbling catch by Stevie Eskinazi at square leg to reduce the visitors to 253-6. Ryan ten Doeschate (20) was then trapped plumb lbw by Tim Murtagh, Simon Harmer hit a wide ball to Eskinazi's hands, and Lawrence and Neil Wagner were dismissed by Finn (4-51) as the final four wickets tumbled in nine overs.

{"article": "In 1787, the 28-year-old Robert Burns was suddenly a \"celebrity\", according to Prof Nigel Leask, regius chair of English Language and Literature at the University of Glasgow. The 2nd Edinburgh edition of his poems had given him a quite a handsome pot of money and it had also made him famous, with the cream of Scottish society taking an interest in him. Prof Leask says: \"He was the lion of Scottish literature, everyone wants to meet him.\" And Burns also wants to meet them, especially if they have the power to promote his work further and the cash to buy his books. \"Poets in the 18th Century depended on patronage so he tours around the gentry and nobles, really doing a bit of salesmanship,\" says Prof Leask. Throughout 1787 Burns embarked on a series of tours, firstly around the Scottish Borders and northern England and then further afield to the west Highlands taking in Inveraray, Arrochar and dinner with Glasgow tobacco merchant George Buchanan at Arden House at Bannachra near Loch Lomond. Later in the year he toured the Highlands during which time he stayed with the Duke and Duchess of Atholl at Blair Castle, dined with the Duke and Duchess of Gordon at Castle Gordon and visited historical sites such as the Culloden battlefield and Cawdor Castle, which featured in Shakespeare's Macbeth. Prof Leask says that Burns seems to have had letters of introduction from Edinburgh patrons that gained him access to the upper-echelons of Scottish nobility. \"He's not overawed by his posh surroundings,\" says Prof Leask. \"It shows his amazing social versatility. He's got an ability to move in all the circles of society. \"There is a sense of how thoroughly he was in the society and culture of the late 18th Century.\" Prof Leask says: \"It slightly qualifies the image of the 'heaven-taught ploughman' who does not have formal qualifications, who is just a genius endowed by nature. \"This shows how learned he was, how much he knew.\" Prof Leask says the tours of the Highlands are also important because it was a Lowlander's encounter with Gaelic culture, the Highland culture of Scotland. During his travels he composes songs like the Birks of Aberfeldy and discovers his east coast heritage, visiting relatives in Stonehaven and Laurencekirk. His father's family had a strong connection to the Jacobites in the north east. As well as mixing with the Scottish nobility there was plenty of time for the rock star antics for which Burns has become well known. Prof Leask recounts how Burns stopped for the night at Arden House near Loch Lomond. \"He has a very convivial night of dancing and drinking and seeing the sun rise over Ben Lomond,\" says Prof Leask. \"He sets off the next day and has a horse race on the road down to Dumbarton with a Highland man he calls Donald, who is riding an unharnessed horse and Burns is riding Jenny Geddes, his old mare. \"He is determined not to be overtaken so he races and has an accident. \"It's a bit like two boy-racers on the A82 nowadays.\" The tour journals are included in the new \"Oxford Edition of the Works of Robert Burns: Commonplace Books, Tour Journals and Miscellaneous Prose\". Prof Leask says: \"This is the first time the tours have been edited to scholarly standards and cross-referenced with his poems, songs and letters. \"It enables the reader to get a good sense of how these tours contributed to his emergence as a major world poet.\"", "abstract": "At the height of his new-found fame Robert Burns embarked on a series of tours around Scotland, keeping company with some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the land.", "candidate": "As the 200th anniversary of the birth of Robert Burns is marked, BBC Scotland looks at his travels around Scotland in the 18th Century.", "doc_id": 1527, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Poet Robert Burns had many travels around Scotland in the 18th Century.", "evidence": "Throughout 1787 Burns embarked on a series of tours, firstly around the Scottish Borders and northern England and then further afield to the west Highlands taking in Inveraray, Arrochar and dinner with Glasgow tobacco merchant George Buchanan at Arden House at Bannachra near Loch Lomond.", "explanation": "the original summary is not correct because it adds info not found in the source text about the 200th anniversary of the poet's birth.", "instruction": "Remove the information about the birth anniversary of Burns from the summary.

{"article": "A report published by Alcohol Focus Scotland (AFS) claimed often concerns of local people were ignored by boards. It suggested more boards highlighted the economic importance of the licensed trade than the damaging consequences of alcohol. And it found more than half had extended licensing hours over the past six years. Boards must publish statements of licensing policy every three years, with the latest round to run until 2016. AFS analysed the 25 which had been published by the end of April 2014 and said some progress has been made in how they are controlling the availability of alcohol. But its chief executive, Dr Evelyn Gillan, said the licensing process was too removed from the people and neighbourhoods most affected by the boards' decisions. She said: \"Licensing boards have an important role in trying to minimise the harm that alcohol can cause because they have the power to control how much alcohol is available in their areas. \"The good news is that some boards are working well with the police and health professionals, declaring more areas of overprovision and actively seeking the views of local communities in licensing decision-making.\" However, she added: \"There is a lack of transparency about how the evidence of alcohol harm presented to licensing boards by health, police, and local people has been listened to and acted upon.\" The number of alcohol licences in Scotland has remained broadly static in recent years, according to government figures. In 2012/13 there were 16,237 premises licences across Scotland - 11,363 on-sales and 4,874 off-sales. That was slightly down on the previous 12 months (16,379), and on the figure for 2010/11 (16,377). Among the findings of the report were: .

They included in Glasgow, North Ayrshire, Aberdeen, Dumfries and Galloway, Highland and East Lothian. Fiona Moss, head of health improvement at Glasgow City Community Health Partnership said: \"We were invited to give evidence during the consultation process and I was pleased with the way the licensing board considered this evidence and listened to the principal health messages. \"I welcomed the board's decision not to further extend routine licensing hours and not to grant further breakfast licences within the new policy.\" The AFS report recommended boards should produce detailed statistics to enable effective monitoring of the licensing system.", "abstract": "Scotland's licensing boards have been urged to do more to protect communities from alcohol harm.", "candidate": "There is a \"lack of transparency\" in how Scotland's 25 licensing boards deal with alcohol, according to a charity.", "doc_id": 1680, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "There is a \"lack of transparency\" in how Scotland's licensing boards deal with alcohol, according to the AFS.", "evidence": "However, she added: \"There is a lack of transparency about how the evidence of alcohol harm presented to licensing boards by health, police, and local people has been listened to and acted upon.\"", "explanation": "Doesn't state AFS is a charity, doesn't state there are a qty of 25 licensing boards (25 decisions have been made)", "instruction": "Replace the information about charity with the information about AFS.

{"article": "Palm-sized fidget spinners have become the latest \"must-have\" for children. But while some schools have banned the toys as a distraction, Castle Gardens Primary School in Newtownards, County Down, has taken a different approach. The toys are being used as a teaching aid in some maths and English lessons. Primary four teacher Heather Hutchinson is behind the idea. \"These crazes come into school and you either go with them or they're a complete annoyance,\" she said. \"The children wanted to know whose spinner was going to spin the longest, so I saw an opportunity for a maths investigation.\" \"They timed each other's spin, recorded it on a table and then put it on to a graph.\" \"It was an opportunity for something a bit different with their learning.\" There are strict rules on when the spinners can be used in Ms Hutchinson's class, however. She collects them at the start of the school day and only hands them out for certain lessons. Her pupils have also honed their English skills by holding debates on whether they should be allowed in school and writing up their opinions. Despite all of the children owning fidget spinners, they are divided on their role in school. Eight-year-old Zach thinks they are a good idea. \"If you don't have neat writing you can spin them to help your finger muscles,\" he said. But his classmate Anna disagrees. \"I don't think they should be allowed in class, as they distract the teacher and if you were asked a question you wouldn't know what to do as you'd be sitting fidgeting,\" she said. Fidget spinners were originally developed as a way for children with Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism to relieve stress. When it is placed between the thumb and a finger, the child can give it a quick flick to trigger a spin. There are many different types but the most popular is a small, three-pronged one with rounded ends. There are many different types but the most popular is a small, three-pronged one with rounded ends. There have been safety concerns, however, about ones with sharp edges or spikes. Castle Gardens principal John Gray said his staff checked which fidget spinners children are bringing into school. \"It is using a degree of common sense,\" he said. \"Ones that are appropriate and safe will be used and if they're not, the children wouldn't be allowed to have them and they'll be returned to the parents at the end of the day.\" But he does think the devices have their place in the classroom if used well. \"If the children are engaged and enthusiastic about something, the quality of learning will be higher,\" he said. \"We wouldn't use them for every lesson. \"It would be the occasional opportunity to use them in a numeracy or literacy lesson to engage the children in activities they would be doing anyway. \"For example, they would be doing graph work so we're using something to record real data they've taken themselves. \"They then plot the graphs, but because they're recording something that interests them we find the quality of what they produce is that much better. \"If you're interested in doing something, you're learning that much more.\"", "abstract": "They are the new craze sweeping school playgrounds.", "candidate": "Fidget spinners have become the latest \"must-have\" for children.", "doc_id": 1330, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "Palm-sized fidget spinners have become the latest \"must-have\" for children.", "explanation": "The summary is a direct lift from the source text so it must be correct.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}
{"article": "The visitors' centre was one of the few elements of the County Antrim prison praised in a recent damning report. But the bus that took people between the centre and the prison stopped after the start of a new contract. The Northern Ireland Prison Service said it has arrangements in place to \"assist people with mobility issues\". Just before Christmas, a private company took over the running of the visitors' centre from the Quaker Service, a family support charity, and the bus service ended. Malcolm McCormick said that has made it difficult for people to visit the jail as it is too far to walk. He had been visiting a friend regularly in the prison, but because of his disabilities he could not drive and had to use public transport. But when he arrived at the visitors' centre at the start of December he was told he would have to make his own way to the prison entrance. \"[The prison] is not the right access level for visiting,\" he said. \"They really don't care about people who've got disabilities, or people who have to go visit their loved ones inside.\" Until December, Mr McCormick chose a train closest to his visit, and then waited at the visitors' centre until his time slot, like many other prison visitors. They were then taken to the main prison in a minibus, which, like the visitors' centre, was run by the Quaker Service. But when the contract for the visitors' centre was awarded to a private company, the provision of a bus was not included in the tender. It is about a quarter of a mile from the centre to the prison, which Mr McCormick said was too far for him and others, \"especially people with mobility problems, people with bad sight, or carrying children\". He said although a taxi was able to drop him at the main building from the train station, he was not able to wait in the prison building itself and that the visitors' centre was the only place people could wait. Mr McCormick felt his only option was to get a taxi all the way from Belfast, costing him \"about forty quid on each visit\". The recent report on Maghaberry Prison was damning on almost all fronts, but it did give one area a glowing review. It said: \"The welcoming visitors' centre continued to offer good support, including to first-time visitors who were identified. \"The bus transporting visitors between the visitors' centre, the searching area and the prison also now provided a service to and from the local Moira train station.\" Mr McCormick said the prison service needs to do more to help visitors. Raymond McCartney, the deputy chair of the Northern Ireland Assembly's justice committee, said there should be \"compassion\" shown to prisoners' families and friends visiting the jail. \"I think it's an important service - the distance from the visitors' centre to the front gate is considerable,\" he said. \"Recently, when I was in the prison and spoke to the senior managers, they believed a solution could be brought forward. \"I would be hopeful that, perhaps in the coming weeks, that we could see a resolution to this.\" In a statement, the Northern Ireland Prison Service said: \"The contract for the visitors' centre at Maghaberry was awarded through an open and transparent procurement competition. \"The prison service will continue to work with the provider to ensure that services are in place to support relationships between families and prisoners.\"", "abstract": "A disabled man has said his visits to Maghaberry Prison have become more difficult since changes were made to the visitors' bus service.", "candidate": "A disabled man who has visited Maghaberry Prison several times a year has said it is difficult for people with mobility problems to visit the jail.", "doc_id": 3510, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "He had been visiting a friend regularly in the prison, but because of his disabilities he could not drive and had to use public transport.", "explanation": "Does state that the man was disabled, the prison name is correct and he visited \"regularly\" which is equivalent to several times a year, verbatim said the quote.

{"article": "Scientists and celebrities were among those who turned out for the first March for Science, part of a string of events across the UK and the world. Organisers said the growth of fake news and misinformation made it crucial to highlight science's \"vital role\". It took place on Earth Day, which promotes environmental protection. Supporters gathered outside the Science Museum in Kensington, bearing placards on which double helices and chemical symbols sat alongside political slogans. Thousands then marched to Parliament Square passing institutions such as the Royal Society. Many of them were protesting against what they see as a trend among politicians for discrediting scientific research. Concerns that rhetoric threatens to override research flared in the UK last summer when former cabinet minister Michael Gove claimed during the EU referendum campaign that the public had \"had enough of experts\". In the US, President Donald Trump has previously called climate change a \"hoax\", raising concern in the scientific community there that the public were beginning to doubt the facts provided as scientific evidence. Organisers said the events were also a celebration of science and a call to support and safeguard the scientific community. Doctor Who star Peter Capaldi and comedian Robin Ince were among those who joined activists in London. Mr Ince, who hosts the scientific podcast The Infinite Monkey Cage, said: \"I think there are many reasons people are out here. \"I think we're worried about the fact there seems to be a reigniting of parochialism in politics... \"I think the idea of deriding experts, the idea of deriding people that spend their entire life researching and experimenting, is a return to charlatanism if we start doing that.\" The Commons Science and Technology Committee this month stressed the importance of allowing scientists and experts to come to the UK following Brexit. It followed a host of warnings from influential figures in the scientific community that divorce from the continent could have a crippling impact on research and provoke an exodus of talent. In March, Nobel Prize winning scientist Sir Paul Nurse said: \"I don't think there's anything in Brexit that helps universities, either in teaching or research, but we are where we are... we have to make the best of it.\" Parallel marches were hosted across the UK, including in Manchester, Bristol, Cardiff and Edinburgh.

The opposition blames the Socialist policies of Mr Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, for the country's economic decline. The government says the country's economic elite, backed up by conservative forces in the United States and other countries, has been plotting to topple the government. One of Mr Maduro's closest allies, Jorge Rodriguez, has been appointed to check whether there are any irregularities in the recall referendum process. \"We have found a huge fraud against the Constitution,\" he said, after beginning legal action at the Supreme Court. \"Stop lying to the international community and stop lying to the Venezuelan people,\" he said.

But Treasury minister Andrea Leadsom, who backs Brexit, said he was wrong. \"Obviously that is just an outrageous thing to say,\" she told the BBC. Allegations that hundreds of women were groped, robbed and intimidated at Cologne's central station on New Year's Eve emerged in January. Victims described chaos outside the city's main station, as the men - some of whom were identified in an official report as migrants or asylum seekers of North African and Arab origin - carried out dozens of attacks with little apparent response from the authorities. Mr Farage claimed women could be at risk because of \"very big cultural\" issues between British society and migrants if the UK voted to remain in the EU, according to the Sunday Telegraph. Asked whether mass attacks on the scale seen in Cologne could happen in Britain, he replied: \"It depends if they get EU passports. It depends if we vote for Brexit or not. It is an issue.\" The UKIP leader made the comments ahead of a live TV debate on ITV on Thursday. During last year's TV general election debates, Mr Farage sparked controversy by claiming foreign HIV patients were costing the NHS \u00c2\u00a325,000 each per year. \"The nuclear bomb this time would be about Cologne,\" he told the Telegraph. This issue covers immigration and free movement within Europe. Rather than backing her fellow Brexit campaigner's comments, Tory MP Ms Leadsom told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live: \"I don't like that sort of campaigning at all.\" \"However we know for a fact that there was an appalling experience for women over in Germany over the Christmas period. \"I do not approve of that sort of campaigning, I do not believe in outright blatant scaremongering so I think it's really, really regrettable. \"I haven't seen it and I wouldn't support suggesting if you vote to remain you'd be raped.\" Justice Secretary Michael Gove, a prominent Brexit campaigner, also refused to associate himself with Mr Farage's comments. \"He's made those remarks and I haven't made remarks like that and I won't make remarks like that,\" he told ITV's Peston on Sunday. Sal Brinton, president of the Liberal Democrats, said Farage had \"sunk to new depths in his scaremongering with these remarks which are completely unacceptable\". And Ryan Coetzee, director of strategy for the official remain campaign, Britain Stronger In Europe, tweeted to say Mr Farage's comments were \"disgraceful\", adding: \"Don't vote for this man's idea of Britain. But Mr Farage also told the Telegraph the \"honesty and straightforwardness\" of the prime minister was now being questioned by voters. Many believed Mr Cameron, who he dubbed \"Dishonest Dave\", had broken his promise to cut migration and renegotiate the UK's terms of membership of the EU, he said.

{"article": "The prime minister said he appreciated people were \"disillusioned\" with the EU and he \"absolutely understood and received the message\". He told the BBC that only Conservatives offered a referendum on UK membership. The BBC's Nick Robinson said this \"simple message\" instilled confidence for many within the party. UKIP gained 23 MEPs, with the Tories having 19, behind Labour which has 20. The Conservative share of the vote was 23.9%, behind Labour on 25.4% and UKIP on 27.5%. Some Conservative MPs have expressed dismay at the performance and Mr Cameron said he was \"disappointed\" for the MEPs - including its former leader in Brussels Martin Callanan - who lost their seats. But he said the vote reinforced his belief that the UK's relationship with the EU needed to change. \"I take a very clear message from the election. People are deeply disillusioned with the EU. They don't feel the current arrangements are working well enough for Britain and they want change. \"I would say that message is absolutely received and understood.\" While he was an instinctive \"reformer\" who, in the referendum would \"give the choice to the British people of whether to stay or go\", Labour backed the \"status quo\" in Europe and the Lib Dems did not want any change. Mr Cameron rejected suggestions that UKIP's victory was a snub for the Westminster elite in general and for Mr Farage's different campaigning style, saying the UKIP leader was a \"consummate politician\" who was already discussing tactics for the 2015 general election. He again dismissed any talk of pre-election pacts, at either a national or constituency level, saying he was \"100%\" focused on delivering an outright Conservative victory. He said Labour had got a lower share of the vote in the 2004 European election and managed to comfortably win a general election the year after. \"It is possible to win from here,\" he said. \"We have just got to have a real focus on what really matters which is completing our economic plan and turning our country round.\" Foreign Secretary William Hague said the rise of Eurosceptic parties should serve as a wake-up call to European politicians. UKIP's support would switch for next year's general election, he told BBC News. \"They can have a free hit; they can have a vote that does not have the consequences of bringing the wrong government in,\" he said. \"So it is very different to a general election.\" But backbencher Bernard Jenkin wrote on Twitter: \"Some of us who opposed Maastricht 20 years ago predicted it would lead to the rise of the right in the EU: and here we are.\" And Clacton MP Douglas Carswell added: \"So maybe those of us who sometimes banged on about Europe were on to something?\" The European election results come just days after the Conservative Party lost more than 200 seats in local polls, prompting ministers to promise tougher curbs on immigration.

They were also looking at cutting the length of time migrants could claim benefits from six months to three months, she said.

A coroner is writing to the director of Her Majesty's Prison Service demanding a review of the way officers are treated during disciplinary proceedings. The inquest heard Ms Norridge had ambitions of becoming a prison governor but was hit by a health scare - a relative had died of bowel cancer and she tested positive for a gene which gave her an 80 per cent chance of also getting the disease.

{"article": "The All Party Parliamentary Group on Hunger warns too many children have to survive on crisps and energy drinks when school kitchens are closed. One group had to drop out of a summer football scheme because they had not eaten a meal in days, its report says. The Department for Work and Pensions says it is committed to tackling child poverty and disadvantage. According to the report, children at risk of holiday hunger include an estimated: . For both groups, school holidays place extra burdens on family budgets in terms of food, fuel, activities and childcare. The report says this is sometimes \"compounded\" by a shortage of skills to cook and shop on a budget. It claims the loss of free school meals adds between \u00a330 and \u00a340 per week to parents' outgoings for one child. The Family and Childcare Trust told the inquiry that three out of four local authorities do not have enough childcare in the school holidays. Parents working on zero-hours contracts were said to be particularly vulnerable to the higher costs of childcare. Evidence during the two-month long inquiry to the group, included children reported to have vomited from lack of food, while others were being fed flavoured water or cereal as their parents could not afford proper meals for them. Referring to the group which had to drop out of playing football, the report says: \"Their bodies simply gave up on them,\" says the report. Too many children return to school malnourished, sluggish and dreary, says the report. They are often weeks or months intellectually behind their better-off classmates who have a more wholesome diet during the holidays, it adds. It urges the government to set aside 10% of the tax on sugary drinks, due to start next year, to allocate \u00a3100,000 to every council to fund schemes to ensure that children are properly fed during the school holidays. It claims the cost of providing free meals and activities during holidays can be \u00a31.50 per child per day. The report urges ministers to impose a statutory requirement on local authorities to run schemes delivering \"free meals and fun\" for children during school holidays, with voluntary groups \"in the driving seat wherever possible\". In the \"fifth richest country in the world, too many children are stalked by hunger,\" said committee chairman Frank Field in his foreword, describing the evidence as \"staggering\". While highlighting examples of those tackling the problem, he said \"abolishing hunger during school holidays is beyond the ability of individual community groups and volunteers alone\". Dr Philippa Whitford, a vice chair of the group, said that losing access to free school meals during the holidays could \"simply be the final straw which overwhelms some families' ability to keep their children fed and, particularly, nourished\". \"Hidden hunger does not just result in underweight children... those who are eating a stodgy low-protein diet, with no fresh fruit or vegetables, can end up both obese and yet malnourished,\" she said. In its response to the report, the Department for Work and Pensions also said the employment rate was the joint highest since records began and the number of children growing up in workless families is at a record low. A spokesman added that more than \u00a390bn a year was being spent on working age benefits to provide a \"safety net\".

Just before half-time Ards keeper Ryan Brown made a brilliant save from striker David McDaid's penalty. McDaid did make it 2-0 on 62 minutes by turning the ball in from about six yards and late on sub Stephen Garrett wrapped it up with a close-range third. Seconds before Donnelly had netted the opener, Ards fluffed a great chance to take the lead when Jordan Baker put a six-yard header wide. And, just after going 2-0 down, Ards half-time substitute Stephen O'Neill went close to scoring against his former club but saw a header cleared off the line. The historic win also brought a first trophy for manager Gerard Lyttle, who last October took on the job of succeeding Tommy Breslin, the north Belfast club's most successful manager. Breslin, who had guided the Reds to eight trophies, stood down after Cliftonville's early-season league form stuttered. Lyttle, with Celtic for a spell as a player, took over originally on a temporary basis. But, after a promising start results-wise, the Solitude board gave Lyttle the full seal of approval and they will feel vindicated by this success. Ards had gone into the final as massive underdogs, even more so having agreed to play on their opponents' ground, rather than a neutral venue, to benefit from bigger gate receipts.

Numbers of manx shearwaters and storm petrels had declined by 25% on St Agnes and Gugh in 25 years. But colonies are recovering thanks to the rat eradication measures. Poison placed in an agricultural pipe was positioned in 1,000 locations on the islands in order to kill the vermin. According to international protocols, the islands could not be officially declared rat-free for two years after the last sign of rat was detected - making them officially free of the rodent on 13 February. Jaclyn Pearson, from the RSPB Isles of Scilly seabird recovery project, said the seabird population was already starting to recover. \"Straight away we saw results,\" she said. \"The baiting was done in winter 2013, and in September 2014 we had 10 Manx Shearwater chicks.

{"article": "Reform Scotland said its research suggested more than half of delays to trains in Scotland were due to Network Rail faults rather than ScotRail. It said devolving the organisation would allow a \"clear line of accountability\" when things go wrong. Network Rail is funded by Transport Scotland but is ultimately accountable to Westminster, not Holyrood. A spokesman for Network Rail said: \"We work closely with the Scottish and UK governments to continually enhance and improve our railways. Any discussions over further devolution of Network Rail in Scotland would be a matter for those governments\". The full devolution of Network Rail - which is responsible for maintaining rail infrastructure - has been a long-standing ambition of the Scottish government. Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said last month that the move would help to reverse \"the current unacceptable industry performance\" in Scotland. It comes amid ongoing concern over delays and cancellations to ScotRail trains since Dutch firm Abellio took over the contract last year, which has led to Mr Yousaf suggesting that the rail franchise could be taken over by the public sector in the future. Mr Yousaf is to attend a conference on Tuesday alongside Abellio and Network Rail officials aimed at exploring the future of Scotland's railways. In its Track to the Future report, Reform Scotland said 54% of trains which were delayed by more than three minutes had been attributed to Network Rail faults. The report was written by Reform Scotland's research director Alison Payne and Tom Harris, the former Labour MP and UK transport minister. Mr Harris said: \"The current debate over whether or not to nationalise ScotRail misses the point. 54% of delays are the fault of Network Rail. Nationalising ScotRail won't make the trains run on time and it is self-defeating for any politician to imply otherwise. \"Instead, we need fundamental change to the governance of Network Rail. The Scottish government is responsible for the strategic direction and funding of the Scottish rail network, but this responsibility cannot be properly exercised while Network Rail remains answerable to the UK government. \"Reform Scotland believes that Network Rail in Scotland should be fully accountable to the Scottish government, and that means it must be devolved.\" The report, which examines the modernisation of Scottish railways, also found that journey times in Scotland compared unfavourably with those of a similar distance in England. For example, Edinburgh to Aberdeen and London to Birmingham are roughly the same distance, but the former takes well over two hours and the latter less than 90 minutes. Birmingham and Manchester are 25% further apart than Glasgow and Dundee, but the train takes 15 minutes less to arrive. While it welcomed recent investment in the railways, the report said upgrading lines while trying to use them could cause additional problems and added that investments such as the Borders Railway had been \"short-sighted\". The new line from Edinburgh to Tweedbank is not electrified and is single-track. The report said the Scottish government should future-proof all new rail investment by ensuring that it is double-track and electrified where possible. And it called for the creation of a \"bold and ambitious\" Scottish Rail Infrastructure Commission to look into faster rail links for the future, including from the central belt to both the north and the south, and looking at strategic inter- and intra-city rail links within Scotland. The report found that, under current proposals, over the next 30 years people will be able to travel by train from the central belt to London faster than from the central belt to Inverness, despite the former being around 400 miles while the latter is only 160 miles. Mr Harris added: \"Ongoing improvements are vital and the Scottish government should be congratulated for investing in this area, but we need to think about the bigger picture and create a bold strategy for the future. \"Our rail infrastructure is deficient. We should not tolerate a situation where a resident of Glasgow can get to London faster than she can get to Inverness, because Scotland's cities are too poorly connected.\"", "abstract": "Calls for the Scottish Parliament to be given full responsibility over Network Rail have been backed by a think tank.", "candidate": "Network Rail should be devolved to the Scottish government, according to a new report.", "doc_id": 1573, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "\"Reform Scotland believes that Network Rail in Scotland should be fully accountable to the Scottish government, and that means it must be devolved.\"", "explanation": "Source text states that a research report by Reform Scotland believes that Network Rail should be devolved to the govt. of Scotland, hence it supports the summary.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

Collin, who joined Rotherham from Carlisle United in 2013, has played twice this season. But he has not featured since August and recently found himself relegated to third choice. Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes hopes to have Ward available to face Ross County in their Scottish Premiership game in Dingwall. \"We're still waiting for international clearance for Adam and I'll announce the team on Sunday morning,\" he said. \"We'd assurances from Liverpool that Danny could stay, but their circumstances changed, so we're delighted to get Adam on board.\" Ward impressed during his spell with the Dons and, on his return to Anfield, was immediately handed a place on the bench for the game against Arsenal.

{"article": "The Markit construction purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 55 from 57.8 - well below the 57.5 forecast by economists. The figure contrasted with a stronger-than-expected start for the manufacturing sector published on Monday. Factory output rose from 52.1 in December to 52.9 in January. Any figure above 50 indicates growth in the sector. Markit economist Tim Moore said construction firms were struggling for momentum, with increased economic uncertainty holding back new orders and contributing to one of the weakest rises in output levels since summer 2013. \"Taken together with the slowdown in new order growth, the latest survey suggests that construction companies are braced for a relatively subdued first quarter,\" he said. David Noble, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, which compiles the survey along with Markit, said a shortage of bricks and blocks contributed to the slowdown. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said weakness in construction orders and a downturn in public sector infrastructure work, which accounts for about a quarter of total construction and is not covered by the PMI, suggested the sector would post only \"lacklustre growth\" this year. Optimism among construction companies waned to its lowest level since December 2014, the survey showed. \"Some firms highlighted concerns that underlying demand conditions had started to soften,\" Markit said.

{"article": "They will meet on Monday afternoon to decide their response. The boss of the bank has described this plan as getting \"several holes in one in a row\". Golfers will know how hard that is and the wind of political risk has just picked up. If they do decide the plan is now too risky then the government may have no choice but to nationalise the bank. That would trigger a so-called \"bail in\" which means people who lent the bank money would have to write it off. Unfortunately, 65% of those creditors are ordinary retail investors so the damage would be widespread and politically toxic. There is another option. The Italian government could decide to simply break the rules and nationalise the bank without hitting small investors. That might be politically expedient but would be bitterly opposed in Germany and would set back immeasurably the project of banking union (separating the financial risk of banks from their governments - a move that came in response to the eurozone crisis of 2012).

The piece is the oldest of six remaining depictions of the palace, considered to be one of the Renaissance period's most stunning buildings.

It was intended to rival the opulent residences of French king Francis I. In 1670 Charles II gave the palace to his mistress, Barbara Villiers, who began to dismantle and sell parts of the building to pay off gambling debts. By 1690 the building had all but disappeared.

{"article": "The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut its key rate to 2.75% from 3%. The bank said it expected investment in the resources sector, one of its biggest drivers of growth in recent times, to peak this year. It added that a rate cut would provide a boost to other areas of the economy and help sustain long-term growth. \"There has been a strengthening in consumption and a modest firming in dwelling investment, and prospects are for some increase in business investment outside the resources sector over the next year,\" the central bank said in a statement. \"These developments, some of which have been assisted by the reductions in interest rates that began 18 months ago, will all be helpful in sustaining growth.\" Australia's economic growth in recent years has been fuelled by the growing demand for its commodities, such as iron ore. That resulted in a resources boom in Australia and helped it sustain growth through the global financial crisis. However, as demand from key markets such as China has eased, there have been concerns that Australia's mining sector may see its growth slow. At the same time, many analysts have pointed out that other areas of the country's economy have not done so well, resulting in what many have termed a two-speed economy. To make matters worse, the Australian currency has strengthened - making its exports more expensive, as well as affecting sectors such as manufacturing and tourism. It rose nearly 9% against the US dollar between June 2012 and April 2013. Amid all these concerns, there have been calls for policymakers to take steps to help boost growth, especially in the non-mining sectors, to ensure that the economy continues to grow. Analysts said the cut in interest rates, which will help bring down borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, will help to provide some relief to those sectors and allay fears of an economic slowdown. \"Commodity prices have fallen and inflation has come in less than expected, and of course the Australian dollar through all of that has remained surprisingly strong,\" said Shane Oliver, chief economist with AMP Capital Investors. \"I think it was appropriate for the Reserve to provide a bit more confidence [so that] when the mining investment boom starts to wane the rest of the economy will fill the gap.\" The Australian dollar weakened slightly, dipping 0.7% against the US dollar, after the rate cut was announced.

He told members there were plans to use \u00c2\u00a31.8m from the Service Quality Incentive Regime (Squire) railway improvement fund, which is controlled by Abellio ScotRail alliance and built up through fines and penalties imposed for delays and other infractions. The cash had already been earmarked for \"other initiatives\". SNP MSP Christine Grahame asked Mr Verster if the firm, as a private company, could tell the government \"you're not having it\" over the Squire cash. He told her: \"We are busy discussing this with Transport Scotland and I prefer not to commit to a position yet.\" Ms Grahame said: \"So the scheme might not go ahead because you've not decided 'Yes, we're going to do this'?\" Mr Verster replied: \"I can't vouch for whether the scheme goes ahead or not. I can just comment on whether we will make that decision, and when we'll make the decision in the next couple of weeks in terms of how we will deploy the Squire fund.\" He said talks were ongoing about how the scheme would be funded, and said he had not thought of using the Squire money until it was suggested by the government. Labour MSP Rhoda Grant said: \"This is quite extraordinary. I was going to say this is policy made on the back of a fag packet, but I don't think it's even reached that stage of development.\" Liberal Democrat MSP Mike Rumbles said he had assumed the Scottish government would be paying for the free fares scheme. He said: \"It's not new money that the Scottish government is using, it's money that you were going to invest in the railways.\" He said it was \"completely inappropriate\" for the transport minister to ask for the money and it should up to Abellio ScotRail how to spend it, not the government. Mr Verster replied: \"We have a very constructive relationship with Transport Scotland and the Scottish government. A very open relationship. \"Now while we set may priorities of what we think would be best for customers, if Transport Scotland engages with us and makes alternative suggestions, of course we consider that. \"I don't think there's anything inappropriate about that. I think what is important is only one thing and that is customers in the end.\" Mr Yousaf was also originally scheduled to give evidence to the committee, but this was postponed as he was unwell. A spokesman for the Scottish government said it \"remains absolutely committed\" to the scheme. He said: \"A free week's travel will be offered this year and further discounts for daily, weekly and leisure travellers. \"The ScotRail contract permits Squire funding to be directed to initiatives that improve the customer service experience, and we are currently negotiating the terms of the fares initiative with ScotRail through Transport Scotland, with the details expected to be finalised and announced in the coming weeks.\"", "abstract": "A government scheme to compensate rail passengers with free tickets may not go ahead unless it is fully funded.", "candidate": "The boss of ScotRail has told MSPs he cannot \" vouch\" for plans for free rail fares.", "doc_id": 1303, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "He said he had been told to use money from a rail improvement fund already earmarked for other projects, and \"couldn't vouch\" for it going ahead.", "explanation": "He said they planned a free week and that he couldn't be sure it would go ahead, so it's valid.

{"article": "The leaks from a secret BND report suggest that its monitoring station at Bad Aibling spied on France's presidential palace and foreign ministry, and the European Commission. The US National Security Agency also allegedly spied on some European firms. German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere denies claims of a cover-up. The BND reportedly collected information on European firms at Washington's behest to check if they were breaking trade embargos. According to the reports, the BND did not target German or US officials in the surveillance, as they are protected by a BND-NSA agreement signed in 2002. However, it has emerged that the German government knew about NSA spying on European arms businesses as early as 2008. The government found \"shortcomings\" in the BND's operations, German TV reports. Minister under pressure - by the BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin: . Yesterday the tabloid newspaper Bild printed a picture of Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere - his nose elongated to Pinocchio proportions. \"Herr de Maiziere!\" the accompanying headline screamed. \"You lie with impunity!\" There's outrage here that Germany - for so long seen as the victim of American espionage - may have helped US spies to target other Europeans. And pressure is building on the government to reveal how much it knew. As the former minister in charge of the chancellery, Thomas de Maiziere was directly responsible for Germany's foreign intelligence agency, the BND, in 2008. And that is when, it's claimed, the BND first told the chancellery that its agents were now helping the NSA to spy on European aviation, aerospace and defence companies. Mr de Maiziere has denied all knowledge, and maintains that he hasn't deceived anyone. But he says that - because the information is all classified - he is unable to comment publicly. Yet there are questions about who else was aware. Another German newspaper devoted its front page to a \"wanted\" poster. Among the mugshots of politicians and civil servants was Chancellor Angela Merkel herself. Spy scandal turns tables on German government . Mr de Maiziere denies having had any knowledge of malpractice at German intelligence. But he called for the internal BND report to be presented to a parliamentary committee, \"the sooner the better\". The huge scale of NSA surveillance in Europe - including joint spying operations with the UK's GCHQ - was revealed in 2013 by US whistleblower Edward Snowden. There was outrage in Germany because of the scope of NSA spying, which allegedly included snooping on Chancellor Merkel's mobile phone conversations. The revelations strained German-US diplomatic ties. Last July Germany expelled a CIA official based at the US embassy, as reports surfaced of several Germans having spied for the NSA. Germany's leftist Die Linke party accused the German government on Wednesday of \"lying\" in connection with NSA activities.

{"article": "It comes after local media reported he had served time for molesting two girls under 10 in the late 1990s. The man and his wife took home only one baby from Thailand after the surrogate had twins, leaving behind son Gammy. The case has made international headlines, causing uproar in Australia. State authorities told the BBC they were now conducting a \"full investigation\" to assess the father's \"suitability\" to have a young child in his custody. A spokesman for Western Australia's department for child protection and family support told the BBC: \"Last night we were made aware of certain information by the police regarding allegations of the father's criminal background.\" Asked if convicted sex offenders have been allowed to keep their children, the spokesman said they assess cases based on \"individual circumstances\". Besides Down's syndrome, the six-month-old baby has a congenital heart condition and a lung infection. Surrogate mother Pattharamon Chanbua has been looking after Gammy as well as two children of her own. She claims his parents abandoned Gammy and had asked her to have an abortion when she was told of the child's condition four months after becoming pregnant. Ms Chanbua, 21, has said the father met the twins, but only took care of the girl and refused to carry or look at Gammy even though the babies were side by side. The parents have told local media in Australia that they did not know of his existence, and claimed that the allegations made by Ms Chanbua are lies. But one local newspaper quoted a family friend saying the parents did know about the boy being born, apparently contradicting their version of events. \"Gammy was very sick when he was born and the biological parents were told he would not survive and he had a day, at best, to live and to say goodbye,\" the friend said. She suggested Ms Chanbua, 21, had broken the surrogacy agreement by giving birth in a smaller hospital instead of an international one, which meant that the biological parents had no legal rights to the babies. The couple had been locked in a legal battle with Ms Chanbua to take home their daughter and she had insisted on keeping Gammy to give him a Thai funeral, the friend alleged. Both the Australian government and Thai health authorities are now looking into the case and the larger issue of commercial surrogacy in Thailand, which is mostly unregulated.

A source close to President Ghani told the BBC's Afghan service that Gen Dostum's decision to return without consulting the authorities in Kabul had caused suspicion. \"We wanted him to come to Kabul... because we wanted to have a clear understanding of what's going on,\" the source said. \"There are no legal hurdles for him to return, the government has no issues, but he has to take the right route.\" Gen Dostum, Atta Mohammad and Mohammad Mohaqeq, another influential ethnic leader, recently formed an opposition group calling for major political reforms. They want to trim the powers of the president, whom they accuse of accumulating power. Gen Dostum's officials have denied he was on the plane that was turned away. But one of the men tasked with preparing for his return confirmed to the BBC that Gen Dostum had spoken with his men from Ankara on Monday morning. He had directed them to co-ordinate with Atta Mohammad and Mohammad Mohaqeq and to organise a major event to launch the new coalition. The vice-president is a former warlord with decades of experience in Afghanistan's turbulent political arena. He has been blamed for some of the worst atrocities in the country's long-running civil war, but joined its national unity government in 2014. The allegations against him come from Ahmad Eshchi, a former ally, who says he suffered days of severe beatings and sexual abuse at Gen Dostum's command. He said the vice-president and 10 other men assaulted him while he was forcibly kept at Gen Dostum's residence in November 2016. The ex-warlord denies the claims and has said that Mr Eshchi was detained by the country's intelligence service. In 2008 Gen Dostum went to Turkey amid similar allegations that his personal militia had abducted, beaten and sexually assaulted a political rival in Kabul, then fired on police who responded to the incident.", "abstract": "Afghan Vice-President Abdul Rashid Dostum tried to fly back from Turkey late on Monday but was denied permission to land, officials say.", "candidate": "A plane carrying Afghan Vice-President Abdul Rashid Dostum has been turned away from an airport in the north of the country.", "doc_id": 3449, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "A plane carrying Afghan Vice-President Dostum has been turned away from an airport in the north of the country.", "evidence": "Atta Mohammad Noor, the powerful governor of northern Balkh province, was waiting at Mazar-e Sharif airport to meet Gen Dostum on Monday night, the Pajhwok news agency reported", "explanation": "it makes up his first and middle names", "instruction": "Remove the information about his first and middle names from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about his first and middle names from the summary."]}}

The big-name pair-ups included Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga, who performed Irving Berlin's Cheek To Cheek. Rihanna arrived in a pink layered dress by Giambattista Valli. Katy Perry mingled with fans before swapping fashion tips (possibly) with Rihanna. Perry then changed clothes - and hair - to perform her ballad By the Grace of God as part of a poignant segment highlighting domestic abuse. Kanye West appeared in a single spotlight to perform Only One, which he wrote with Sir Paul McCartney.

{"article": "Scientists carried out a series of experiments to assess the economic and ecological importance of the nocturnal insect-eating mammals to farmers. Globally, bat populations are under pressure as a result of habitat loss and the spread of diseases. The findings appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \"The results of this study are a testament to the value of ecosystem services,\" said co-author Josiah Maine from Southern Illinois University. (Source: US Fish & Wildlife Service) Bats videos, news and facts from BBC Nature . In North America, many bat populations are under threat from a disease called White-Nose Syndrome. Since 2007, the disease has killed millions of bats and continues to spread. The US National Wildlife Health Centre estimated that bat populations in the north-east of the country have declined by about 80% since the first reported cases of bat fatalities as a result of the disease. It added: \"The true ecological consequences of large-scale population reductions currently underway among hibernating bats are unknown. However, farmers might feel the impact.\" Mr Maine told BBC News that he was interested in finding out how effective bats were in terms of providing a pest control service to farmers growing corn (maize). The team constructed a number of exclosures (a controlled, open-air experimental area) measuring 20 metres by 20 metres and seven metres high, consisting of netting that was suspended by cables. \"This netting allowed the insects to move freely but prevented bats from foraging in those areas,\" He explained. \"We were only interested in excluding the bats so we constructed the exclosures so all the netting could be slid to one end so we could open them up during the day to allow birds to forage in the area.\" Using the data gathered from the field study and combining with other previously published data, the team was able to extrapolate the findings to a global scale and estimate a monetary value for the ecological service provided by bats in terms of pest control in cornfields. The team wrote: \"We estimate that the suppression of herbivory by insectivorous bats is worth more than US$1bn globally on this crop alone.\" Mr Maine told BBC News: \"Bear in mind that this figure does not take into account for the impacts of bats on the fungal diseases we found in the corn, or the micro-toxins produced by those fungal species. \"It also does not account for the reduced amount of pesticides used in fields, as bats could be providing an additional valuable service to agriculture by suppressing pest populations below the threshold where pesticides are necessary.\" Farmers' friend . According to the IUCN's Bat Specialist Group (BSG), bat species account for one fifth of all terrestrial mammals. As well as being an important predator of insects, bats are also considered to be key seed dispersers and pollinators for many plants. Yet, the BSG observed: \"They are among the most endangered of the world's creatures, primarily because much of their habitat has been eliminated by human development or because they are persecuted. \"Their loss has serious consequences for the ecosystems to which they belong.\" An earlier study, publish in Science in April 2011, warned that the loss of bat species in North America could lead to agricultural losses in the region of US$3.7bn each year. The authors observed: \"Urgent efforts are needed to educate the public and policymakers about the ecological and economic importance of insectivorous bats and to provide practical conservation solutions.\" Mr Maine echoed this view: \"Bats are maligned in the media and there is a public fear, so if we can demonstrate a valuable, positive impact of bats then it is good for the species and it is good for society. \"What it suggests is that conservation is necessary not just from an ethical stance but from an economic standpoint as well.\"", "abstract": "Bats provide a service worth an estimated US $1bn (\u00c2\u00a3649m) globally by controlling pests on corn crops, a study has suggested.", "candidate": "Bats are worth more than US$1bn (\u00a3640m) a year in terms of pest control for corn crops, a study suggests.", "doc_id": 1455, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "The team wrote: \"We estimate that the suppression of herbivory by insectivorous bats is worth more than US$1bn globally on this crop alone.\"", "explanation": "it correctly pulls all the info (dollar amount, type of crop/animal) from the source text", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}
{"article": "Christine Chapman, of the assembly's Communities Committee, said good work was being done - but the Welsh government should speed up efforts. The latest figures suggest more than one in five people in Wales are living in poverty. The Welsh government said getting people out of poverty was at the \"very heart\" of what it does. Earlier this year, the Communities Committee published a report that stated it was \"deeply concerned by the Welsh government's lack of progress in reducing poverty\". Poverty is statistically defined as a household income below \u00c2\u00a3271 a week - 60% of the national mid-point average of \u00c2\u00a3453. Figures from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation suggest 23% of people in Wales are living in poverty - a figure which the committee said has barely changed since the early 2000s. Labour AM Christine Chapman said the Welsh government was \"going in the right direction\" but the pace of change \"needs to be quicker\". \"We are a rich country in the main but yet people are still struggling with their heating bills, with their food - that is absolutely appalling,\" she said. \"There must be a strong message first of all to the UK government that things need to change.\" Gemma Jones, a caseworker for Rhondda Cynon Taff Citizens Advice, said despite government initiatives, she sees little evidence of improvement. \"I don't know what's going wrong or what's happening but we're certainly seeing a lot more clients in poverty and not saying I'm better off,\" she said.

Masses of listeners are defecting to private channels such as RMC and Europe 1. And there is the same empty airtime on the six other channels that operate from Maison de la Radio in Paris (France Inter, France Bleu, France Culture, France Musique, FIP and Le Mouv'). No-one can remember a strike at Radio France lasting this long, because no strike ever has. There is a reason for that. For decades Radio France has enjoyed the status of a cosseted state asset. Constantly lauded - its mission of public service placing it above reproach - the corporation never felt the stern hand of reform. But now the country's coffers are empty. There is no more buying off the protest with a sneaky handout from the culture ministry. Today the years of accumulated waste and inefficiencies cry out for an overhaul. A report a couple of weeks ago from the French treasury watchdog, the Cour des Comptes, showed the scale of the problem. From 2004 to 2013, expenditure at Radio France went up 27.5% - with no increase in audience. Salary costs went up by 47% because at a time of growing pressure on jobs everywhere else Radio France took on 20% more staff. Because of the layers of accumulated privileges (often negotiated with unions after previous strikes), the 5,000 workers enjoy up to 68 working days off a year - more than 13 weeks. There are 388 staff members who are paid union representatives - a whopping 8% of the workforce. Renovation of Radio France's landmark Seine-side headquarters was supposed to cost 262m euros (\u00c2\u00a3191m, $285m). Instead it is costing 575m euros. Changing all this requires a mix of vision, toughness and dialogue, but the man whose job it is might have been purpose-picked to antagonise the unions. Radio France's new president Mathieu Gallet is handsome, young, energetic - and right-wing. One of his previous jobs was in the culture ministry under President Nicholas Sarkozy. Mr Gallet has warned that the corporation's annual deficit of 21m euros is unsustainable. He wants a voluntary redundancy plan to shed 300 or so jobs. He says that Radio France's two orchestras are one too many; that the separate news rooms at France Inter, France Info and France Culture need to be integrated; and that the network of local stations at France Bleu should commission shared material. But all this has merely infuriated the unions at Radio France. The hardliners there mainly represent technicians, although many journalists have also stopped work. The strikers have made it quite clear that they want Mr Gallet to go. And usefully they have discovered that even as he was advising drastic cuts at the corporation, he spent 100,000 euros doing up his personal office there. It is the sort of gaffe that could easily have brought him down. But so far Mr Gallet continues with the backing of the Socialist government, which presumably sees as well as he does the inevitability of reform. For those of us who depended on France-Info's round-the-clock news output, it is an infuriating time. Though the station has a discernible left-wing bias - the ratio of union leaders to company bosses interviewed must be about five to one - it is in general thorough and professional. It is also, by comparison with private stations, mercifully light on adverts (though, for all its vaunted public sector ethos, Radio France does permit some).

{"article": "The organisations behind the complaint say it is the biggest constitutional complaint in German history. They say the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (Ceta) deal violates democratic principles and will give too much power to multinational companies. But the German economy minister says a ruling in favour of the petitioners would be \"a catastrophe\". The Constitutional Court in the south-western city of Karlsruhe is due to rule on the emergency appeal on Thursday. The deal has already been agreed after years of negotiations - but if this petition is successful, correspondents say, it is extremely unlikely to be signed as scheduled at the end of October. Protests in Germany against transatlantic TTIP and Ceta trade deals . EU Commission refuses to revise Canada Ceta trade deal . Belgian province may sink EU-Canada trade deal . Three activist groups gathered more than 125,000 signatures which they passed to the court in 70 boxes of documents in August. They are Compact, Foodwatch and More Democracy. Their legal objection to the deal is that parts of it can come into force even before national parliaments have ratified it, thus breaching the German constitution. \"Not a single parliament elected by me - neither the Bundestag nor the European Parliament - was given a mandate to negotiate for Ceta,\" says Roman Huber of More Democracy. Its most visible opponent on Tuesday was German Economy Minister and Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel. He has already battled to win his Social Democratic Party (SPD) round to the deal. He told the court that a successful challenge to Ceta would undermine Germany's credibility, reported Die Welt news website. \"I do not want to imagine what that could mean for Europe,\" he told the court. Activists fear that the deals could water down European standards in the key areas of workers' rights, public health and the environment. They say it will open up new areas for privatisation and give corporations new powers to make profits. They say it would give corporations the ability to sue governments through a special corporate court if they try to implement policies or regulations that could reduce the profits a company is expecting to make - for example, by increasing the minimum wage. Opponents also point to the complexity of the deal - suggesting that many deputies won't have read the 1,500-page document in full. Some argue that Ceta will allow many of the provisions in TTIP - the controversial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership deal between the US and Europe - in through the back door. In August, Mr Gabriel was among leading European politicians who acknowledged that opposition meant the TTIP deal was effectively dead in the water. The court in Karlsruhe is due to rule on Thursday. If it rejects the complaints, European ministers are scheduled to approve the deal on 18 October, paving the way for it to be signed at a summit with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on 27 October. But if it fails the whole process could be upended, Mr Gabriel and Ceta opponents such as the Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern agree. Some, such as the head of Germany's Left party Katja Kipping, argue that the scale of opposition to Ceta is such that a reconsideration of the deal is warranted even if the court dismisses this complaint.

The man, who was referred to as \"C\", had killed his ex-girlfriend and her new companion, the court heard. Anonymity was \"necessary\" for his reintegration into the community, the judges ruled. The anonymity issue came about after C, who was released in October, applied for a High Court judicial review of a decision by the home secretary to refuse him unescorted leave in the community. Stephen Knafler QC, appearing for C, accepted that his crimes were \"high up on the scale of horrific\". But he said legal challenges involving mental health patients should be held in private - or at least with the individual's identity protected. Lady Hale, the court's deputy president, described C's crimes as \"horrendous\" and said they had caused \"incalculable distress to the families of the victims\". But she said that without anonymity there was \"a very real risk that the progress he has made during his long years of treatment in hospital would be put in jeopardy and his reintegration in the community, which was an important purpose of his transfer to hospital, will not succeed\". \"I would therefore allow this appeal and maintain the anonymity order in place,\" she said. She also said the public had a right to know what happened in the courts, and that sensible decisions were being made. But that \"right to know\" had to be balanced against the potential harm the disclosure of a patient's identity could cause to the patient \"and perhaps also to the hospital, those treating him and other patients\".

{"article": "Almost none of these will work. Why? Because, on current polling, it all comes down to whether you think the people voting for Andy Burnham or those voting for Yvette Cooper are more likely to put Corbyn as their next preference. And there is no decent publicly available evidence that either of them are. Furthermore, for similar reasons, there is no arithmetic reason why non Corbyn candidates withdrawing would do anything to stop Corbyn. Voters in this election will be given the opportunity to rank the candidates in order of preference. The first preferences are counted up, and the person with the fewest is eliminated from the contest - and the votes they received are given to whoever each person that voted for them rated as their second preference. If after that none of the candidates has achieved 50% of the vote, the candidate with the lowest number of votes is eliminated and their votes are given to whoever they put as their higher preference amongst the two remaining candidates. By definition, this gives one of the two remaining candidates a majority of the votes. Current polling puts Corbyn first, Cooper and Burnham roughly tied in second, and Kendall trailing in third. So either Cooper or Burnham will most likely be the candidate that faces Corbyn in the final round. If you want to stop Corbyn, you'll be voting for some combination of Cooper, Burnham and Kendall as your first three preferences. So your vote WILL end up being for whoever faces Corbyn in the final round, WHICHEVER order you put those three in. The only way you can affect the number of votes Corbyn gets is by trying to second-guess the second preferences of people that vote for eliminated candidates. If you believe the polls, Kendall's almost certain to be eliminated first, so you can't affect that. But one of Burnham and Cooper won't be eliminated before the final run off with Corbyn. Whichever one is eliminated will have their preferences redistributed to either Corbyn or his opponent. So, in theory, if you, the \"stop Corbyn\" voter thought that, say, Burnham's supporters are more likely to have Corbyn as their next preference than Cooper's, you should put Burnham ahead of Cooper in your preference list even if you ACTUALLY prefer Cooper to Burnham - because it'll starve Corbyn of the extra votes he'd get if Burnham was knocked out. The thing is, I am not aware of any decent evidence that this is the case. We have very few polls on the Labour leadership election - and those that exist (necessarily) have small samples of what Burnham and Cooper's second preferences would be. Very roughly speaking, the polling tables I've seen suggest supporters of both split their second preferences about 30/70 between Corbyn and his opponent. So it's not clear which of these you should give a higher preference to tactically stop Corbyn anyway. In other words, there is no obvious way to tactically vote against Corbyn. If you want to stop him he'll be your last preference anyway - and it literally doesn't matter what order your first three preferences are in. Crazy thought though it might be, you can happily vote for candidates on the basis of, y'know, how good you think they are. This actually has implications for people dropping out of the race as well. Ballot papers have already gone out, but Cooper could, for example, tell all her supporters to first preference Andy Burnham instead. In terms of tactical voting, there is NO POINT in any of the three non Corbyn candidates doing this. All their votes will be aggregated to support whoever faces Corbyn in the final round anyway as a result of the preference system. Of course, that's just on the arithmetic. There might be a case for candidates dropping out if they think that a unified anti-Corbyn campaign would be more effective at winning over existing Corbyn supporters - perhaps because they spend less time attacking each other. But this is necessarily pretty speculative, especially this late in the game.

{"article": "Figures show about 57% of closures since September 2006 were in the nine more rural council areas. Conservative education spokesman Darren Millar said Labour was \"letting down\" rural communities with a \"grim record\". Ministers said they were developing plans to ensure rural schools were not \"adversely affected by an over emphasis on surplus places\". Earlier in July, Education Secretary Kirsty Williams told BBC Wales a new law to support rural education could be introduced. An agreement between the Liberal Democrat AM and the Labour First Minister Carwyn Jones included a pledge to look at the impact of current policy on rural schools. According to figures obtained by Mr Millar, using a written question to Ms Williams, 89 out of 157 school closures between the academic years 2006-07 and 2015-16 were in the nine predominantly-rural council areas. Ceredigion shut 20 schools over the period, Powys 18 and Carmarthenshire 17. Mr Millar said: \"It is a scandal that your school is more likely to close if you live in a rural community than if you live in an urban one. \"It's vital that rural Wales gets a better deal from the Welsh Labour-led government in the future and that alternatives to closure, such as schools working together to share staff and resources, are given the chance to work before closure is considered.\" Ms Williams, AM for Brecon and Radnorshire, secured a place in Mr Jones's Labour cabinet based on an agreement which included a promise to review current policy on surplus school places \"with emphasis on rural schools\". Responding to Mr Millar's comments she said ministers were \"committed to reviewing the current policy on surplus school places, with an emphasis on rural schools\". \"This is an opportunity for us to look at the impact of the policy and what that means on the ground in rural areas about the future of education provision. \"We are developing proposals on how we can ensure that schools in rural Wales are not adversely affected by an over emphasis on surplus places.\" There is no single definition of rural Wales, but statisticians have previously defined the nine more rural of the 22 local authorities as Anglesey, Gwynedd, Conwy, Denbighshire, Powys, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire and Monmouthshire.

Some have even said the state's actions amount to ethnic cleansing, and Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel peace laureate, has faced international criticism. Who will help Myanmar's Rohingya? Nobel laureates urge action on Rohingya . The commission, set up by the Myanmar government and led by a former general, Myint Swe, is due to make its final conclusions before the end of January. But, in its interim findings, it dismissed allegations of genocide on the basis that there are still Rohingya Muslims living in Rakhine and that Islamic religious buildings have not been destroyed. It said it had so far found \"insufficient evidence\" that anyone had been raped by security forces, despite widespread claims. Accusations of arson, arbitrary arrest and torture are still being investigated. Strangely, the commission made no mention of the most serious claim - that Burmese security forces have been killing civilians as collective punishment for attacks by Rohingya militants, the BBC's Myanmar correspondent Jonah Fisher reports. Three months since this crisis began, little progress appears to have been made to solve it, he notes. The report says hundreds of Rohingya have been arrested but armed militants are still moving around easily and that looted weapons have yet to be recovered.

The admission that security forces may have carried out abuses is an unusual development, as leaders have previously insisted they are following the rule of law.

They face widespread discrimination and mistreatment. Hundreds of thousands of undocumented Rohingya are estimated to live in Bangladesh, having fled Myanmar over decades. Bangladesh says around 50,000 Rohingya have crossed its border over the past two months. The situation has drawn global condemnation.

He was found guilty of eight sexual assaults on a child under 13 by touching, and six indecent assaults after a trial at Cardiff Crown Court. The court heard Sadiq, of Cyncoed, \"took advantage of his position\". He had denied the charges involving four girls aged between five and 11 and blamed \"politics\" in the mosque for the accusations. But sentencing him, Judge Stephen Hopkins QC told Sadiq: \"Children called you 'uncle' as a mark of respect. You are a man in my judgement of some cunning.\" He added: \"Beneath the veneer there is a dark and deviant side.\" Sadiq, who was a part-time Imam, sexually assaulted two girls under the age of 13 by touching, and indecently assaulted two other girls over a decade between 1996 and 2006 at the Woodville Road mosque. He abused them if they made a mistake while reciting the Koran and would use a stick as a form of punishment in class, hitting people over the hand or hard on the back. Some of his victims said they were afraid to attend the mosque because of his abuse. One said she had attempted to take her own life because of the abuse. In victim impact statements read to the court, others said they felt they could not tell anyone about the abuse because of the culture they grew up in. The court heard one victim feared the consequences of speaking out following Sadiq's conviction. She said: \"Due to my religion it was very difficult, almost impossible to tell anyone what had happened\". She added: \"In the Muslim religion we do not talk about personal matters\". Another victim said it was \"not acceptable\" in her culture to talk about what was happening at the mosque. She said: \"I remember the relief I felt when I told my mother, and she believed me and went to the police. \"In my family honour is very important, but my family have been very supportive\". Sadiq has had no involvement in the mosque since 2006 when it burnt down and was re-sited elsewhere in the city. He was cleared of one indecent assault after his trial last month. In addition to his jail sentence, he was issued with a sexual harm prevention order and will have to register as a sex offender. Det Ch Insp Rob Cronick of South Wales Police praised the \"immense courage\" of the victims who came forward. \"As a result of the verdict and today's sentence I believe there may be members of the community who may now feel confident enough to speak to the police or our support agencies,\" he added.

He caught the Irish flanker high with a swinging arm during Northampton's 37-10 Champions Cup loss and was shown the third red card of his career. The subsequent suspension took the total number of weeks he has been unavailable during his career to 60. Hartley will not have played for nine weeks before England's opening game against France on 4 February at Twickenham. When the captain was asked if he had changed his game in response to his latest sanction, Jones interrupted: \"He's had 60 weeks off mate, he's a world expert.\" The Australian added: \"I think he's ready. He trained well on Tuesday and has still got a couple of days to go. We're pleased to have him back. It's the continuity of the job.\" Hartley, when asked about his suitability for the role, said: \"We did this last year, talking about me. I'm confident, I feel fresh, I feel fit, and focused. \"I'm here on behalf of the team. The challenge is to use this week as best we can to get the preparation right for a huge first game.\" Hartley was dropped from England's 2015 Rugby World Cup squad after he headbutted Saracens' Jamie George, but was recalled by Jones after he replaced Stuart Lancaster. The hooker went on to lead the side to a Six Nations Grand Slam as they embarked on a run of 14 consecutive Test match victories. British and Irish Lions coach Warren Gatland has refused to be drawn on whether Hartley's disciplinary record will affect his chances of leading this summer's tour to New Zealand. Media playback is not supported on this device . Jones attended the launch with a dressing on his face and a black eye, caused by a fall in the bathroom of his hotel. However, the Australian did initially suggest he suffered the injury while attempting the combat sports England players have been practising since October. \"First we had judo and then we had MMA, so we're just going through all the martial arts sports to see what effect they have on the body,\" Jones said. \"My mother always told me I've got to shave and I forgot, so I walked out of the shower to get the shaver and this is what happened.\" Back row James Haskell has been given the all-clear to link up with the squad after recovering from a foot injury that kept him out for six months.

{"article": "Juliano Pinto, a 29-year-old with complete paralysis of the lower trunk, performed the symbolic kick-off at the Corinthians Arena in Sao Paulo. Using his robotic suit, Mr Pinto kicked the official ball a short distance along a mat laid down by the touchline. But some observers argued the historic event was not given the attention it deserved during the opening ceremony. The identity of the young volunteer was kept a secret until after the event. His robotic exoskeleton was created by a team of more than 150 researchers led by Brazilian neuroscientist Dr Miguel Nicolelis. Dr Nicolelis tweeted called the event a \"great team effort\" and afterwards tweeted: \"We did it!!!\" \"It was up to Juliano to wear the exoskeleton, but all of them made that shot. It was a big score by these people and by our science,\" he commented. The neuroscientist, who is based at Duke University in the US, is a leading figure in the field of brain-machine interfaces. In breakthrough work published in 2003, he showed that monkeys could control the movement of virtual arms on an avatar using just their brain activity. The scientists have been working under the banner of a consortium called the Walk Again Project. In a statement, the consortium said the World Cup demonstration would be \"just the beginning\" of a future \"in which people with paralysis may abandon the wheelchair and literally walk again\". But some TV networks didn't capture the event, prompting criticism on Twitter. Some commentators also took aim at ceremony organisers for apparently sidelining the moment in favour of performing acts. Dr Nicolelis had been training eight patients at his lab in Sao Paulo, all of whom were over 20 years of age, with the oldest about 35. \"It's the first time an exoskeleton has been controlled by brain activity and offered feedback to the patients,\" Dr Nicolelis, a neuroscientist at Duke University, told the AFP news agency . \"Doing a demonstration in a stadium is something very much outside our routine in robotics. It's never been done before.\" The exoskeleton uses a cap placed on the patient's head to pick up brain signals and relay them to a computer in the exoskeleton's backpack. This then decodes the signals and sends them to the legs. The robotic suit is powered by hydraulics, and a battery in the backpack allows for approximately two hours of use. \"The basic idea is that we are recording from the brain and then that signal is being translated into commands for the robot to start moving,\" Dr Gordon Cheng, at the Technical University of Munich, who is a member of the team, told the BBC in May. Dr Cheng led the development of a form of artificial skin for the exoskeleton. This skin consists of flexible printed circuit boards, each containing pressure, temperature and speed sensors. It is applied on the soles of the feet and allows the patient to receive tactile stimulation when walking with the exoskeleton. When the robotic suit starts to move and touches the ground, signals are transmitted to an electronic vibration device on the patient's arm, which stimulates their skin. After lots of practice, the brain starts associating the movements of the legs with the vibration in the arm. In theory, the patient should start to develop the sensation that they have legs and that they are walking.

{"article": "The pontiff called for reconciliation as he addressed the Friendship Stadium in Cotonou, Benin's main city in the heartland of the Voodoo religion. The 84-year-old handed over a document showing how doctrine in the Roman Catholic church could heal rifts. The liturgy was delivered in at least 10 African languages and also broadcast in St Peter's Square, Vatican City. Many in the crowd dressed in colourful robes emblazoned with the Pope's image, and some of those who had not made it inside, kneeled and prayed in the car park. The Pontiff urged them \"to be attentive to the cry of the poor, the weak and the outcast\" as well as \"those affected by Aids or other illnesses\". His spiritual vision for Africa - contained in a formal treatise - has been called a \"papal road map\" for the continent. It applies doctrines like turning the other cheek and forgiveness to try to address the conflicts in Africa, such as those fuelled by ethnic divisions. By Virgile AhissouBBC Afrique, Cotonou . Voodoo is recognised as an official religion in Benin, followed by some 40% of the population. People across West Africa, especially Togo, Ghana and Nigeria hold similar beliefs. Voodoo has none of the negative connotations it has in the West and many of those who are officially Christian or Muslim also incorporate some Voodoo elements into their beliefs, especially in times of crisis. But Voodoo is more than a belief system, it is a complete way of life, including culture, philosophy, language, art, dance, music and medicine. Voodoo priests ask the gods to intervene on behalf of ordinary people but local adherents stress that they have nothing to do with sorcery or black magic. People here do not stick needles into dolls to cause misfortune to their enemies, as you see in some Western films. It also calls for good governance and the abolition of the death penalty, and condemns abuse of women and children. The document was drawn up two years ago at a meeting in Rome by Catholic bishops from all over Africa. Witchcraft warning . On Saturday, the second day of his visit to Benin, the Pope travelled to the city of Ouidah where he called for respect for traditional beliefs but also issued a warning against witchcraft. Voodoo is widely practised in Benin, where it has none of the negative connotations often associated with it in Western countries. The Pope's first public engagement on Friday was at the presidential palace in Cotonou, where he again issued an appeal for reconciliation in front of politicians, diplomats and Church figures.

{"article": "The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is believed to have deployed about 30,000 fighters. US-led coalition warplanes will support the offensive and Russia has also given its backing. The SDF did not mention any plan to take Raqqa, the de facto capital of the \"caliphate\" proclaimed by IS in 2014. The alliance, which is dominated by the Kurdish Popular Protection Units (YPG) militia, has emerged as a key ally of the US-led coalition over the past two years, leading the fight against IS on the ground in northern Syria. With the help of US airpower, it has taken control of about 26,000 sq km (10,000 sq miles) of territory, including a 400km (250 mile) stretch along the Turkish border. On Tuesday, SDF fighters were seen moving south from Tal Abyad near the Turkish border towards Ain Issa, a town about 60km (37 miles) north-west of Raqqa, according to UK-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Clashes were reported nearby, it added. SDF commander Rojda Felat wrote on Twitter that the goal of the new offensive was to \"liberate northern Raqqa\" and those living under IS \"oppression\". \"The campaign is aimed at repelling terrorist attacks on Shaddadi, Tal Abyad and Kobane, ensuring the security of our people,\" she added. An SDF source told the Kurdish news agency, Rudaw, that fighters would be \"advancing to the villages of Big Fatiseh, Small Fatiseh and Tishi, in order to clear them of [IS] militants first\". BBC Middle East Correspondent Quentin Sommerville says IS fighters are digging in, ready for the assault. As well as defensive placements in Raqqa, they have constructed an extensive network of tunnels, he adds. A Baghdad-based spokesman for the US-led coalition, Col Steve Warren, said the SDF operation was aimed at \"putting pressure on Raqqa\", but not taking the city. The SDF fighters had so far met little resistance, he added. The anti-IS activist group, Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently (RBSS), reported that there had been air strikes on IS positions north of Raqqa on Tuesday, and that intense fighting had erupted around the village of Heisha. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov also said that Moscow was ready to co-ordinate with the SDF and the US on the offensive. The SDF's announcement followed a meeting between officials in the alliance and a top US commander in northern Syria on Saturday. Gen Joseph Votel, head of US Central Command, made the secret trip to check on the 200 US military personnel who were advising the SDF on the ground. The US wants to increase the number of Arab fighters in the SDF, which currently consists of at least 25,000 Kurds and between 5,000 and 6,000 Arabs, before trying to retake Raqqa. Col Warren said about 3,000 to 5,000 IS fighters were inside Raqqa. IS seized the city in August 2013, five months after it became the first Syrian provincial capital to fall to rebel forces seeking to topple President Bashar al-Assad.

{"article": "On Friday, we saw signs of what shape such a shift may take. In a post on the platform he runs, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman suggested the technology industry - and the complex spider's web of relationships within it - needs to agree on what he's called a Decency Pledge, a code of conduct most would consider to just be responsible, professional behaviour, but in the technology business apparently needs to be hammered home. Mr Hoffman's post - which I'll go into more detail about in a moment - followed a damning report published on Thursday by The Information - a subscription-only tech news service. It shared details alleging several instances of sexual harassment by a prominent venture capitalist, Justin Caldbeck, who by Friday afternoon had taken a leave of absence from Binary Capital, where he is/was a managing partner. The Information quoted several women, some of whom chose to make their identities public - a stance not often taken in this industry, but one buoyed by the efforts of Susan Fowler, the former Uber employee who blogged about her treatment at the firm, kicking off Uber's torrid phase. From the report: \"The women who made the allegations include Niniane Wang, who co-created Google Desktop and served as CTO of Minted, and Susan Ho and Leiti Hsu, co-founders of Journy, a travel planning and booking service. \"Ms Wang alleges Mr Caldbeck, while informally trying to recruit her for a tech company job, tried to sleep with her. \"Ms Ho said that Mr Caldbeck, while discussing investing in their start-up, sent her text messages in the middle of the night suggesting they meet up. Ms Hsu says that Mr Caldbeck groped her under a table at a Manhattan hotel bar.\" Mr Caldbeck responded to the allegations on Friday afternoon. \"The past 24 hours have been the darkest of my life,\" he said in a statement first reported by Axios. \"I have made many mistakes over the course of my career, some of which were brought to light this week. To say I'm sorry about my behaviour is a categorical understatement. Still, I need to say it: I am so, so sorry.\" He said he apologised for contributing to a \"gender hostile\" environment. \"The power dynamic that exists in venture capital is despicably unfair,\" he continued. \"The gap of influence between male venture capitalists and female entrepreneurs is frightening and I hate that my behaviour played a role in perpetrating a gender-hostile environment. It is outrageous and unethical for any person to leverage a position of power in exchange for sexual gain, it is clear to me now that that is exactly what I've done.\" Unlike Uber, a service used by millions around the world, the allegations against Mr Caldbeck will not generate many headlines. While well-known among the movers of Silicon Valley, like many big-time investors here, Mr Caldbeck operates in a world the majority of the public don't get to see. But the ramifications of this fall from grace, coming as it does so soon after the Uber scandal, point to a bigger picture in which those previously worried to speak out are deciding that it's a risk worth taking. But LinkedIn's Mr Hoffman points out that preventing abuses of power between investors and those eager for their money - but not sexual advances - is difficult. Unlike a manager-employee relationship within a company, where good firms can use thorough HR measures to prevent abuse, these are interactions happening between people from separate firms, and one where the balance of power is tipped heavily in one direction. In other words, there is no way to \"refer up\" a complaint - other than going to the press, a terrifying and potentially career-limiting approach. \"I think the industry should actively work on building a kind of industry-wide HR function,\" Mr Hoffman writes. \"So that venture capitalists who engage in such behaviour face the same sort of consequences that they would if their overtures were directed at an employee.\" ___________ .

{"article": "Journalist Ben Jacobs tweeted that Mr Gianforte had \"body slammed\" him, breaking his glasses. The front runner's campaign said that Mr Jacobs had initiated the incident by grabbing Mr Gianforte's wrist. But other journalists said they saw the reporter show no physical aggression. The incident took place on Wednesday, the eve of a special election to fill a vacant seat in the House of Representatives. The Guardian released an audio recording of the clash, in which crashing sounds can be heard when Mr Jacobs presses the candidate for a response to a question. Mr Gianforte then shouts \"I'm sick and tired of you guys\" and tells the reporter to \"get the hell out of here\". Alicia Acuna of Fox News was in the room with two colleagues preparing for a television interview with Mr Gianforte at the time. She said Mr Jacobs entered the room, put a voice recorder up to Mr Gianforte's face and asked about the Congressional Budget Office report on the American Health Care Act. When Mr Jacobs persisted, \"Gianforte grabbed Jacobs by the neck with both hands and slammed him into the ground behind him\", she wrote. \"Faith, Keith and I watched in disbelief as Gianforte then began punching the reporter. As Gianforte moved on top of Jacobs, he began yelling something to the effect of, \"I'm sick and tired of this!\", she added. \"At no point did any of us who witnessed this assault see Jacobs show any form of physical aggression toward Gianforte,\" she said. Mr Jacobs later told MSNBC he then went to a hospital to have his elbow X-rayed, because he landed on it during the incident. He said he believed the campaign staff were unhappy about previous dealings with Guardian colleagues. Three of the state's largest newspapers, the Billings Gazette, the Helena Independent Record, and the Missoulian, have since their endorsements of Mr Gianforte. \"We are also sick and tired - of Gianforte's incessant attacks on the free press,\" said the Independent Record. The Missoulian noted that as the eyewitness report came from right-wing Fox News, the incident could not be construed as liberal \"fake news\". Mr Gianforte's campaign spokesman said Mr Jacobs entered the office without permission and \"aggressively shoved a recorder in Greg's face and began asking badgering questions\".

A spokesman said \"restrictive abortion laws\" on the island are forcing women to order pills over the internet. Anti-abortion campaigners have dismissed the helpline launch as a \"dangerous publicity stunt\". Although abortion it is not currently illegal on the island, the law states the procedure can only be carried out in the event of a criminal offence or on mental health grounds. According to the UK Department of Health, 105 women travelled from the Isle of Man to England in 2015 to terminate pregnancies. However, while most women from the UK can have an NHS-funded abortion, those from the island have to pay for both the procedure and travel expenses.

Mr Fowle, 56, entered North Korea on 29 April and was detained in early June as he was leaving the country. He was charged with \"anti-state\" crimes.

The archives also show UK Treasury concern at overfunding of Scotland and Northern Ireland under the Barnett formula, a political issue to this day. In the mid-1980s, Wales secured one fifth of inward investment into the UK despite having only 5% of the population. But with the then Conservative government trying to cut public spending, the Treasury tried to cut back regional spending in England. That could have hit the Welsh Office budget and the secretary of state Nicholas Edwards joined his Scottish counterpart George Younger to protest. In a letter to the Treasury chief secretary (and fellow Welshman) Peter Rees - copied to the prime minister - Mr Edwards complained about the implications for his budget. He wrote: \"I agree strongly with the points George Younger has made in his letter. They apply equally in the three territories. The political effects in Wales, as in Scotland, would be most damaging.\" Mr Edwards demanded to be present at meetings between the Treasury and Department for Trade and Industry when the issue was discussed. The archives do not record any reply and Mr Edwards - now Lord Crickhowell - cannot recall the episode. But, in another parallel with today's politics, the archives show Treasury concern at overfunding of Scotland and Northern Ireland under the so-called Barnett formula that is also used to calculate changes in the Welsh budget. Peter Rees, later Lord Rees of Goytre, wrote to Mrs Thatcher: \"Even our predecessors never saw it as any more than a stop-gap arrangement on the road to political devolution, certainly not as the permanency it has now become. \"Be that as it may, the block system is now publicly construed, in the territories, as apolitical entitlement to public expenditure. The longer we let it run the harder it becomes to challenge that perception, and the greater the risk of political repercussion when we do. \" MP David Willetts, then a Downing Street adviser, wrote: \"Scotland and NI have their snouts well and truly in the public expenditure trough. The challenge is to find a politically acceptable way of putting them on the same diet as the English.\" The files reveal that the Treasury considered suspending the formula. Mr Rees wrote to Mrs Thatcher: \"The 'fallback' approach to securing savings is to suspend the operation of the comparability formulae for the Scottish and Northern Ireland blocks - though not for Wales, where over-provision is not suspected.\" Thirty years on, the UK political parties have vowed to keep the formula as part of a deal to keep Scotland in the United Kingdom. Mrs Thatcher's ministers considered launching the controversial poll tax in Wales before England, according to other files just released. The documents released by the National Archives also show Conservative government advisers feared a repeat of the 1984-85 miners' strike the following winter.

{"article": "\"Hairy Nose\" depicts a bleak future where people have evolved lengthy nasal hair to filter out the smog. It ends with a warning that if people don't change their ways, pollution will change them. The charity, WildAid, told the BBC they wanted people to stop waiting for government action to fix the problem. \"We wanted to find some humorous way to talk about the very serious problem we are facing,\" said WildAid's China representative, May Mei. Hairy Nose shows a parade of stylish Chinese people - and one dog - sporting elaborately groomed nasal hair as they go about their daily lives in the \"putrid, choking air and the never ending smog\". We see a a young family out with their hairy-nosed baby, a young commuter with her nasal hair dyed and plaited, hipsters playing pool and a couple on a date. \"To them, this is just the way it is,\" say the captions. But one man decides not to \"blindly submit\" and shaves off his nose hair so he can breathe, \"because it reminds me that the sky once was blue\". \"Change air pollution before it changes you,\" says the final caption. Ms Mei said WildAid wanted to tell people to stop waiting for the government to take action on pollution and climate change, and instead come up with their own creative ways to be more green. \"A lot of people complain about pollution in Beijing and Shanghai, but no-one really knows what you can do,\" she said. \"What we want to say is that change is not that difficult, it should come from everyone.\" She suggested that 35% of Beijing's pollution comes from transport fumes, so cycling or walking would make a real difference. The campaign is targeting mostly young Chinese, particularly internet users, because they are \"willing to change, to accept new ideas and are also prepared for something better\". China, which is reliant on coal-fuelled power stations, is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Pollution levels in major cities routinely reach levels considered dangerous to human health. A report last year, published in Nature, put the number of annual deaths in China attributable to pollution at 1.3 million. WildAid clearly doesn't expect people to take its hairy nose warning literally, but Ms Mei said they hoped it would make people \"think harder\". \"If you're waiting to change your actions, you will eventually be forced to live not in the way you want,\" she said.", "abstract": "Air pollution in China is no laughing matter, but one campaign group hopes its bizarre new film will provoke both laughs and action among urban Chinese.", "candidate": "A global environmental charity has launched a social media campaign in China aimed at highlighting the issue of air pollution.", "doc_id": 2841, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "The campaign is targeting mostly young Chinese, particularly internet users, because they are \"willing to change, to accept new ideas and are also prepared for something better\".", "explanation": "Accurate that it was launched because of pollution and to bring awareness to the young people in China.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

US rock band Foo Fighters were due to headline on Friday, but were forced to pull out after frontman Dave Grohl broke his leg.

I'll do anything I can to help them out.\" Organisers have not yet announced who will fill the vacant slot below Florence on Friday.

The suggestion from the chief executive of the Ulster-Scots Agency, Ian Crozier, to the head of languages at the Department of Communities, proposes an additional \u00c2\u00a3140m in funding for Ulster-Scots culture. Mr Crozier is a former special adviser to DUP MP Nigel Dodds and remains a member of the party, according to the News Letter. His paper outlined his belief that \"the Ulster-Scots community is facing discrimination\" and that the Irish language receives 10 times more funding than all Ulster-Scots culture combined. Staying with politics, the News Letter reports that the DUP South Antrim MP Sammy Wilson is \"fed up\" with MLAs \"gurning\", which is, incidentally, Ulster-Scots for complaining. His remarks come as a complaint against his DUP colleague Edwin Poots for allegedly breaching the Northern Ireland assembly's code of conduct was dismissed. \"Why can they not just be grown up and accept that, look, in the rough-and-tumble of politics, people will say things you don't like, and you just have to live with it, rather than running to granda or daddy to reprimand people you don't like,\" Mr Wilson said. \"Hero policeman dies in Thailand,\" is the front page headline in the Belfast Telegraph, the story billed as exclusive. 50-year-old Heath Taylor died in what the paper describe as a \"freak accident\".

{"article": "The Intercontinental Cup loss drops Ireland from first to second in the table with two matches to go, Ireland next playing the Netherlands in August. The winner of the group will play off against the lowest ranked Test side (currently Zimbabwe) in 2018 for full status. The three-day loss is only Ireland's third in the 13-year history of the tournament. Resuming their first innings on 170-7 - still 367 runs in arrears - John Anderson showed the necessary application as he scored an unbeaten 61 from 175 balls. He has now passed the 50 mark in all five matches he has played in the competition. He received admirable support from the tail, sharing stands of 43 with Andrew McBrine (18) for the eighth wicket and 41 for the last with Peter Chase (18) as Ireland added 91 to their overnight total. The determination with which the Irish tail had resisted Afghanistan and leg-spinner Rashid Khan - who failed to add to his five-wicket tally - offered hope the Irish could mount a spirited resistance with the bat.

{"article": "It is a relationship that these days may be closer to a case of gritting one's teeth rather than a smile, at least when it comes to trade. As it is for most countries in Asia, China is North Korea's biggest trading partner. Except that of course that there's one major difference: North Korea would completely collapse without China's economic help. That's why the US has been persuading Beijing to help the international community ensure that the new round of sanctions would hit North Korea where it hurts - cutting off access to Pyongyang's biggest customer is one way to send a powerful message. The latest sanctions - imposed because of North Korea's nuclear programme - aims to cut its coal exports to China by 60%. But there have been international sanctions and censure in place before, and despite those measures, China has continued to buy products from North Korea. Chinese companies buy North Korean coal and textiles, for example, while at the same time selling food, arms and energy to Pyongyang. Partly this is out of an allegiance to an old but volatile ally, but also partly out of a desire to ensure the balance of power in the region is tipped in Beijing's favour. Many analysts say China's refusal to play ball means that the sanctions strategy isn't working. But as Gordon Chang, author of \"The Coming Collapse of China\" tells me, it's not that the sanctions on North Korea haven't been working - \"it's that China doesn't get punished when it doesn't implement the sanctions\". While it's true that in recent years China hasn't been particularly strict about enforcing sanctions on North Korea, there's some evidence to show that trade between the two neighbours is slowing. China's trade with North Korea has been falling this year, some 13% from a year earlier according to data in May from the Korea International Trade Association. Exports were down 15.6%, while Beijing's imports fell by 9.8%. But Mr Chang points out that this is as much about the slowing of China's economy as it is about sanctions. \"Demand for commodities has slowed, and China is buying less of everything,\" he said. \"And it's not that big a sacrifice for China - it doesn't really need this coal anyway.\" In an article for the Conversation website, Kelvin Gray of the University of Sussex said that even if coal exports fall \"one area where North Korea has kept its exports [to China] healthy is clothing\". Machines and raw materials are sold to North Korea from a Chinese company, the North Koreans provide the labour, (probably for a fraction of the price it would cost in China) and then the finished goods end up back in China. The profits that the North Korean regime makes from this sort of trade is difficult to calculate - but it is almost certainly in the hundreds of millions. It's a relationship that Beijing is unlikely to sever - and not for the usual argument that you hear about North Korean refugees flooding the Chinese border should the state collapse - at least, not according to Mr Chang. \"The first place North Koreans would go if the country were to collapse wouldn't be China, it would be South Korea,\" he said. \"The real reason why China keeps the North Korean state alive economically is because it whenever Pyongyang fires off another test, Washington comes running to Beijing for help.\" Mr Chang adds that this is a position China likes and wants to keep. And, he says, that unless Washington starts punishing Beijing for not enforcing these rules, this round of sanctions is unlikely to have much of an effect either.", "abstract": "There's a famous saying attributed to the founder of the Chinese Communist Party, Mao Zedong, that China and North Korea are as close as \"lips are to teeth\".", "candidate": "The relationship between China and North Korea is one of the closest in the world.", "doc_id": 2844, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "As it is for most countries in Asia, China is North Korea's biggest trading partner.", "explanation": "They would have to be close to be the biggest trading partner.

Average weekly earnings increased by 2.1% compared with a year earlier - slightly higher than last month's 2% increase. But with inflation standing at 2.6%, real earnings still fell by 0.5%, the ONS figures showed. At 75.1%, the proportion of people in work is the highest it has been since 1971 - partly due to the introduction of a later state pension age for women.

Read more from Andy here . Jobs were created in the construction, accommodation and food services sectors and transport and storage industries. Pay rises improved, up by 2.1% (excluding bonuses) compared with a consensus prediction of 2%. The increase prompted some economists to suggest that wages may finally be responding to an economy which is closing in on full employment. It remains, however, a long way short of what would be required to trigger the sort of wage-price spiral about which central bankers have been hyper-vigilant since the 1970s. That employees are prepared to accept wages that shrink by a tiny bit less than they did the last time these figures came out does not exactly bespeak a dramatic new assertion of workers' bargaining power. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics said the figures gave some signs that the tighter labour market was leading to a recovery in wage growth. \"Inflation is likely to fall back next year as the impact of the drop in the pound dwindles. What's more, the tightness of the labour market should deliver further rises in nominal wage growth over the coming quarters,\" she said. The pound rose rose against both the dollar and the euro following the positive news on jobs, recovering some of the ground lost on Tuesday, before losing most of those gains. However, productivity - or output per worker - continued to decline, the ONS said, issuing preliminary figures for the second quarter. Productivity was 0.1% lower than in the first quarter and \"remains at around the same level as its pre-downturn peak\".

{"article": "Official data do not include emissions from making imported goods but both sets of researchers say they should. The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports 26% of global emissions come from producing goods for trade. The Carbon Trust found such \"embedded\" CO2 could negate domestic carbon cuts planned in the UK up to 2025. Researchers want all nations to publish their data on embedded emissions. Glen Peters of research group Cicero, lead authors of the PNAS report, told BBC News: \"There is a degree of delusion about emissions cuts in developed nations. They are not really cuts at all if countries are simply buying in products they used to manufacture. \"We really need all countries to be developing and publishing the full extent of their emissions, whether they are produced domestically or outsourced through traded goods.\" The issue of embedded (or outsourced) carbon emissions has been recognised for several years, and the methodology to track emissions pathways is developing. Cicero produced a trade-linked global database for CO2 emissions covering 113 countries and 57 economic sectors from 1990 to 2008. It found that emissions from producing exported goods increased from 4.3Gt (gigatonnes) of CO2 in 1990 (20% of global emissions) to 7.8Gt of CO2 in 2008 (26%). Most developed countries increased their consumption-based emissions faster than their territorial emissions - particularly from goods such cars and clothes. The Carbon Trust research confirms that the UK has increased emissions since 1990 rather than decreasing them, as politicians typically claim. What may alarm ministers even more is a projection that the radical CO2 cuts planned by government into the 2020s may be offset by ever-increasing levels of CO2 in imports. Dr Peters said: \"Publishing this sort of data is the first step. The next step - what to do about it - is more difficult. \"It raises questions about consumption patterns, and whether countries should consider border taxes on imports from countries with no controls on CO2 emissions\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 though this is controversial and will be some way down the line.\" A UK think tank, the Public Interest Research Centre (Pirc), has been discovering how uncomfortable this issue is proving for rich nations. A succession of Freedom of Information requests reveals a degree of frustration among some British civil servants that the UK insists on basing its emissions calculations solely on domestic emissions. One piece of government correspondence reveals: \"While technological efficiency has improved the CO2 impacts of our products since 1992, the rise in UK consumption has outstripped the improvements achieved. \"The government needs to be cautious about over-claiming on its achievements in decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation.\" Ministers are well aware of the issue, but insist that the UK should stick to reporting domestic emissions, as these form the basis for international climate negotiations. They also point out that emissions data from major exporters like China is notoriously opaque, and that the methodology for calculating outsourced emissions is unreliable. They say all this creates even greater pressure for the UK to persuade China to cut its own emissions. Guy Shrubsole, from Pirc, told BBC News: \"This is a cop-out. The figures aren't perfect but the problem has been recognised for several years and the calculations are getting better all the time. In the UK our emissions are up - not down. \"Of course China needs to be part of a global climate agreement.

Housing applications in the area had been judged acceptable against the borough's planning policies, drawn up following a statutory process including consultation, it said. Caravans arrived on the Berkshire site on 24 April with the permission of the landowner, who is part of the gypsy community. But the council has taken legal action because developments that have since taken place do not have planning consent. It obtained the injunction to prevent further caravans and development on the Berkshire site, after its deadline to exit the site by Monday 27 April was ignored. \"This is not a site allocated for development in the council's local plan,\" said director of environment, Helen Thwaites. \"It is located within the countryside where the council's policies seek to protect the rural character.\" Residents near the site, in Blagrove Lane, have also expressed concern.

{"article": "The 49-year-old Colorado native, whose legal pedigree includes Harvard and Oxford, would succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia if confirmed. He is favoured by many conservatives who consider him to espouse a similarly strict interpretation of law as Scalia. Judge Gorsuch was first nominated to the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals by former President George W Bush in 2006. Judge Gorsuch began his law career clerking for Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, the latter of whom he could now serve alongside. He worked in a private law practice in Washington for a decade and served as the principal deputy assistant associate attorney general at the Justice Department under the Bush administration. Judge Gorsuch graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where former President Barack Obama was a classmate, and earned a doctorate in legal philosophy at Oxford University. Perhaps it was during his time in England that he accumulated what his former law partner, Mark Hansen, has said was \"an inexhaustible store\" of Winston Churchill quotes. Judge Gorsuch - who reportedly likes to fly-fish and hunt - lives in Boulder with his wife Louise and two daughters, where he is also an adjunct law professor at the University of Colorado. If confirmed by the Senate, he would become the only Protestant on the current bench. The other justices are Jewish and Catholic. His family is well-connected in Republican establishment politics. His mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, was the first female director of the Environmental Protection Agency during the Reagan administration. He is known for his clear and concise writing style, navigating the most complex legal issues as deftly as the double-black diamond slopes on which he is reputedly an expert skier in the snow-capped mountain state he calls home. Judge Gorsuch's published writings reveal his conservative leanings. He argued against euthanasia in his 2006 book The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia. \"All human beings are intrinsically valuable and the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong,\" he wrote. In a 2005 article in the National Review, Judge Gorsuch argued that \"American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom\". He said they keep \"relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda\". Judge Gorsuch has never ruled on abortion, and he is not expected to call into question high-profile rulings on that issue or gay marriage. His conservative outlook cements Mr Trump's campaign promise to nominate a judge \"in the mould\" of Justice Scalia, restoring the nine-seat high court's 5-4 conservative majority. Much like the late Scalia, the Ivy-League educated judge is known to support textualism, or the interpretation of law according to its plain text. He also maintains a strict interpretation of the US Constitution, or how it was originally understood by the Founding Fathers. While sitting on the bench of the 10th Circuit, Judge Gorsuch sided with groups that successfully challenged the Obama administration's requirements for employers to provide health insurance that includes contraception in the Hobby Lobby Stores v Sebelius case. Judge Gorsuch has also expressed concern about \"executive overreach\", a criticism that was often directed at the Obama administration's use of presidential orders to overcome congressional gridlock. He has sharply questioned a landmark Supreme Court ruling determining that courts should defer to government agencies when it comes to interpretations of ambiguous federal laws. Conservatives blame the 1984 decision involving the Chevron oil company for handing too much power to the regulatory state. In an August 2016 concurring opinion, Judge Gorsuch wrote that \"executive bureaucracies [were being allowed] to swallow huge amounts of core judicial and legislative power and concentrate federal power in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers' design\".

He asked what was more credible: \"The views of one individual who will have his own motivations, or the views of the vast majority of party members who have publicly come out and given their support to Arlene Foster. \"I think that I am maybe in a better position than David McIlveen to make an assessment of the view within the party.\" However, Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt said Mr McIlveen's intervention was \"significant\". \"I know you were reporting it as David McIlveen breaking ranks and that is true, but equally true is that he is joining the ranks of those pointing the finger of blame,\" he said. \"And we're not talking about bit players here, David McIlveen was an assembly private secretary for Arlene Foster, he's joining Jonathan Bell who was a junior minister and also a minister for the department of enterprise.\" Mr McIlveen also criticised Mrs Foster's treatment of Jonathan Bell, who in December, made a series of allegations about the DUP's involvement in the scheme. \"When one of her own party members broke rank to express their concern about the scheme, rather than approach the issues raised with a listening ear, the default position was to attack the personal integrity of the individual raising the concerns,\" he wrote. \"In any other context, Jonathan Bell MLA would be called a whistleblower. \"Upon witnessing the way in which he was treated by the leadership of the party I do not see how any member of the public who sees something going wrong in the civil service would feel inspired to raise issues with a DUP-run department, upon witnessing how their own people are treated.\" Last month, Mrs Foster said she had \"felt intimidated by Jonathan Bell\" during an RHI meeting, claiming he had \"used his physical bulk to stand over me in quite an aggressive way\". Mr Bell had claimed that Mrs Foster was verbally \"abusive\" and angrily \"overruled\" him when he tried to close the scheme. Mr McIlveen also criticised Mrs Foster for branding some of her RHI critics as \"misogynist\", saying that \"rather than facing critics on the level of their political arguments yet again it descends to the personal\".

Ifab are keen to reach a decision in principle at Friday's gathering. \"The captain should be more than somebody who has a piece of material on their arm,\" Ifab technical director David Elleray told BBC Sport. \"Can we consult them more about how the game should be played? Should we encourage much better relationships between the captains and players? Should the captain also bear more responsibility?\" Former Premier League referee Elleray believes the measures may stop players crowding around referees, as only the captain would have the authority to talk to officials after what he describes as \"major incidents\". \"If that stops six players from each team going to talk the referee that will enhance respect and improve respect for the game,\" he said. \"When I was refereeing, sometimes you could say to a captain 'have a word with Freddy because he's getting quite close to a yellow card' and he could calm him down. \"You could explain decisions to a good captain and he could pass that on.\" Elleray confirmed that discussions have already taken place with an expert panel of players, coaches and referees and that there is widespread support for the plans. Other items on the agenda include a proposal to introduce sin-bins for yellow-card offences. The measure has been tested in Uefa development competitions and some amateur leagues in recent years. If approved, sin-bins will come in at youth and amateur levels and could be introduced to the professional game within two to three years. Ifab will also talk about allowing national associations more freedom to decide on the number of substitutions in a game. The move is intended to help the development of the game at lower levels, \"by promoting and encouraging more people to take part\".

{"article": "The first group stages of the women's tournament take place on Wednesday - so-called day -2 - with Sweden facing South Africa, while the men's group stages start on Thursday, when Iraq play Denmark (both 17:00 BST). Here's all you need to know. It's simply for scheduling reasons, as it was at London 2012. With 16 men's and 12 women's teams, there are 58 matches to get through. There is football being played on 12 days of the tournament, with six rest days. Men's groups . Women's groups . Barcelona forward Neymar will captain a Brazil squad aiming to win its first Olympic gold medal. The hosts also have Lazio midfielder Felipe Anderson in their squad along with Neymar's Barca team-mate Rafinha and Paris Saint-Germain defender Marquinhos. Meanwhile, Tottenham forward Son Heung-min will represent South Korea and Chelsea's John Mikel Obi brings experience for Nigeria. Five-time women's world player of the year Marta competes in her fourth Olympics for Brazil, while her 38-year-old team-mate Formiga is going to her sixth Games and is looking to continue her streak of appearing at every women's Olympic football tournament. The reigning world and Olympic champions USA have seven gold medal winners in their line-up. Among them is goalkeeper Hope Solo, who could win a record fourth Olympic title at Rio, and current world player of the year Carli Lloyd. Team GB fielded men's and women's teams at London 2012, with both sides knocked out at the quarter-final stage. The English Football Association had hoped to have both teams in Rio, but they failed to gain support from the other home nations and Fifa was not willing to accept a Great Britain team without players from every one of the home nations. Qualification is also based on tournament results and while England's women would have earned their place by finishing third at last year's World Cup, the men's failure to get past the group stage of the European Under-21 Championships would have denied them. Team GB qualification is based on England's results because the English FA is the national governing body on the BOA. \"I'm really disappointed that these next set of players won't have that opportunity in Rio,\" said former England striker Kelly Smith, who was part of Team GB's 18-strong squad at London. \"It's a great experience and you get to play against the best teams and players from across the world. It's disheartening they couldn't get a side together. The Americans view this as the ultimate.\" Even though it was not included in the Olympic programme until 1996, the women's competition is often seen as more prestigious than the men's, which is age-restricted (only three men in each squad can be over 23). For many Brazilians, the men's football tournament will be the most important part of the Games - especially on home soil, where they are looking to win their first ever gold medal in the sport. Hosts Brazil are the firm favourites to take the men's title after the disappointment of losing in the final at London 2012. Defending champions Mexico could prove a difficult opponent again, while Germany also have a strong team. In the women's event, the USA won gold in 2012 and the World Cup last year, while the European trio of France, Germany and Sweden will also be strong.

The SMC approved the drug after hearing that patients tended to be younger women with family and work commitments.

Olaparib is already approved for use in England for people who are suffering with cancer for a third time. In Scotland, it will be used by women who have relapsed with cancer for a second time. Katherine Taylor, chief executive of research charity Ovarian Cancer Action, said: \"The SMC's decision to approve the routine use of olaparib is ground-breaking; a huge leap towards more personalised treatment for women facing ovarian cancer because of a genetic mutation.\" The drug targets ovarian cancer in women with a BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 gene mutation.

Ms Taylor warned that women in Scotland would only qualify for olaparib if their BRCA status is known. She said: \"NHS Scotland must continue to make sure that all patients are offered a BRCA test at diagnosis so they can be treated with the best drugs available.\" Gregor McNie, of Cancer Research UK in Scotland, said the charity was also funding clinical trials to asses the potential for olaparib in the treatment of brain tumours and pancreatic cancer.

Timothy Lyons said he earlier warned Mr Hankin he would not be standing in the same area due to a previous experience. Mr Lyons said in a statement that he saw Mr Hankin, a 33-year-old nurse and father-of-two, inside the Sheffield stadium before the Liverpool versus Nottingham Forest tie. He said: \"Whilst I was waiting for my wife, I saw Eric Hankin come out of the men's toilet and he came over to talk to me. \"I told him that I would not be going into the central pens, especially after what I had experienced the previous year. \"I told him that my wife and I would be going into pen seven. \"Eric Hankin told me he was going to go behind the goal.

He said: \"Our intention would have been to try to find a vantage point to watch the game, but any plans we had for that were gone as soon as we got in to the crowd and it was just chaos in there.\" In his 1989 statement, Mr Brown described how the crush became worse and he saw a man near him fall to the ground with his eyes closed. He told the court: \"It was different waves of pressure, because you would move in one direction and you would get caught in an area. \"The pressure would build and there would be a crush that would increase, increase, increase, and then it would be released and you would move suddenly to the side, or forward, or backwards and then the same thing would happen. \"The crushing just increased, released, increased, released and some people were lucky enough to get out when the pressure released.\" He said when the pressure was tight he was \"completely unable to draw breath\". The court saw a picture timed at about 15:02 BST, two minutes after the scheduled kick-off, which showed Mr Hankin towards the front of pen three. It is believed Mr Brown was also pictured to the right of his colleague. Mr Brown managed to escape through an open gate, the court heard.

{"article": "In the latest mishap, US citizens Bob Weise and Steve Shapiro, both 71, had to seek help in Hayle Harbour, Cornwall, when their sailing boat tipped over, causing a fire on board. Veteran sailor Sir Robin Knox-Johnston is among those criticising the pair. The duo previously told BBC News they were experienced enough for the trip. The boat, named Nora, left Norway in July and is aiming for the US state of Maine. Sir Robin said: \"This is no longer a joke. \"It costs between \u00c2\u00a36,000 and \u00c2\u00a38,000 every time a lifeboat is launched. These guys are costing the RNLI a fortune. \"They need to frankly pack it in or, I hate to say it, get the hell out of our waters.\" James Instance, from Falmouth Coastguard, said he was not aware of anyone being rescued so many times in a short space of time. Peter Haddock, Hayle harbourmaster, said he was worried about the sailors' safety and that of emergency services. Mr Haddock said he raised the alarm on Tuesday after seeing smoke coming from the vessel's forward hatch and described the pair as a \"catastrophe waiting to happen\". Fire crews extinguished a \"small fire\" on the 18-tonne yacht, which Mr Shapiro said was caused by a candle, and that \"otherwise there was no real damage\". Mr Shapiro, a screenwriter and author from California, said he had been sailing since he was nine and \"people had a right to be angry\". \"But it's not justifiable, we have the right to the services as much as anybody else. \"The volunteer organisations volunteered to come out, it was their decision.\" Mr Shapiro is accompanied by Mr Weise, who is an ex-US Army helicopter pilot and Vietnam veteran. The RNLI and Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) refused to comment on how much the rescues would have cost. A spokeswoman for the MCA said: \"Search resources are always used in incidents where people report seeing someone in trouble. \"We would always urge people to call 999 and ask for the coastguard if they're in danger or think someone else might be in distress. \"We never put a price on human life.

It is the first time a 7 Tesla MRI scanner will be used in the UK in a clinical setting. It will be used to improve treatment for conditions such as stroke, vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The facility was built in collaboration with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHS GGC), with \u00a316m of funding from the Medical Research Council and Glasgow City Region City Deal.

The US said it was \"deeply concerned\" and warned that settlement expansion posed a \"very serious and growing threat\" to peace with the Palestinians. About 570,000 Israelis live in more than 100 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. Peace Now reported that the latest planning decision by the Israeli military-run Civil Administration in the West Bank meant 2,623 housing units at settlements had been approved so far this year. The figure includes 756 illegally-built homes that have been retrospectively \"legalised\". A senior US official told the AFP news agency that settlement expansion - as well as continuing demolitions of Palestinian homes - \"fundamentally undermines the prospects for a two-state solution and risks entrenching a one-state reality of perpetual occupation and conflict\". \"We are particularly troubled by the policy of retroactively approving illegal outposts and unauthorised settlement units,\" the official said. \"These policies have effectively given the government's green light for the pervasive advancement of settlement activity in a new and potentially unlimited way.\" On Tuesday, Israel reacted angrily to similar criticism of its settlement activities by the UN special co-ordinator for the Middle East peace process, Nickolay Mladenov. \"It is difficult to read in these actions a genuine intention to work towards a viable two-state solution. This appears to reinforce a policy, carried out over decades, that has enabled over half a million Israelis to settle in territory that was occupied militarily in 1967,\" he told the UN Security Council.

{"article": "Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia won 16 of 22 cities with the anti-immigration Northern League and another party. The results were a setback for Matteo Renzi, the former centre-left prime minister seeking to return to power as head of the Democratic Party (PD). \"It could have gone better,\" he admitted in a social media post. The PD currently heads a coalition led by Paolo Gentiloni, who took over after Mr Renzi lost a referendum on electoral reform in December 2016. The biggest defeats for the PD were in party strongholds such as Genoa, La Spezia and L'Aquila. The centre-right also won in other provincial capitals including Monza, Piacenza and Pistoia. Mr Berlusconi, 80, will now set his sights on the next general election, which is due in 2018 but may take place earlier. Silvio Berlusconi may hope that 80 is the new 40. The gains made by his Forza Italia party in local elections allow him to claim the start of yet another political comeback. \"From these results the centre-right can set on a path to go back to ruling the country,\" he said in a statement. But there is a major road-block in the way of his return for a fourth time as prime minister: he is currently banned from holding political office. The ban, imposed following a 2013 conviction for tax fraud, doesn't expire until 2019. Unless he wins an early appeal at the European Court of Human Rights, Mr Berlusconi won't be able to run in Italy's 2018 general election. Mr Berlusconi founded Forza Italia in 1993 and became prime minister the following year, with the Northern League as part of his coalition government. Out of office in 1994, he then returned for a five-year period in 2001 and again in 2008 for three more years. His political career has been overshadowed by his legal battles, which culminated in a community service sentence for tax fraud. While Forza Italia's election advances were dramatic, commentators pointed to the low turnout of 46% and the first-past-the-post system in local elections.

{"article": "Anti-smoking groups say that is too long to wait, but there have been protests by some restaurant owners, who say their business will suffer. Austrians like order, or \"Ordnung\" as they say in German. It is hugely frowned upon for a pedestrian to cross the road on a red light. And the streets and underground network of Vienna are kept remarkably clean. But smoky air in cafes and restaurants has been widely tolerated for years. \"Smoking is a sort of culture, especially in Austria,\" Margit Schwed told me as she sat in Cafe Ritter in Vienna, with its gilt chandeliers and marble table tops. \"In the typical Vienna Kaffeehaus you take your coffee and your cigarette. I think people like the flair in the coffee houses.\" Austria has one of the highest rates of smoking in Europe, particularly among young people: 33% of Austrians smoke regularly, according to a 2012 Eurobarometer study. Only Greeks, Bulgarians and Latvians smoke more. A survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) found that 27% of Austrian 15-year-olds smoke at least once a week, more frequently than any other children in the OECD area. Several years ago, when many countries had already banned smoking in bars and cafes, Austria first adopted the idea of introducing separate smoking and non-smoking areas. Small restaurants could choose whether to go smoke-free or not. Larger restaurants, like Cafe Ritter, were obliged to provide a separate smoking section, sealed off by glass partitions. The law was heavily criticised by doctors and anti-smoking groups as half-hearted and badly enforced. Earlier this year, after the death of a prominent anti-smoking journalist from lung cancer, Austria's coalition government of the Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party announced plans to bring in a total ban on smoking in restaurants, cafes and bars by 2018. \"We have finally arrived in Europe with anti-smoking protection,\" Health Minister Sabine Oberhauser said. However there were protests from the far-right Freedom Party and from Austria's Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce opposes the ban, because it says restaurants and cafes invested around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100m ($109m; \u00c2\u00a3714m) to install ventilation systems and glass partitions to accommodate the separate smoking areas. The economy minister, Reinhold Mitterlehner, has said their interests will be taken into account. At Cafe Ritter, one of the waiters, Michael Schneider, told me the smoking ban should be brought in as soon as possible. \"Working in the smoke is bad for the health of me and my colleagues,\" he said.", "abstract": "After years of debate, Austria's government has announced plans to introduce a total smoking ban in cafes and restaurants by 2018.", "candidate": "Austria plans to ban smoking in restaurants, cafes and bars by 2018.", "doc_id": 2981, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "Earlier this year, after the death of a prominent anti-smoking journalist from lung cancer, Austria's coalition government of the Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party announced plans to bring in a total ban on smoking in restaurants, cafes and bars by 2018.", "explanation": "Austria, ban, smoking, restaurants cafes and bars and 2018 can all be verified in one sentence above.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

His lawyers say he recently suffered a stroke and is not physically or mentally capable of answering the charges. Prosecutors dispute this, saying he was under sedation at an initial hearing. Oscar Mejia was arrested in Guatemala City earlier this month after a warrant was issued against him on charges of genocide. He ruled Guatemala from 1983-86 after seizing power in a coup. He also served as an army general and defence minister during the long civil war, in which an estimated 200,000 people were killed as the army battled left-wing guerrillas. A UN-backed truth commission found that the security forces were responsible for the vast majority of killings. It also concluded that massacres of indigenous Maya communities accused of supporting the rebels amounted to acts of genocide. Few senior army commanders have ever faced trial for the atrocities, but in recent months the government of President Alvaro Colom has begun to try to bring suspected war criminals to justice.

Mr Lightsey and hunting guide Blake Godwin discovered the alligator in cattle ponds while supervising a guided hunt on Saturday. When the creature surfaced about 20ft (6m) away from them, they shot it. \"Although this animal is huge I was not that surprised it existed,\" Mr Lightsey said. \"We have come across lots over the last 20 years that have been only a little smaller. \"But what really drew our attention to this animal was the fact that it seems to have been feasting on the cattle on my farm, because mutilated body parts were found in the water. It was a monster which needed to be removed.\" Mr Lightsey's company arranges hunts for alligators, wild boar and turkey on the farm he owns for hunting trips. The largest alligator previously killed was just over 13ft (4m) long. He charges $10,000 (\u00a37,060; \u20ac8,780) to kill an alligator larger than 13ft (4m) and $4,500 (\u00a33,180; \u20ac3,955) to kill an alligator between 10ft and 12ft. The animals are mostly killed with a high-powered rifle. \"But always we kill them with the minimum of suffering without allowing them to be injured before they die,\" he said. There are hundreds of alligators for hunters between 10ft and 13ft, he says, while animals longer than 13ft are only encountered about once a year. Mr Lightsey has been commercially hunting alligators since he began \"harvesting\" them in 1988 and more than 5,000 alligators bigger than 1.5m have been killed since then. American alligators inhabit the south-east of the US with Florida and Louisiana each reported to have a population of more than one million alligators each.

{"article": "Trevor Timon, 31, hit 30-year-old Oliver Dearlove while the victim and his friends were talking to a group of women in Blackheath, south-east London, in August 2016. Timon admitted manslaughter but was cleared of murder at the Old Bailey. He was also given five years on extended licence as he was considered a \"significant risk\" to the public. Mr Dearlove died hours after the attack, which happened after he had struck up a friendly chat with the women, who had been out celebrating a birthday with Timon. How lives are devastated by a single blow . Timon demanded to know what they were discussing and told his victim \"if you don't get out of my face I will knock you out\", the court heard. He then punched Mr Dearlove in the side of the head with his left fist, sending him to the ground and knocking him out. A post-mortem examination found he died from bleeding to the brain. Judge Mark Dennis QC told Timon, who had a history of violence, Mr Dearlove had presented no threat and the punch was an \"unprovoked and gratuitous act\". \"This was a senseless death that occurred as a result of an act borne out of a flaw in your character which in the past has seen you display unnecessary violent conduct to others when, for reasons best known to you, you have become annoyed or wound yourself up,\" he said. \"Oliver Dearlove was a young man of fine character with a long and promising future ahead of him. His loss in such senseless circumstances has, as the court has heard, caused untold misery for his family and those close to him.\" \"Many lives have been turned upside down.\" Speaking before the sentence was handed down, Mr Dearlove's girlfriend Claire Wheatley broke down in tears as she described her heartbreak at losing her \"Mr Right\". The nurse described him as the \"most gentle, kind and relaxed person I have ever known and a true gentleman which is why so many people liked him.\" She said the couple had been making plans for the future before the \"dreaded knock on our door\". Miss Wheatley added: \"We are all familiar with the phrase 'a broken heart', but unless you have experienced some form of loss or sadness it is difficult to understand how this truly feels. \"On August 28 2016, I was unfortunate enough to learn its true meaning. \"The difference is my heart is not broken, it feels more like it has been obliterated.\" Mr Dearlove's mother Joy Wright told the court: \"No parent should have to make the decision to switch off their child's life support. \"Timon may as well have used a gun or knife, the damage he did. He then just walked away casually without a thought or care for what he had done. \"I think of Oli every morning when I wake and dream of him in my sleep. I see him as a baby, a schoolboy and as the smashing young man he had become, such a gentle unassuming soul.\" In a letter read to court, Timon said: \"There is not a single day that I don't think of Oliver, his friends and family and the devastating effects my action has caused.\" Timon was convicted of battery after he admitted punching a woman in the face, allegedly knocking her out having previously threatened to \"bang\" her out.

{"article": "Federal prosecutors announced the charges as they listed a catalogue of alleged abuses. The Justice Department has been scrutinising Baltimore police after accusing it last August of systemic racism and abusing power. The officers \"arrogantly\" ignored clear directives, a police official said. Police Commissioner Kevin Davis condemned the officers at a news conference. \"These officers are 1930s-style gangsters,\" Mr Davis said. \"They betrayed the trust we're trying to build with our community at a very sensitive time in our history.\" The seven officers are: Momodu Gondo, Evodio Hendrix, Daniel Hersl, Sergeant Wayne Jenkins, Jemell Rayam, Marcus Taylor and Maurice Ward. Mr Gondo is also charged with participating in a drug conspiracy. All of the men were arrested, suspended without pay and jailed, pending detention hearings on Thursday. Federal prosecutors said the men began their criminal enterprise in 2015, after the city erupted into protest over the death of a young black man, Freddie Gray, while he was in police custody. The Justice Department later opened a \"pattern and practice\" investigation into the police force, finding that the department routinely discriminated against black people and used excessive force. Federal agents by then had spent months following officers on the Gun Trace Task Force, which was formed to crack down on violent crime by tracking illegal guns on the streets. Prosecutors accuse the men of committing robberies and filing false reports to conceal their crimes. In one instance, four of the officers arrested a man during a traffic stop and confiscated drugs as well as $21,500 (\u00c2\u00a317,516). The officers only submitted $15,000 as evidence, and then later went to the man's home and stole $200,000 and a $4,000 watch from a safe deposit box. In another incident, three of the officers stopped a man on the street, searched his car without a warrant and later took $1,500 he had earned working as a maintenance supervisor at a nursing home. The charges were announced a day after US Attorney General Jeff Sessions suggested that he might ease federal scrutiny of law enforcement across the country as it could undermine their policing ability. Baltimore was one of dozens of US cities to face a federal civil rights probe under the Obama administration. The city and the Justice Department had reached a court-enforceable consent decree in January requiring police to make sweeping changes to its practices. Mr Obama made police reform a priority in the wake of mounting racial tension and high-profile police shootings across the country. Baltimore police union president Gene Ryan said he was \"disturbed\" by the recent charges. DeRay Mckesson, a local Black Lives Matter activist, said the charges were disturbing but signalled reform. \"It is promising to see the beginning of accountability being applied to the Baltimore Police Department,\" he said. \"The indictments confirm what activists and community members have been saying for decades.\"", "abstract": "Seven Baltimore police officers have been charged with robbery, extortion, falsely detaining people and faking reports to cover it up.", "candidate": "Seven Baltimore police officers have been charged with racketeering, robbery and other crimes.", "doc_id": 2687, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Seven Baltimore police officers have been charged with crimes.", "evidence": "The seven officers are: Momodu Gondo, Evodio Hendrix, Daniel Hersl, Sergeant Wayne Jenkins, Jemell Rayam, Marcus Taylor and Maurice Ward", "explanation": "it makes up the nature of the charges", "instruction": "Remove the information about the nature of the charges from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about the nature of the charges from the summary."]}}

{"article": "It has also announced a 5.5bn Australian dollar ($4.4bn; \u00c2\u00a32.8bn) capital-raising effort which will involve the selling of new shares. NAB wants to demerge and float its troubled British bank, Clydesdale, and shore up its balance sheet. The lender is one of the country's big four and the largest by assets. NAB's preferred cash profit measure for the period, excluding some accounting items, met forecasts and came to $A3.32bn. Its half-year net profit came in at $A3.44bn, up 20.4%. The cash profit number strips out some one-off accounting items and is the bank's preferred measure of performance. NAB's capital-raising announcement has been reported by some of Australia's media as being the largest in the country's corporate history. The bank also announced Australia's former treasury secretary Ken Henry would take over as its chairman, replacing the long-serving Michael Chaney in December. The lender's shares will be suspended from trade on the Australian stock exchange as its book-building activities commence. NAB is the last of the country's big banks to report this week, together with Commonwealth Bank of Australia, ANZ and Westpac. Other results were mixed, with lenders missing and beating expectations. The so-called big four are regarded as highly profitable, however, the latest results have concerned investors, with many analysts referring to a so-called new era that could see Australian banks fail to return any more record profits. The big four lenders came out of the global financial crisis relatively unscathed, but are now facing tighter regulatory controls. In a report published last year, Australian banks were told they needed to hold more capital to be able to survive future financial crises. The Financial System Inquiry report singled out bank competition, increased capital levels and inefficient taxes for reform. NAB's capital-raising effort is largely viewed as an attempt to get ahead of Australian regulators by further boosting its capital ratios. \"The chairman of APRA (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority) signalled that it would move sooner rather than later in requiring banks to hold more capital,\" said Shane Oliver, who is the head of investment strategy and chief economist with AMP Capital. \"But all the banks have had solid profit growth in recent years, partly helped by low rates and the housing recovery,\" Mr Oliver told the BBC. \"Clearly it can't be sustained at this rate going forward but I don't see a collapse in profits.\"", "abstract": "One of Australia's biggest lenders, National Australia Bank (NAB), has posted a 5.4% rise in cash profit year-on-year for the six months to March.", "candidate": "National Australia Bank (NAB), one of the country's big four lenders, has reported a rise in half-year profits.", "doc_id": 1817, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "NAB, one of the country's big four lenders, has reported a rise in half-year profits.", "evidence": "Its half-year net profit came in at $A3.44bn, up 20.4%.", "explanation": "The summary shows that NAB stands for \"National Australia Bank\" but the source text does not mention that fact.", "instruction": "Replace the information about National Australia Bank (NAB) with the information about NAB.", "instruction_list": ["Replace the information about National Australia Bank (NAB) with the information about NAB."]}}

{"article": "So why would a country like Zambia lift the ban on the shooting and killing of its precious lion and leopard populations? The answer is very clear - it is the need for foreign currency in order to fund sustainable wildlife programmes, which can be costly, and also to benefit local communities. Trophy hunting is a multi-million dollar industry - a licence to shoot a lion can cost up to $25,000 (\u00c2\u00a315,000) in neighbouring countries. Zambia's economy was built on the back of copper mining but now commodities are on a cyclical downward spiral. Consequently the country's currency, the kwacha, has lost a substantial amount of its value. For this small country, tourism is another way of bringing in foreign currency. There is no doubt that the beautiful banks of the Zambezi river in Livingstone and the Victoria Falls are still a draw card for international tourists but take a closer look at the numbers and it soon becomes clear that trophy hunters bring the lion's share of the greenback. Zambia's country director of the World Wildlife Fund Nyambe Nyambe told me that when the ban was initially announced back in 2013 \"there were not enough monitoring systems in place\". The government lifted the ban following expert recommendations which suggested that hunting resumption would \"assist communities in affected areas with access to financial benefits\", he said. Mr Nyambe also explained that \"concerns about the big cats conservation led to the ban in the first place and there is due recognition of the same as the ban is being lifted\". The authorities saw the need for a robust and implementable plan for leopards as well, as they have different needs to lions. Hunting regulations were structured only for lions because hunters were mostly interested in the king of the jungle. Mr Nyambe added: \"We hope and trust that the hunting of big cats will be an integral part of sustainable harvesting of wildlife resources.\" But critics say there is no justification for shooting majestic animals such as the elusive African leopard just so that wealthy hunters, largely from the West, can pose for photos with dead animals. And there is one country on the continent that wants no part in the hunting of wildlife - Zambia's neighbour, Botswana. It has an established tradition of \"shoot with the camera not the gun\". Last week an American hunter paid $350,000 for a licence to shoot a black rhinoceros in Namibia. Corey Knowlton, from Texas, killed the rhino with a high-powered rifle after a three-day hunt through the bush with government officials on hand to ensure he killed the correct animal, which had reportedly been chosen as it was old and had become aggressive. Mr Knowlton, 36, won the right to shoot the rhino at an auction - attracting criticism, and even death threats, from conservationists. His supporters argued that the money raised would be used to protect other rhinos - there are just 5,000 left in the world, 2,000 of which are in Namibia. Zambia cannot be singled out for criticism because trophy hunting, albeit not always for endangered species or exotic animals, is allowed in many parts of the world including Europe and the US. But to be fair to the international hunter, local communities also hunt animals for their own purposes - whether to eat or to protect their livestock from predators. Animal rights groups hope that someday, in the not-too-distant future, there will come a time when the killing of wild animals will simply be outlawed.", "abstract": "Big-cat trophy hunting is regarded by many as primitive in this day and age.", "candidate": "Africa is home to some of the world's most majestic animals.", "doc_id": 3328, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Africa is home to some majestic animals.", "evidence": "But critics say there is no justification for shooting majestic animals such as the elusive African leopard just so that wealthy hunters, largely from the West, can pose for photos with dead animals.", "explanation": "Africa having majestic animals is supported by the text but there is no proof that they are some of the world's most majestic animals.", "instruction": "Remove the information about of the world's most from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about of the world's most from the summary."]}}
{"article": "The skeleton was unearthed during a large-scale excavation of the Swinegate area of York in 1990. The York Archaeological Trust (YAT) said more than 100 burial sites were discovered, many dating from between the 9th and 11th Century. The skeleton and coffin are being displayed at the city's Jorvik Viking Centre. York was occupied by the Vikings from the late 9th Century until the middle of the 10th Century, when it was absorbed into the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of England. The Swinegate dig explored the churchyard of the former church of St Benet, which had stood on the site from the 8th to the early 14th Century. Unusually, a number of timber coffins had survived. Sarah Maltby, director of attractions for the trust, said: \"As we found in the Coppergate dig of the late 1970s, York's waterlogged soil conditions preserved the timber of several coffins, including this one, so what our archaeologists unearthed represents a series of previously undisturbed burials with complete skeletons, some of which date back more than 1,000 years.\" She said the condition of the wood gave the coffin a national significance, as so few similar examples exist.

{"article": "Since April, convicted criminals in England and Wales have had to pay a charge of between \u00a3150 and \u00a31,200 towards the cost of their case. But Mr Gove said \"while the intention behind the policy was honourable in reality that intent has fallen short\". MPs had called for it to be axed and the Magistrates Association said the decision was \"tremendously welcome\". The charge is paid on top of fines, compensation orders and defendants' own legal charges, and is higher for those convicted after pleading not guilty. It is set according to the type of case, with the minimum charge for magistrates' courts and the maximum level for crown court cases. In March, the then Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the fee would ensure that criminals \"pay their way\". But MPs on the Justice Committee published a report in November in which they said the fee, which is not means-tested, created \"serious problems\" and was often \"grossly disproportionate\". The cross-party group's chairman, Conservative MP Bob Neill, said they evidence they had received raised \"grave misgivings\" about the fee's benefits and whether it was \"compatible with the principles of justice\". He said it created \"perverse incentives - not only for defendants to plead guilty but for sentencers to reduce awards of compensation and prosecution costs\". Mr Gove, Mr Grayling's successor as justice secretary, announced it was being dropped, during a meeting of the Magistrates' Association Council. The Magistrates' Association's national chairman, Malcolm Richardson said: \"This is an enormous success for the MA (Magistrates' Association) but most importantly for justice in our criminal courts system. \"In my 26 years as a magistrate I have never seen such a powerful reaction from my colleagues on the bench and Michael Gove's announcement is therefore tremendously welcome.\" Justice Select Committee chairman Bob Neill said it was \"good\" Mr Gove was \"willing to respond so swiftly to take account of the inquiry we carried out and the evidence submitted to us\". \"We will watch with interest the review which Michael Gove has announced into the whole panoply of financial impositions on offenders,\" he added. The Howard League for Penal Reform - which has called for the fee policy to be suspended - also welcomed the news, saying the charge was \"simply unfair\". Its chief executive, Frances Crook said: \"This is a victory for justice. It augurs well for changes being made to the courts and penal systems, which both need radical reform.\" Meanwhile, Labour said it had warned from the start that the \"mandatory nature of the fee could lead to miscarriages of justice\" and welcomed that it \"has finally been scrapped\". Mr Gove told Parliament in November that the charge was generating revenue and helping to \"ensure that the taxpayer is not the first port of call for supporting the way in which our courts operate, but it is important that we balance all the criteria in making a judgment on the review of the charge\".", "abstract": "The criminal courts charge is to be scrapped from 24 December, Justice Secretary Michael Gove has announced.", "candidate": "A controversial criminal prosecution fee is to be scrapped, Justice Secretary Michael Gove has announced.", "doc_id": 1943, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "Meanwhile, Labour said it had warned from the start that the \"mandatory nature of the fee could lead to miscarriages of justice\" and welcomed that it \"has finally been scrapped\".", "explanation": "Michael Gove did say it has finally been scrapped and also that it could lead to miscarriages of justice which would be controversial.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

{"article": "They have been removed to stop the spread of ash dieback, a fungal disease that can infect mature trees and saplings. Scientists have warned that if it is not contained it could change the landscape and affect our biodiversity. It has been found on around 100 sites in Northern Ireland. All those sites were planted with imported saplings, some of which had the infection. Infected ash trees were destroyed along with any others planted alongside. That led to the removal of 100,000 young trees. The disease is widespread in Europe where it is killing mature trees. In Northern Ireland, it is mostly in saplings planted within the past five years. It spreads on the wind by spores. Scientists at the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI) in Belfast are trying to establish if that is happening in Northern Ireland yet. Prof Alistair McCracken, a plant pathologist with AFBI, said: \"This is a serious disease. In Denmark they say up to 90% of the ash trees have been infected. \"Now they haven't all died, but they have been affected and are looking quite sickly so potentially this could have a huge impact on the Northern Ireland environment.\" Infected ash trees will not recover, although mature trees can survive for a long time. The fungus appears between June and September on leaf litter. Each pinhead size fungus can produce large numbers of spores. When they land on a fresh ash leaf they germinate, penetrate the surface and grow into the stem. The first symptom is wilting leaves. As it gets worse the trees will develop a diamond-shaped dark-coloured lesion on the bark. In Denmark, Sweden and east European countries, where the disease has been present for 30 years, large numbers of trees have become infected. Scientists are worried about its impact in Northern Ireland, where ash is a common tree. They are carrying out a survey of more than 1,000 sites to identify any further problems. And they have asked for the public's help. The authorities have developed a smartphone app called Tree Check that the public can use to report potential problems, including a picture and a GPS position. They will then be assessed and, if necessary, the site visited by experts. Jim Crummie, plant health expert with the Forest Service urged the public to download the app and to be the \"eyes and ears\" of the authorities in the fight to combat the disease.

EU rules allow R&D investment, illicit gambling, drug dealing and activities linked to prostitution to be included. Separate figures showed the economy grew 2.7% in the first quarter of 2014. And the sharp contraction in the economy in the final three months of 2013 was revised to show that it shrank less than thought, by 0.1% rather than 2.3%. The GDP recalculation does not affect the growth figures, because previous years have also been recalculated. In October's budget, Finance Minister Michael Noonan outlined 2bn euros ($2.7bn) programme of tax hikes and spending cuts to meet a deficit target of 3% of GDP by the end of next year. Last month, he suggested that the enlargement of GDP under the new EU rules could mean the programme might be reined back, as the debt and deficit will appear smaller when measured against the new \"larger\" economy . Conall Mac Coille, chief economist at Davy Group, Ireland's biggest securities firm, estimated that the new numbers meant Ireland's debt-to-GDP ratio stood at 116% and its deficit at 6.7% of GDP at the end of last year . Previously, those figures had been 123.7% and 7.2%. He said: \"It's a measurement issue rather than a real improvement. But since exchequer returns were outperforming anyway, it looks as though the finance minister can bring the deficit down below 4% of GDP by the end of the year and hit his deficit target of 3% easily by the end of 2015, without having to do very much at all in the way of austerity.\" Mr Mac Coille estimates that R&D expenditure contributed more than 90% of the extra GDP, with illegal activities making up the rest.

The Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam, which all Muslims are called upon to perform at least once. On Saturday it emerged that Saudi Arabia's top cleric, Abdul Aziz al-Sheikh, would not deliver the traditional Hajj sermon for the first time in 35 years because of health complications. It follows controversy sparked by his remarks that Iranians were \"not Muslims\". The comments came after Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei denounced Saudi Arabia's management of the Hajj. Iran has boycotted this year's pilgrimage., instead endorsing an alternative event on Saturday at the holy city of Karbala in Iraq. Tensions between the two countries have risen after a crush in last year's pilgrimage killed at least 2,426 people, including 464 Iranians, according to an unofficial count. Saudi Arabia and Iran do not have diplomatic relations and are at loggerheads over a series of regional issues including the conflicts in Yemen and Syria.

{"article": "Their 340-day mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS) is twice the length of a normal stay. Their extended tour is part of an effort to study the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the body. But scientists will gain further insights by comparing Scott Kelly with his Earthbound identical twin, Mark. A Soyuz capsule carrying Kelly, Kornienko and Russian crew member Sergey Volkov parachuted down on to a steppe in Kazakhstan at 10:26 local time (04:26 GMT). The mission is a record for the ISS and will give Cmdr Kelly a tally of 520 cumulative days in space, over four flights. In pictures: Scott Kelly's year in space . Tim Peake's space plant experiment . Cmdr Kelly has also returned rocket (salad) seeds that were taken up to the orbiting outpost by UK astronaut Tim Peake in December. They will be distributed to schools to allow pupils to compare their growth with rocket plants that have stayed on Earth. The idea behind the twin study is to help minimise extraneous factors as scientists research how genetically identical individuals respond to different conditions over a year. The harsh space environment takes its toll in the form of muscle atrophy, sleep problems, bone loss, vision impairment and radiation exposure. But some of the most pronounced effects are on the mind. Before landing, Cmdr Kelly told reporters during a live link-up: \"Physically I feel pretty good... but the hardest part is being isolated in the physical sense from people on the ground who are important to you. There's a loss of connection.\" From Kazakhstan, Cmdr Kelly will be flown to Houston in the US, where researchers at the US space agency (Nasa) will begin a series of scientific checks. Mark Kelly, who was an astronaut, now retired, has been undergoing tests of his own on Earth during his brother's sojourn on the ISS. Comparisons between the twins should allow scientists to deepen their understanding of the subtle physical and psychological shifts that occur during long stays on orbit. Nasa says the research should inform its stated aim of one day sending humans to Mars. After returning from an extended stay in the weightless environment of space, many astronauts have difficulty walking unaided. Shortly after landing, Kelly, Kornienko and Volkov will enter a medical tent to participate in a series of \"field tests\" that will assess their balance, co-ordination and ability to walk. Returning ISS crews have immediate access to medical assistance, but future crews to Mars will have little time to recover once they land on the Red Planet's surface.

{"article": "The taxi-app firm said the sackings related to sexual harassment, bullying and issues about poor company culture. Uber has been under fire over its treatment of women staff since a former employee wrote a scathing blog post about her experience. It led to two investigations and the uncovering of 215 complaints about harassment and other allegations. Uber has struggled with a series of controversies in recent months, including a backlash over aggressive corporate tactics and a lawsuit from Google-owner Alphabet over allegedly stolen technology for self-driving cars. Several high-placed executives resigned amid the turbulence, including a former head of engineering, who had failed to disclose harassment complaints at his former employer. Chief executive Travis Kalanick's filmed argument with an Uber driver over falling rates also fuelled criticism, leading him to say that he needed \"leadership help\". Susan Fowler, who wrote the critical blog post about Uber, said the company had ignored her complaints of sexual harassment. Widely shared, the blog prompted Mr Kalanick to launch the investigations. Does Silicon Valley have a sexism problem? Uber's mess reaches beyond sexism - and Silicon Valley . Law firm Perkins Coie reviewed 215 claims, which included sexual harassment and discrimination as well as other complaints, an Uber spokeswoman said. The firm recommended no action in 100 of them; 57 remain under review, while others have received warnings or are in training, she said. Some of those fired held senior positions, she said. Discrimination, 54; Sexual harassment, 47; Unprofessional behaviour, 45; Bullying, 33; Other harassment, 19; Retaliation, 13; Physical security 3; Wrongful dismissal 1. Staff fired, 20; Staff put in training, 31; Final warnings, 7; Claims still under review, 57. Uber has also appointed Eric Holder, who served as attorney general under former US president Barack Obama, to investigate the company's broader culture. The findings of that report have been turned over to the board and recommendations are expected to be made public next week. Some changes are already in place. Uber announced the hiring of two women to high profile positions this week. Frances Frei, a Harvard Business School professor, will serve as a senior vice president for leadership and strategy, working with the head of human resources Liane Hornsey. Ms Hornsey is herself relatively new, starting at the company in January. Bozoma Saint John, a former marketing executive at Apple, is also joining Uber as chief brand officer. Uber employs more than 12,000 people globally. About 36% of the workforce is female, according to a diversity report the firm published earlier this year. Women hold about 15% of the technology positions. It goes without saying that this issue doesn't go away with these firings. Uber has major questions still to answer - some of them will hopefully be addressed when more details of the report are made public. Most troubling is why Uber's own internal HR measures weren't thorough or fair enough to see that the actions of 20 employees warranted dismissal. Instead it took a brave former employee - and then an expensive, lengthy investigation - to get to that point. So as well as detailing what it has done to address those existing complaints, Uber will now have to be very clear about how it will handle such issues in future. Crucially, the lessons from this report should not be heeded by Uber alone.

{"article": "Researchers say the 1,000-year-old object with a swastika on its stomach is made from a rare form of iron with a high content of nickel. They believe it is part of the Chinga meteorite, which crashed about 15,000 years ago. The findings appear in the Journal, Meteoritics and Planetary Science. The 24cm (9-inch) tall statue is 10kg (22lb) and is called the Iron Man. The story of this priceless object owes more perhaps to an Indiana Jones film script than sober scientific research. It was discovered in Tibet in 1938 by German scientist Ernst Schafer. His expedition was supported by the Nazis, in particular by Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS. Himmler was said to believe the Aryan race originated in Tibet and was keen to recover objects from the area. Brought back to Germany, the statue became part of a private collection and disappeared from view until 2007. A new owner then sought scientific advice on the origins. He turned to Dr Elmar Buchner from the University of Stuttgart. \"I was absolutely sure it was a meteorite when I saw it first, even at 10 metres\" said Dr Buchner. He said that the clue was in small, thumb like impressions caused by the melting of the surface. Further analysis showed that it was a rare ataxite class, a type of meteorite not often found on Earth. \"It is rich in nickel, it is rich in cobalt. Less than 0.1% of all meteorites and less than 1% of iron meteorites are ataxites, so it is the rarest type of meteorites you can find.\" Meteorites have been seen as a sign of divine activity across many cultures since the dawn of time. Knives and jewellery were made from iron meteorites by ancient Inuit. But tracing their exact origins is often extremely difficult. The German and Austrian scientists who worked on the Iron Man with Dr Buchner were surprised to be able to trace the statue to a specific event in meteorite history. The researchers believe it was carved from a piece of the Chinga meteorite that fell in the border region of eastern Siberia and Mongolia about 15,000 years ago. The debris from the crash was only discovered in 1913 by gold prospectors, but the individual fragment from which the statue was carved was collected many centuries before. \"We were quite astonished by the results,\" said Dr Buchner. \"OK, it's a meteorite but what amazed me was that we could also say it was from Chinga, that we could find the provenance, that was really astonishing for me.\" The statue is believed to portray the god Vaisravana. The researchers think it belongs to the pre-Buddhist Bon culture that existed in Asia about 1,000 years ago. \"If we are right that it was made in the Bon culture in the 11th Century, it is absolutely priceless and absolutely unique worldwide,\" observed Dr Buchner. Neither the person who carved it or the Nazis had any idea it was made from such a rare substance, he said. In keeping with the Hollywood element in the story, Dr Buchner said the statue had a certain aura. \"It is extremely impressive, it was formerly almost completely gilded - there is a great mystery represented by it.\"", "abstract": "An ancient statue that was recovered by a Nazi expedition in the 1930s was originally carved from a highly valuable meteorite.", "candidate": "Scientists say they have traced the origins of an Iron Man statue found in Tibet in 1938.", "doc_id": 1304, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "Scientists say they have traced the origins of the Iron Man statue found in Tibet in 1938.", "evidence": "Researchers say the 1,000-year-old object with a swastika on its stomach is made from a rare form of iron with a high content of nickel.", "explanation": "by substituting an for the, it makes the reader assume it's Marvel's Iron man or something, rather than a statue called the Iron Man", "instruction": "Replace the information about an Iron Man with the information about the Iron Man.", "instruction_list": ["Replace the information about an Iron Man with the information about the Iron Man."]}}

The Association was it was \"deeply disturbed to learn of Randolph College's continuing sale of works of art from the collection of its Maier Museum of Art to provide general operating funds for the College\". \"The prohibition against the sale of works of art from museum collections for such purposes is a violation of one of the most fundamental professional principles of the art museum field,\" a statement said.

The Association said it offered help by investigating other means by which the college could tackle its financial shortfall. But in 2008 the college sold a Rufino Tamayo painting, Trovador, prompting the AAMD to censure the Maier Museum \"to signal its objection to this action\" and \"discourage\" further sales from the collection. Following last month's Bellows sale, it once again sought \"to encourage the College to find other solutions\" to support their operating costs. The college's unwillingness to alter their course led to the announcement of sanctions, which calls on all AAMD member museums to suspend loans to the Maier Museum and refuse collaboration on joint exhibitions. \"We appreciate both the College's decision to sell Men of the Docks to a public institution, thus ensuring that this work will remain in the public domain, and the educational exchange that the College and the purchaser of the painting, the National Gallery of Art in London, are launching,\" the statement continued. \"Nevertheless, these steps - however laudable they may be - do not mitigate the fact that the funds realised from this sale will be utilised for a purpose that we believe will, ultimately, be damaging to our field,\" it added. The Bellows purchase marked the National Gallery's first major acquisition of a painting by an American artist. \"We feel proud that an international audience will now become more aware of Randolph and our long stewardship of Men of the Docks,\" college president Bradley W Bateman said at the time of the sale.

{"article": "They think it could be used to improve nutritional advice or in weight loss because people are notoriously bad at recording their own eating habits. The test, detailed in the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology, detects chemicals made as food is processed by the body. The research team believe it could be widely available within two years. The urine samples are analysed to determine the structure of the chemicals floating around in it using a technique called a proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This gives clues to both recent meals and long term dietary habits. The results of your body processing fruit, vegetables, fish and different types of meat leave a distinct signature in the urine. Clues to the state of the body's metabolism and gut health can also be detected by investigating the chemicals in it. The test was developed by a collaboration between Imperial College London, Newcastle University and Aberystwyth University. Dr Isabel Garcia-Perez, one of the researchers at Imperial, said: \"This will eventually provide a tool for personalised dietary monitoring to help maintain a healthy lifestyle. \"We're not at the stage yet where the test can tell us a person ate 15 chips yesterday and two sausages, but it's on the way.\" In trials, around 60% of people either under or over report what they are eating. Prof Gary Frost, another scientist at Imperial, said this could be the first independent test of what people munch on at home. He told the BBC News website: \"You can really tell whether someone's been following a healthy diet or not. \"The bigger you are the more likely you are to under-report what you eat. \"People find it difficult to open up to what types of foods they eat at home, which is a major problem.\" The researchers believe the test results could help combat people's obesity or risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Prof Frost said: \"If someone is very big and their profile says they're eating lots of energy dense foods like meat, then you can try to change that profile and then test them again later. \"It remains to be seen, but people might respond better to that and there is a desperate need for tools to help people change their diet.\" He says doing the test on large numbers of people would build up a picture of what the nation was really eating, which could be used to design better public health campaigns. The scientists were able to spot the difference between healthy and unhealthy diets after tests on 19 people who spent days eating a carefully controlled set of meals. Four diets of varying degrees of healthiness were given to the patients and their urine was sampled morning, noon and night. Dr Des Walsh, from the UK Medical Research Council, commented: \"Though this research is still in its early stages, it's grappling with essential methods in food and diet studies where advances are really needed. \"Measuring what we eat and drink more accurately will widen the benefits of nutrition research, developing better evidence-based interventions to improve an individual's health and reduce obesity.\" Follow James on Twitter.", "abstract": "A urine test that can reveal how healthy your meals are has been developed by UK scientists.", "candidate": "Scientists say they have developed a urine test that can tell whether a person is following a healthy or unhealthy diet.", "doc_id": 2769, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "The results of your body processing fruit, vegetables, fish and different types of meat leave a distinct signature in the urine.", "explanation": "The source text clearly states that \"scientists were able to spot the difference between healthy and unhealthy diets after tests\" and that in these tests \"urine samples are analysed\".

{"article": "As violent protests erupted in the capital, Delhi, at the weekend over the horrific gang rape of a 23-year-old student, many Indians were asking this question. It took nearly a week of protests for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to appear on TV pleading for calm and promising to make India safer for women. Many thought it was ironical that India's most powerful woman, Congress party chief Sonia Gandhi, met a group of outraged students only after massive public demonstrations had been widely televised. Many believe that the violence could have been prevented if either Mr Singh or Mrs Gandhi, or even one of the young ministers, had gone to meet the protesters and promised stern action against wrongdoers and reform of India's broken criminal justice system. That was not all. The city police commissioner told a news channel that even men were unsafe in Delhi as \"their pockets were picked\" - a shocking gaffe that appeared to equate rape with pick-pocketing. Federal Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde told another channel that ministers could not be expected to personally meet every group of protestors, \"like political party workers or Maoists\", appearing again to equate ultra-left rebels with angry students, justly upset over the rising tide of crimes against women. Many attribute such attitudes to the sheer hubris of India's ruling class - \"they are our rulers, not representatives\", was an angry refrain during the protests last week - in what many cynics describe as a modern-day \"feudal democracy\". Others argue it points to the increasing disconnect between India's rulers and its people, the perpetuation of what many call a paternalistic ruling class which talks to its citizens rather than listening to them. Many politicians and bureaucrats appear to lack communication skills to engage with a young, increasingly empowered and aspirational citizenry, who are demanding more from their rulers. \"Young India, old politicians,\" as author Gurcharan Das once described this dichotomy. Such alienation bodes ill for the future of the world's largest democracy, some think. Analysts like Pratap Bhanu Mehta argue that it leads to the disengagement of democracy from legitimacy. \"India's citizens vote in large numbers\", he says, \"but if the same citizens were truly engaged in the process of making laws, laws would be seen as legitimate and there would be minimal need for enforcement\". I believe there is one more reason for this anomie: the decline of genuine mass politicians. Time was when India was known for its charismatic, mass-based politicians - Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Jayaprakash Narayan were just some of them - who could easily lead from the front. Today, there are only a handful, two of whom - Mayawati and Mamata Banerjee - are actually women. The reticent prime minister himself has never won an election, and Mrs Gandhi and her son and heir apparent, Rahul Gandhi, hardly speak to the citizens. When he was going around Delhi in 1947 after India's bloody partition, Nehru saw Hindus and Muslims rioting. He jumped out of his car, broke the security cordon, ran into the crowd and stopped the clash. Mahatma Gandhi routinely travelled to trouble spots to stop religious clashes and douse tensions.

But Youngs, who has 28 England caps and three for the British and Irish Lions - is among those to stress the need for a long summer break and pre-season, rather than shorter rest periods during the campaign. \"It would shorten pre-seasons, and pre-season is so vital to get us ready to go through the season,\" he added. \"I know in June, if I don't go on any tours or anything, I have five weeks off and that is nice to know.

The move follows an investigation by the BBC and its US partners into Dapp Malawi, the Malawian branch of charity Development Aid from People to People. Dapp is one of the major NGOs active in Malawi, providing a range of aid projects from farming to health and education.

{"article": "Unite was responding to Plaid Cymru's economy spokesman Adam Price, who urged steel workers to reject a move from final salary pensions. Balloting is expected to begin at the end of January. Tata said pension reform is essential to a deal that would see \u00c2\u00a31bn invested at Port Talbot over 10 years. The company made a commitment to secure jobs and production at Port Talbot and its other steelworks in December. But Plaid AM Mr Price said Tata was being \"opportunistic\", adding workers should ask it to rethink the offer. The financial climate around the steel industry has changed over the last 12 months. World steel prices have risen from $385 per tonne of hot rolled coil a year ago, when Tata announced more than 1,000 UK job losses, to $536 per tonne by August just after the company put the sale of its Welsh operations on hold. China had been accused of selling surplus steel to Europe at below cost price, driving down its market value. But last summer, the European Union continued imposing tariffs on foreign imports - with up to 22% levied on cold rolled steel, which is used in cars and washing machines. And the turnaround plan put in place at the biggest plant, Port Talbot, saw the reported losses of \u00c2\u00a31m a day at the site reduced. Mark Turner, a Unite union official at Port Talbot, said: \"When politicians start making comments on either side, they need to understand what they're doing and the influence they have on people. \"There are personal decisions to make but also the future of the steel industry, there are a lot of things people have to take into consideration. \"We'd like politicians to keep their opinions to themselves for the time being.\" Meanwhile, Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock criticised Mr Price, saying he was \"astonished\" at his intervention, given the delicacy of the situation. \"This is a very personal decision that the steelworkers have to make, based on a range of factors,\" said the Labour MP. \"There have been some very impressive proposals from Tata Steel in terms of securing long term future of the works. \"But on the other hand there are some difficult proposals for the workers to swallow in terms of the pension scheme and the workforce should be allowed to get all the information they need and to vote according what they think is the best thing to do. \"It is not right that any politician should be coming in and meddling in what is a very personal decision.\"", "abstract": "One of the biggest unions at Tata says politicians should not interfere in the workers' ballot over whether to accept a less generous pension scheme.", "candidate": "Politicians should \"keep their opinions to themselves\" on the future of the steel industry, a union has said.", "doc_id": 1327, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "Politicians should \"keep their opinions to themselves\" on the future of the steel industry, a union official has said.", "evidence": "\"We'd like politicians to keep their opinions to themselves for the time being.\"", "explanation": "it attributes the quote from a union official as being made by the union itself", "instruction": "Replace the information about the union making the quote with the information about a union official making the quote.", "instruction_list": ["Replace the information about the union making the quote with the information about a union official making the quote."]}}

{"article": "Col Israel Shomer fired at Mohammed Kasbeh after the 17-year-old threw a stone at his vehicle in the West Bank. Israel's military said at the time that Col Shomer felt his life was in danger. But the video released by B'Tselem appears to show the teenager running away after attacking the vehicle. Soldiers then jump out and pursue him. B'Tselem also said medical evidence suggested that he was shot in the back. The Israeli military has not commented on the video, but the Times of Israel reported that Col Shomer had been interviewed under caution by military police investigating the shooting following its release. The incident took place on 3 July at the Qalandiya checkpoint between Jerusalem and Ramallah, the scene of frequent clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli troops. A vehicle carrying Col Shomer, commander of the army's Binyamin Brigade, was hit by stones thrown by a group of youths, shattering its windshield. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said at the time that the colonel got out of the vehicle and ordered the stone-throwers to stop, firing a warning shot into the air. When the attack continued, he opened fire at the main perpetrator, it added. The IDF stressed that Col Shomer believed he was in \"imminent mortal danger\" and several members of the government praised his actions. But witnesses cast doubt on the commander's account. Ahmed Taher, 17, who was throwing rocks beside Kasbeh, told the Washington Post after his funeral: \"We were running away.\" Fahdi Ziad, who works at a nearby petrol station, told the Guardian that three Israeli soldiers - two wearing a helmet, and one without one - chased after the teenagers and opened fire. Mr Ziad said Kasbeh was about 10-15m (33-49ft) from the soldiers when he was shot. \"After he fell on the ground the soldier without the helmet went and checked him and kicked him,\" he added. Palestinian doctors also said the teenager was shot in the back and the side of the head. On Monday, B'Tselem released video footage recorded by a security camera at the petrol station showing the moments before the shooting. It shows a person believed to be Kasbeh running at the Israeli army vehicle as it passes by and throwing a stone. He then runs away as the car then brakes suddenly and at least two soldiers get out, brandishing weapons. In a statement, B'Tselem said the footage showed Col Shomer's claim of self-defence was \"unreasonable\". \"There is no doubt that the shattering of the jeep's front window with a stone endangered the passengers when it happened. However, Kasbeh was shot in the back after the fact, when he was already running away and posing no 'mortal threat' to the soldiers. Feeling a sense of danger is not enough to justify any action.\" The rights group also noted that the video contradicted the IDF's claim that Col Shomer had carried out \"suspect-arrest procedure\". \"Military open-fire regulations permit shooting at the legs of a suspect in order to facilitate his arrest. They do not permit killing him by firing three shots at his upper body,\" it added. Thaer Kasbah, the dead teenager's brother, told the Associated Press that it was clear from the video that Col Shomer \"wanted to kill him\".

{"article": "Nine Madryn Street, Toxteth, where the drummer lived until he was four, is among 271 homes which are due to be cleared under regeneration plans. Housing Minister Grant Shapps had asked for alternative plans to be considered to renovate the homes. The communities secretary still needs to approve the plans before demolition. Eric Pickles is considering a request by campaigners for a full environmental assessment before the area is razed. The street is one of several known as the Welsh Streets, which were built in the late 19th Century when there was an influx of Welsh people who came to Liverpool to work as dockers. At a planning meeting at Liverpool Town Hall earlier, residents of the streets pleaded with the council to knock down what they called \"damp slums\" and replace them with modern homes. Opponents of the demolition said the streets had historical importance to Beatles fans as well as potential tourist value. The childhood homes of John Lennon - Mendips, in Menlove Avenue - and Sir Paul McCartney - in Forthlin Road - are preserved as tourist attractions supported by the National Trust. George Harrison's Arnold Grove childhood home remains a private house. A request for the Madryn Street house to be put under a preservation order was turned down by English Heritage last year, which ruled the property had no associations with the success of the Beatles as a group. Liverpool City Council Leader Joe Anderson said the area was in dire need of regeneration. He said: \"A majority of the local community have expressed support for our plans since we started consulting on this plan over a decade ago. \"They are sick of living in poky, damp infested properties. They want and deserve decent, modern homes with gardens and space for a car and are exasperated and frustrated at the delays to this scheme.\" He added: \"I pledged last year that if a developer came forward with a viable proposal to retain the Welsh Streets then we would look seriously at their plans. I am sorry to say that this has not happened. \"It is simply not fair to keep the local community in limbo any longer. \"People have been voting with their feet for years and moving away from the Welsh Streets which is why the housing market in the area has completely collapsed.\" Irene Milson, chair of the tenants' and residents' association, said of the decision to demolish the house: \"I can't explain, I really can't explain, it's jubilation. \"It's been 10 years of hard work from the start to now, I just can't put it into words.\" However Phillip Coppell, chairman of the Save Madryn Street campaign, said the fight was not yet over. He said: \"Demolition is not a foregone conclusion. We have people waiting in the wings who are prepared to redevelop the area and refurbish so we are still hopeful. \"It is an important part of the heritage trail.

{"article": "President Donald Trump has questioned the neutrality of Mr Mueller, who was appointed to investigate Russian interference in the US election. He has also blamed Attorney General Jeff Sessions for Mr Mueller's probe. Mr Graham warned Mr Trump that firing Mr Mueller \"would be the beginning of the end\" of his presidency. \"Any effort to go after Mueller could be the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency unless Mueller did something wrong,\" Mr Graham told reporters on Thursday. The Trump administration has sought to discredit Mr Mueller over his friendship with former FBI chief James Comey, who had been heading the inquiry until he was sacked by Mr Trump in May. The president has also suggested Mr Mueller's team of lawyers could be biased as some had made campaign contributions to Democrats. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington . There's no telling if Lindsey Graham's legislation insulating the independent counsel Robert Mueller from Donald Trump's wrath will go anywhere. The South Carolina Republican has been known to occasionally wander from the Senate flock. Still, this could be the first glimmers of bipartisan congressional efforts to construct a restraining barrier around the Trump presidency. Already it appears likely a bill preventing Donald Trump from unilaterally loosening current Russia sanctions will wind up on the president's desk. Despite the administration's objections that this infringes on executive foreign policy prerogatives, hardly any members of Congress have voted against the legislation. Now, amid concerns that Mr Trump may fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions as a way of getting at Mr Mueller, another set of handcuffs could be applied. The White House appears to be girding for war against those investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election and any connections to the Trump campaign. Chances are this more aggressive posture, including a presidential feud with Mr Sessions - who served in the US Senate for 20 years - will only make matters worse, however. Like a person trapped in quicksand, the more the president struggles, the deeper he sinks. Mr Mueller has not given any details of his investigation but US media have reported he is investigating Mr Trump for possible obstruction of justice, both in the firing of Mr Comey and whether Mr Trump tried to end an inquiry into sacked national security adviser Michael Flynn. President Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia, calling it a \"witch hunt\". The South Carolina Republican announced he was creating a measure aimed at protecting Mr Mueller by mandating that any special counsel appointed to investigate a president or his staff could not be fired \"unless you have judicial review of the firing\". He added that Mr Trump was crossing a \"red line\" in his consideration to axe Mr Mueller, who was appointed by the Justice Department to lead the probe after Mr Comey was fired. Mr Graham's warning comes as the president has repeatedly attacked Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from the Russia inquiry after failing to disclose a meeting with the Kremlin's envoy during his confirmation hearing. Mr Sessions, known for his hardline anti-immigration stance, was one of then-candidate Mr Trump's earliest supporters in Washington. Earlier this week, Mr Trump said he was \"disappointed\" with Mr Sessions, tweeting that he had \"taken a VERY weak position\" on the investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. In an interview with the New York Times, the president expressed regret about appointing Mr Sessions, adding he \"should have never recused himself\". Anthony Scaramucci, the president's new communications director, fuelled the fire on Tuesday by suggesting the attorney general's days could be numbered. Mr Graham on Wednesday said \"there will be holy hell to pay\" if Mr Sessions is fired, warning that there would be \"no confirmation for a new attorney general in 2017\". \"This is not just a diversion, this is unnerving,\" he told reporters. \"It's unfair to Jeff Sessions, he's a good man who deserves better, and some of the suggestions the president is making go way beyond what's acceptable.\"", "abstract": "US Senator Lindsey Graham has said he is drafting legislation to stop any attempt by the Trump administration to fire Russia investigator Bob Mueller.", "candidate": "US Senator Lindsey Graham is introducing legislation to protect special counsel Robert Mueller from being fired.", "doc_id": 1731, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "There's no telling if Lindsey Graham's legislation insulating the independent counsel Robert Mueller from Donald Trump's wrath will go anywhere.", "explanation": "The legislation hasn't passed so is just an introduction, which is what this was.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

{"article": "The national chain, based in Langholm, is accused of committing the offence on two occasions in 2014. A trial began at Dumfries Sheriff Court last month but reporting restrictions prevented publicity. Lawyers for the company argued it could have affected witnesses and voiced concerns about the business impact but the ban has now been overturned. The alleged offences, brought under the Textile Products Regulations 2012, are said to have taken place at the company's store in Church Place, Dumfries, one of 265 high street shops. When the trial began at Dumfries Sheriff Court on 15 September, Susan Duff QC, for the accused, argued against an application on behalf of the BBC and ITV Border to revoke the ban, arguing that publicity could affect the evidence of witnesses who are yet to come to court. She also said: \"The accused has a legitimate concern about its business and employees. \"Now is the busiest time of year for the purchase of cashmere.\" She said reporting that scarves were not 100% cashmere could be \"prejudicial to the legitimate interests\" of the firm. But Ronnie Clancy QC, for the BBC, argued that this being \"the busiest time of year for Christmas orders\" was simply a reputational issue, not covered by the Contempt of Court Act under which the ban was made. Sheriff George Jamieson agreed to revoke the interim order he had previously made, and allowed the case to be reported. Previously, Alison Irving, 52, a trading standards officer at Dumfries and Galloway Council, told the court she had test purchased a blue tartan scarf in February 2014 and a red one four months later. Both scarves were reduced to \u00c2\u00a330 from \u00c2\u00a360 and were labelled as 100% Lochmere cashmere, the court heard. Ms Irving later cut the scarves into pieces, bagged and sealed them and sent them off to be analysed at two different test labs - SGS UK and Intertek UK. It emerged that she was acting on information from the Cashmere and Camelhair Manufacturers Institute (CCMI). On receiving reports back from the test labs, Ms Irving said she sent a letter in August 2014 cautioning EWM. She said she notified the business that one scarf had been found to contain 84.4% cashmere, while the other was found to have 61.6% cashmere, with the remainder made up of other wool fibres. Under cross-examination from Ms Duff, the witness said it was \"odd\" that the results received back from each of the labs had been different from each other. \"They were different from each other but neither said they were 100%,\" she said. The witness confirmed that after sending EWM a sample, the company sent back results from another test lab showing that both scarves were found to be 100% cashmere. Ms Duff also challenged the evidence of a textile analyst Liqin Zhang who gave evidence saying she identified wool and yak in the scarf samples. Ms Duff told Ms Zhang that EWM had sent a DNA tested 100% cashmere sample for her to analyse in August 2016. The lawyer said the fabric had been subject to the same processes and dyed the same colour as the red scarf sample previously tested. Ms Duff told Ms Zhang: \"You identified that 100% cashmere sample as 85% cashmere and 15% unidentifiable fibres. \"The issue is with your identification and not with the product, isn't it?\" Ms Zhang replied: \"If the fibre structure is damaged I have to report it as unidentifiable, I can't just guess.\" Ms Duff continued: \"You couldn't identify fibres that were 100% cashmere, that's down to your ability?\" Ms Zhang replied: \"That's my decision on what my observation is. I'm not saying I'm perfect.\" The trial continues.", "abstract": "Edinburgh Woollen Mill has denied a charge of mislabelling scarves as 100% cashmere in a store in Dumfries.", "candidate": "A sheriff has lifted a ban on reporting the trial of retailer EWM, accused of falsely claiming cashmere scarves were 100% cashmere.", "doc_id": 1346, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "The Dumfries Sheriff Court has lifted a ban on reporting the trial of retailer EWM, accused of falsely claiming cashmere scarves were 100% cashmere.", "evidence": "A trial began at Dumfries Sheriff Court last month but reporting restrictions prevented publicity.", "explanation": "The summary states the ban was lifted by the sheriff but the source text indicates the ban was lifted by the Dumfries Sheriff Court.", "instruction": "Replace the information about A sheriff with the information about The Dumfries Sheriff Court.", "instruction_list": ["Replace the information about A sheriff with the information about The Dumfries Sheriff Court."]}}
{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device . Off-spinner JP Duminy took a hat-trick and leg-spinner Imran Tahir 4-26 as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 133. The Proteas then eased to their target for the loss of only one wicket in 18 overs, with Quinton de Kock making an unbeaten 78. They go on to a last-four meeting with New Zealand or West Indies in Auckland on Tuesday. South Africa's first knockout victory in 23 years of playing World Cup cricket takes them to a first semi-final since a famous defeat by Australia in 1999. In reaching their target with 32 overs to spare, AB de Villiers' side also completed the fastest successful run chase in a World Cup knockout match as Sri Lanka, finalists in the previous two World Cups, wilted. Their lacklustre display was not befitting what turned out to be the final international match for Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara's last ODI. The duo have scored 117 international centuries between them. After the Proteas' pace bowlers made early inroads, the spin pair of Duminy and Tahir took advantage of a succession of loose shots, while South Africa were excellent in the field throughout. Sangakkara, on the back of four successive hundreds, made a painstaking 45 and Lahiru Thirimanne a counter-attacking 41, but no other batsman reached 20. To cap South Africa's day, wicketkeeper De Kock, who had managed only 53 runs in his six previous innings, returned to form with a string of cover drives. Still, their victory was built on a brilliant bowling performance after losing the toss on an excellent pitch. New-ball pair Kyle Abbott and Dale Steyn took the edges of Kusal Perera and Tillakaratne Dilshan respectively before Sangakkara and Thirimanne steadied with stand of 65. While Thirimanne was fluent through the off side, Sangakkara was stodgy, taking 16 balls to get off the mark and, at one point, having six from 42 balls. When Thirimanne became the first of the seven wickets to fall to spin, Sangakkara was forced to watch from the other end as the middle and lower order fell around him. With the ball holding in the pitch, Thirimanne patted back to Tahir and Jayawardene lobbed the same bowler to short mid-wicket. Duminy, filling the fifth bowler slot which has caused South Africa problems during the tournament, then got to work to become the first Proteas player to take a World Cup hat-trick. Media playback is not supported on this device . Angelo Mathews was caught at mid-on and, in Duminy's next over, Nuwan Kulasekara feathered behind before debutant Tharindu Kaushal was pinned leg before. For 19-year-old Kaushal, it was a golden duck on his ODI debut having being added to the Sri Lanka squad on the morning of the match. Sangakkara was left to play a lone hand, but his attempt at aggression was ended with a slash to third man off Morne Morkel. He departed with 14,234 runs, a tally second only to Sachin Tendulkar, in 404 matches. This was the 150th one-dayer in which he batted with Jayawardene, who has 12,650 runs.

Essex fast bowler David Masters told BBC Radio Essex: . \"I'm getting a bit older now and can't play as many games, so when I am playing I'm generally fresh. They've looked after me well this year. I've played when they've needed me to play and hopefully I don't disappoint. \"My body takes a bit more of a battering now and it takes me a bit more time to recover. But I still love playing, I love bowling. \"It's quite a docile wicket actually. The shine came off the new-ball and it started to swing and I got the ball in the right areas. That can happen sometimes.\" Worcestershire assistant coach Matt Mason told BBC Hereford & Worcester: . \"We probably lacked a bit of application with the bat, particularly early on with some soft dismissals in there. And that last session was probably the poorest we have had as a bowling unit this year, so not an ideal day. \"When you win the toss and bat first you want to post 400, let's be honest. It looked a good surface and if we'd applied ourselves better you could bat and get some good partnerships. \"I wouldn't want to detract anything from Masters' spell. He did what he's done for his whole career - he put the ball on the spot and nagged away.

{"article": "The British star had been expected to be up for lead actor after winning a Golden Globe for his work. Olivia Colman and Hugh Laurie were also passed over for their roles in the BBC drama, although Tom Hollander was recognised for best supporting actor. Netflix's royal series The Crown leads the way with five nods, including best drama and lead actress for Claire Foy. Damilola, Our Loved Boy - about the murdered schoolboy Damilola Taylor - receives three nominations, as do Fleabag and Happy Valley. See the full nominations list . The Crown is the main beneficiary of a rule change that means shows can be nominated in the main categories if they have mainly British talent, but haven't been made for a British broadcaster. That means the field is even more competitive than before, according to Bafta chair Jane Lush - which is one factor explaining why The Night Manager has missed out. \"There is so much investment in drama now that the competition is incredibly fierce,\" she said. Bafta juries have more big shows to consider when settling on the shortlists, she said. \"Whereas a few years ago people were choosing four [nominees] out of six contenders for drama series, they're now probably looking at 10 or even more. \"So it has just got increasingly competitive when the awards season comes around.\" Robbie Coltrane has been nominated for his fifth Bafta TV award for his role as a comedian accused of historic sex crimes in Channel 4's National Treasure. His competition includes Benedict Cumberbatch, up for his role as Richard III in The Hollow Crown: The Wars of the Roses. Foy's fellow contenders in the leading actress category include Happy Valley's Sarah Lancashire and Nikki Amuka-Bird, recognised for her work in the BBC's adaptation of Zadie Smith's NW. Happy Valley is up for best drama series alongside The Crown, as are ITV's The Durrells and the BBC's War and Peace. But there is no room in that category for The Night Manager - despite it being shortlisted for six Bafta Craft Awards last month. Nor is there a space for Coronation Street in the soap and continuing drama category, where preference has been given to Casualty, EastEnders, Emmerdale and Hollyoaks. Colman may not have been recognised for The Night Manager, but she is up for best female comedy performance for her role in BBC Three's Fleabag. Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the show's creator, is nominated alongside her in that category, while the show is also up for best scripted comedy. Foy, who was up for lead actress last year for Wolf Hall, receives her second nomination in consecutive years, this time for playing the young Queen Elizabeth II. Three of her co-stars in The Crown - Jared Harris, John Lithgow and Vanessa Kirby - are also recognised, for playing King George VI, Winston Churchill and Princess Margaret respectively. Strictly Come Dancing is nominated for best entertainment programme, with an additional nomination for Claudia Winkleman for best entertainment performance.

{"article": "Events are taking place in Dublin to mark the centenary of the 1916 rebellion against British rule, a seminal moment in Ireland's past. Some unionists have been reluctant to take part in or support the events. Michael D Higgins also said the commemorations are an example to the UK of how to reflect on its own history. The Easter Rising, a brief and militarily unsuccessful republican revolt, is seen by many historians as a significant stepping-stone in the eventual creation of the Republic of Ireland and the partition of the island. A greater depth of knowledge, President Higgins said, meant the Easter Rising was now being put \"in context of what was happening in Europe\" 100 years ago. \"I do think that without 1916, and the events that surrounded it, we would not have achieved our independence,\" he said in a wide-ranging interview for the BBC. \"It is one of the founding events, without a doubt, and it is of immense significance in terms of where it occurs historically but also symbolically.\" President Higgins said Ireland's approach to the rising's centenary was one of \"ethical sensitivity\". And he added that \"it is responsible not to be seeing fears where there are none\". \"My great hope, as head of state, is that we will put ourselves into each other's history,\" he said. \"We must be able to take your version, my version, move into the shoes of the other, and we must be open to changing our versions as new facts, information and analysis become available to us. \"I would hope that people in Northern Ireland will approach these commemorations, and as we commemorate the [Battle of the] Somme, that we'd be able to do so generously.\" President Higgins said people must not \"become a prisoner of the past\" and \"mustn't allow any distortions of history\". He said everyone's take on history must be open to critique, and that Britain, like Ireland, had to closely examine its past. \"When we decide to address the issue of violence, let us speak of the violence of empire, the violence of state, the violence of insurrection,\" he said. \"Let's do it all - this is the challenge that people are not rising to. \"Having spent decades revising nationalism, where is the evidence that there is as much energy put into addressing the issue of empire? \"As empires came to establishing their stamp on neighbouring countries, what was the consequences of that?\" He described the Northern Ireland peace process as \"fragile\" and an \"ongoing project\", but added it would be \"pessimistic and wrong\" to say significant reconciliation had not been achieved. \"There is real reconciliation going on,\" he said. \"You don't keep picking at the sources of division to undermine what progress you're making in the present in terms of reconciliation.\" Earlier this week, the Inniskillings Museum in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, presented President Higgins with a green harp flag that had been taken by a soldier from Dublin's Liberty Hall during the rising.", "abstract": "The Irish president has said he hopes people in Northern Ireland will approach the Easter Rising commemorations \"generously\".", "candidate": "The Republic of Ireland would not have achieved its independence without the Easter Rising, the country's president has said.", "doc_id": 1821, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "\"I do think that without 1916, and the events that surrounded it, we would not have achieved our independence,\" he said in a wide-ranging interview for the BBC.", "explanation": "The summary is correct because the source text supports that the President is who said the Republic of Ireland would not have achieved independence without Easter Rising.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

She is mother to Caileb, 13, Noah, nine, Brooke, eight, and Jesse, 15 months.

She has made memory boxes for each of them and kept a journal for them to pore over. Mrs Lennox was 34 and pregnant with her youngest child when she was told she had breast cancer. Initial worries centred around the wellbeing of her unborn baby, who was born by emergency C-section at 30 weeks. \"He was a little sleeping beauty after all of my chemotherapy,\" she said. \"He was safe because I had a reduced dose of the treatment, but it was decided that he had to come out early. \"Little Jesse was 3lb when he was born and his lungs were underdeveloped, but he fought to full health. \"I completed my treatment and life returned to pretty much normal.\" But after fighting off the disease once, it was to return in January this year. The cancer has now spread to Mrs Lennox's lungs, and her prognosis is not good. \"I am preparing to die,\" she told BBC News NI. \"It may sound morbid and I try not to make things too sad, but I believe it's important that the children know I won't be around forever. \"During my first round of treatment, I explained to them that I was sick and had to take medicine, but when it returned I knew I had to be more honest about the future. \"I've always been the type of mother who wants to protect her kids and to hide them from anything too upsetting. \"But now they know I won't be around to see them grown up and that I'm not going to get better. \"Obviously I was devastated when I got the news - it's not something any mother would want, but life can be taken away from you by cancer at any age. \"I don't have long left, but the kids get to go through some of the sadness they have ahead with me there to comfort them.\" As well as the memory boxes and leaving each child advice for the future, Mrs Lennox has been planning her funeral. \"I've sorted the grave, chosen my own coffin, written my eulogy and chosen the readings and hymns,\" she said. \"It's a strange experience, but my husband Alistair, 42, will have the four kids to look after when I'm gone, he doesn't need the stress of organising the funeral too.\" Mrs Lennox said she will make her final preparations in the coming days and then put it all to the side in order to spend the time she has left with her family. \"Christmas is my favourite time of year, so although I may not be there this year, we are going to make decorations together to hang around the house,\" she said.

{"article": "The study by Duke Health in the US and published in the New England Journal of Medicine looked at 4,274 babies born between 22 and 24 weeks. Compared with those born a decade earlier, a larger percentage were now toddlers without signs of moderate or severe cognitive and motor delay. Changes to care are being credited with the improvement. About 30% of children included in the study who were born between the years 2000 and 2003 survived, but that rate increased to 36% for babies born in 2008 to 2011.

{"article": "South Africa's Equality Court fined Jon Qwelane $14,450 (\u00c2\u00a38,920) and ordered him to apologise for promoting hatred in the column published in 2008. Headlined \"Call me names but gay is NOT OKAY\", it caused an uproar at the time. Mr Qwelane, who was appointed last year to Uganda where homosexual acts are illegal, did not mount a defence. Correspondents say the outcome of the case is particularly significant in the light of the recent attacks and rapes of lesbian women in South Africa. Unlike in many African countries, homosexual acts are legal in South Africa and discrimination based on sexual orientation is banned, but activists say gay and lesbian people are often attacked in townships. \"We are hoping really that this finding will send a message to community members, a message that says gay and lesbian people have an equal right to the protection of their dignity,\" said Vincent Moaga, spokesman for the South African Human Rights Commission, which initiated the complaint against Mr Qwelane. The Sunday Sun officially apologised for the column following complaints after its publication, but Mr Qwelane refused to make an apology. The court agreed with commission's argument that Mr Qwelane's article, and the cartoon accompanying it, had promoted hatred against homosexuals, causing them emotional suffering. Mr Moaga said the money from the fine would be donated to gay rights organisations. The BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg says Mr Qwelane was appointed as ambassador last year, raising concerns that he would fuel tensions in Uganda which has come under intense international pressure over plans to tighten laws against homosexuality. The Anti-Homosexuality Bill, first introduced in 2009 and yet to be voted on in Uganda's parliament, seeks to increase the penalties for homosexual acts from 14 years in prison to life. It also proposes the death penalty for a new offence of \"aggravated homosexuality\" - defined as when one of the participants is a minor, HIV-positive, disabled or a \"serial offender\".", "abstract": "The South African ambassador to Uganda, a former columnist for South Africa's Sunday Sun paper, has been found guilty of hate speech for an anti-gay article.", "candidate": "The Ugandan ambassador to South Africa has been found guilty of hate speech for a column in the Sunday Sun newspaper.", "doc_id": 1578, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Jon Qwelane has been found guilty of hate speech for a column in the Sunday Sun newspaper.", "evidence": "South Africa's Equality Court fined Jon Qwelane $14,450 (\u00c2\u00a38,920) and ordered him to apologise for promoting hatred in the column published in 2008.", "explanation": "The source text does not mention Jon Qwelane's job title.", "instruction": "Replace the information about Jon Qwelane's job title with the information about Jon Qwelane's name.", "instruction_list": ["Replace the information about Jon Qwelane's job title with the information about Jon Qwelane's name."]}}

{"article": "Simon Brown, 24, from East Grinstead, West Sussex, hit his head on a signal gantry on 7 August. The hearing in London was told that passenger Kirstin Duffield heard a \"loud thud\". In a statement read by the coroner, she said she found Mr Brown with an injury that was \"not survivable\". The train from Gatwick to London Victoria was travelling at about 60mph when the incident happened near Balham, south London. Mark Young, from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB), told the hearing Mr Brown's head was out of the window with no evidence to indicate why. He said Mr Brown suffered a fatal head injury as a result of striking a signal gantry. Ms Duffield said she saw Mr Brown had collapsed in the corridor after she stood up from her seat, but saw he was still breathing. \"There was a lot of blood on the floor and around his head. There was a massive trauma to the top of his head,\" she said. She said it became apparent there was nothing she could do for him. The inquest heard Ms Duffield got off the train at Wandsworth Common after the alarm was raised and the driver had been alerted. She said she saw \"blood splatter\" on the outside of the carriage, but had not seen Mr Brown with his head out of the window. Mr Brown's mother, Jane Street, said her son had a passion for railways and \"was neither reckless nor ignorant of the dangers of that environment\". In a statement, she said her son first volunteered on the Bluebell Railway as a nine-year-old and had recently become an engineering technician with Hitachi Rail Europe in Bristol. Mr Brown's father, Mike Brown, said his son had been due to move in with his girlfriend and he had \"never seen him so relaxed, happy and enthusiastic about his future\". Questioned about findings by the RAIB, Mr Young said the distance between the window and gantry was found to be 26cm while the train was static. He said it complied with standards for existing structures but was less than an industry-recommended minimum for new structures. He also said it had been found the distance between the gantry and a moving carriage could have been as little as 68mm. He said the window opposite the guard's compartment was not intended for passenger use, although it was accessible to anyone on the train and open when the train left Gatwick. A yellow sticker on the door warning people not to lean out of the window was \"in a rather cluttered environment\" among many other signs, he noted.

The DUP's Junior Minister, Alastair Ross, is also attending. However, Sinn F\u00e9in has accused the government of treating the council as a \"talking shop\". Earlier this week, Prime Minister Theresa May said Brexit means leaving the European Customs Union. It currently allows tariff and paperwork-free trade between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Sinn F\u00e9in MLA John O'Dowd said on Thursday: \"By making her so-called keynote speech on Brexit... this week two days ahead of the Joint Ministerial Council, British Prime Minister Theresa May treated the council with utter disdain.\" He added: \"That was a clear act of bad faith... it is clear she is intent on ignoring the will of the majority of people in the north who voted to remain in the EU. \"It has got to the stage where the Joint Ministerial Council is being treated as a talking shop by the British government and we will be reassessing our involvement with it.\" The DUP see the council as a useful forum to air their concerns. The DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in were joined at the council meeting by ministers from Scotland and Wales. Northern Ireland Office minister Lord Dunlop described the talks as \"a constructive session in looking at the devolved administrations' important contribution to the process of planning the UK's departure from the European Union\". \"In her speech this week, the prime minister emphasised the importance of working together to achieve a deal that works for Northern Ireland as part of a United Kingdom that is determined to take advantage of the opportunities that leaving the EU presents,\" he said. Earlier, Mr Hazzard said Northern Ireland needed a \"special designated status\" within the EU. Former Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) John Bruton has said Mrs May's plan for a post-Brexit customs deal will be \"unworkable\". Sinn F\u00e9in has said exiting the European Customs Union creates a \"hard border on the island of Ireland\". But DUP MP Sammy Wilson said the prime minister's statement would give the business community \"more certainty\". Brexit Secretary David Davis has said the UK leaving the EU would result in difficulties over border controls on the island of Ireland, but that any problems could be solved. What is a customs union and why does it matter? A customs union is a form of trade agreement between two or more countries. It means they decide not to impose tariffs (taxes on imports) on each other's goods and agree to impose common external tariffs on goods from countries outside their customs union. Setting common external tariffs is what distinguishes a customs union from a free trade area. The key argument for leaving the customs union is that it will allow the UK to negotiate its own trade agreements.

The PM's official spokesman said the welfare system was a \"strong safety net for those who are in need of it\". Meanwhile, a No 10 aide apologised for any offence after saying benefits should go to \"really disabled people\". No 10 policy unit head George Freeman had faced calls to apologise after saying on Sunday those \"taking pills at home, who suffer from anxiety\" should not receive Personal Independence Payments. On Monday he tweeted: \"Having experienced myself traumatic anxiety as a child carer living w alcohol I know all too well the pain anxiety + depression causes... \"Which is why as a former health minister and policy adviser I am passionate about supporting mental health and disability, and hugely regret if my comment about the need to prioritise the most 'serious disabilities' inadvertently caused any offence which was not intended.\" The prime minister's official spokesman said the Personal Independence Payments (PIP) reforms were not about saving money and said that about \u00c2\u00a350bn a year was spent on supporting people with disabilities and health conditions. \"The government has been clear on the parity of esteem we want to see between mental and physical health,\" the spokesman said. \"What we are doing now is restoring the original intention of the PIPs which was to make sure there was a sustainable benefit to provide continued support to those who face the greatest barrier to living independent lives.\" Pressed on whether the prime minister had a message for those who could be affected by the changes, the spokesman said \"nobody is losing out\". He said a recent tribunal on assessments for PIP payments had \"broadened\" the criteria. The government is proposing changes to PIPs, which replaced the Disability Living Allowance, after tribunal rulings that claimants with psychological problems who cannot travel without help must be treated like those who are blind. The government says the rulings - if unchallenged - would have added \u00c2\u00a33.7bn to the benefits bill by 2023. The benefit is intended to help people cope with the extra costs of living with ill health or disability and are made according to the points a person scores in an assessment of their needs. Disabilities minister Penny Mordaunt said she was reforming the PIP payments to \"restore the original aim of the benefit\" to make sure support was given to the most needy.

{"article": "So far most of the ground troops deployed are there to protect the airbase, but satellite evidence suggests that at least two other Syrian bases are being prepared to receive additional Russian troops. The Russian build-up is being closely monitored - not least by the Israelis, who have been flying intelligence-gathering aircraft off the coast between Cyprus and Lebanon on a regular circuit. Most of the information available to the media comes from images from civil satellites, but of course US military satellites will also be watching developments, seeking any detail that might give a hint of Russian intentions. Imagery analysts will be looking for evidence of weapons stores; of munitions being loaded on to aircraft or for any other signs of jets being prepared for operational sorties. The electromagnetic spectrum will also be monitored from Western bases in Cyprus and from Israel, where the military has no shortage of Russian speakers. Reports suggest that some of the Russian aircraft have already been undertaking familiarisation flights in Syrian airspace. But the question remains - what will Moscow do next? Is this all preliminary to a direct Russian intervention in the fighting? Or is this something else - military theatre on a grand scale to achieve wider diplomatic objectives? What President Vladimir Putin appears to be doing in Syria is to use at least the threat of military force to pursue his wider diplomatic goals. To see what is going on, one must pull back from the close-up images of Russian warplanes on the tarmac and look at the wider diplomatic picture. Russia - isolated and confronting Western sanctions due to its behaviour in Ukraine - is genuinely concerned about the rise of Islamist fundamentalism, which threatens to spread ever closer to Russia's own borders. It wants to see the so-called Islamic State defeated and some order restored in Syria, where it has long maintained a strategic interest. It believes Western policy in the region has been self-serving and wildly naive. Existing regimes have been toppled leaving little more than chaos in their wake. With the UN General Assembly in New York fast approaching, Mr Putin is eager to embark upon a new initiative on the world stage; one that will highlight Russia's distinctive voice, but one that also will underline what he sees as Moscow's irreplaceable role in the international system. So seen in this light, the Russian deployment to Syria may already have achieved much of what Mr Putin is seeking. For a start Russia has demonstrated that it is a strategic player in the region and is prepared to put its military might behind its diplomacy. It has also demonstrated that its support for President Bashar al-Assad, at least for the short- and medium-term, is solid and a factor with which all other actors must contend. On the purely diplomatic front, the US has reopened military talks with Moscow. Mr Putin is due to meet President Barack Obama shortly - an encounter that will have been highly unlikely if Ukraine alone was top of their agenda. Even more significantly, key actors like the Americans and some of their Nato allies, have altered their rhetoric. They are now careful to speak about Mr Assad having no \"long-term\" role in Syria - leaving open what might happen in the short- and medium-term. There are certainly risks in Mr Putin's military gamble in Syria. But there are clearly opportunities for Russia too. And that is what Mr Putin is counting upon.", "abstract": "With some 24 strike- and close-support aircraft and about a dozen attack helicopters on the ground at its new airbase outside Latakia, Russia is poised to be able to make a significant impact on the fighting in Syria if it so wishes.", "candidate": "Russia's military build-up in Syria is being closely watched.", "doc_id": 2863, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "The Russian build-up is being closely monitored - not least by the Israelis, who have been flying intelligence-gathering aircraft off the coast between Cyprus and Lebanon on a regular circuit.", "explanation": "The source agrees that the build-up is being monitored and also goes on to say it's showing evidence of Russians sending more troops into Syrian bases.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

Recent data has suggested that China's economic growth continues to slow down. As well as the volatility in Chinese shares, there are fears of a protracted effect on demand for commodities. China's slowdown is expected to pull down other regional economies, affecting energy and raw material consumption. The unstable Chinese market has also led to worries that the problems in the world's second largest economy may have far-reaching global consequences. China's benchmark Shanghai Composite index on Monday shed as much as 8%, while markets in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Sydney all dropped by more than 4%. On Friday, figures showed China's factory activity in August shrank at its fastest pace in more than six years. Official figures have indicated that China's economic growth is continuing to slow. For the three months to the end of July, the economy grew by 7% compared with a year earlier - its slowest pace since 2009. Bernard Aw, market strategist with trading firm IG, said given the tepid demand, it was hard to fathom why oil producers were pumping out more crude. Opec producers, notably Saudi Arabia, and Iraq were producing more oil than necessary, while US stockpiles were nearly 100 million barrels above the five-year seasonal average. \"At this rate, the fundamentals of oil are going to get worse before it gets better as the supply glut widens. This means we are likely to see more weakness in oil futures in the coming sessions,\" Mr Aw said. Oil dealers are also anticipating revised US economic growth data for the second quarter, to be released on Thursday.

City and Guilds managing director Kirstie Donnelly said it was \"worrying\" to see the figures \"creep up after months of more positive news\". The Office of National Statistics figures date back to October to December 2001 when 833,000 young people were classified as NEET, some 12.9% of the total age-group. At the end of last year that proportion had fallen to 11.8%. NEET numbers reached from highs of over a million, or more than 16% of the age-group, in 2011, but have fallen consistently since. In England, the government raised the education participation age to 17 in September 2013 and to 18 in September 2015. So young people in England are now expected to stay in full-time education, in an apprenticeship, or in employment with training until they are 18. The UK-wide NEET figures first dropped below the million mark, to 987,000, or 13.5% of the age group in the first quarter of 2014. England-only figures show there were 690,000 NEETs at the end of last year, almost 100,000 fewer than in the last quarter of 2014. This figure is the lowest since 2000 when comparable records began and the number stood at 629,000, says the government.

{"article": "Two of them did not march to police lines at the junction of Woodvale Road and Woodvale Parade on 12 July, the point at which the Parades Commission said the parade must stop. In the previous three years, the Orange Order arrived in force, with hundreds of members, supporters and bandsmen. But, on Tuesday, fewer than 20 members of Ballysillan lodge, and a small number of supporters, arrived at a police barrier erected across the road. They clearly expected the other lodges to join them, and waited for an hour and a quarter for them to do so. The assembled media were told repeatedly by Orange, loyalist and police sources that Ligoniel True Blues and the Earl of Erne lodges were on their way. But they never came. At 20:30 BST, looking visibly frustrated, members of Ballysillan LOL 1891 walked away from police lines and dispersed. The lodge and the Orange Order have since rejected any suggestion it was deliberately left out on a limb for opposing a deal with a nationalist residents' group in Ardoyne to end the parade dispute. The proposed deal collapsed earlier this month after Ballysillan made it clear it would not back it, while the others said they would. Gerald Solinas, a spokesman for Ballysillan, said it was simply because the other lodges would not have made it to the police barrier before the 20:30 BST cut-off point imposed by the parades commission. The Orange Order has backed this claim and insisted what happened was not the result of a deliberate decision to isolate Ballysillan. But the BBC has established that a deliberate decision was taken to keep the three lodges apart. There are more than 100 lodges within Belfast County Grand Lodge . Each of them is a member of one of nine districts. Traditionally all lodges within each district walk together. However, that has not happened in north Belfast since this disputed parade was prevented from completing its return leg past the Ardoyne shop fronts in July 2013. Since then, the three lodges involved in the dispute have marched together in solidarity, despite being members of different districts. Ballysillan LOL 1891 is member of District Number Three, Ligoniel True Blues LOL 1932 part of Number One, and the Earl of Erne LOL 647 is a member of District Number Four. In the three previous years the lodges were given special allowances by their governing body, Belfast County Grand Lodge, to walk together close to the head of the Twelfth parade. That changed this year. Instead, the lodges decided they would parade as part of their own districts, and not together. Each year one of the districts leads the parade. This year it was the turn of District Number Three, so Ballysillan helped lead the way. The other districts then followed in numerical order, with the Earl of Erne, District Number Four, directly behind them. Districts five, six, seven, eight and nine then followed, before going back to District Number One, which meant Ligoneil was towards the back of the parade. The Orange Order claim that the Earl of Erne and Ligoneil decided to disperse early because they ran out of time and could not make the police barriers before the 20:30 BST deadline imposed by the Parades Commission. That might stand up to scrutiny if both of the other lodges were together at the back of the parade. But they weren't. So how could it be that Ballysillan, which is part of District Number Three, reached the barrier on the Woodvale Road at 19:15 BST, while a lodge in the district immediately behind them could not make it an hour and a quarter later? An Orange Order source says members of the Earl of Erne lodge decided to wait for Ligoniel True Blues before walking to the police lines. That means they took a conscious decision not to join Ballysillan. Whatever the Order might say, that decision, and the decision by Belfast County Grand Lodge not to have three north Belfast lodges march together this year, resulted in Ballysillan appearing to be isolated, with little support.", "abstract": "Tuesday marked the first time since a stand-off over a disputed Orange Order parade in Belfast started in July 2013, that the three lodges involved have not spoken with one voice.", "candidate": "Three lodges involved in a long-running Twelfth of July dispute in north Belfast did not march together on Tuesday night, the BBC has learned.", "doc_id": 3645, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Three lodges in north Belfast did not march together on Tuesday night, the BBC has learned.", "evidence": "But the BBC has established that a deliberate decision was taken to keep the three lodges apart.", "explanation": "the original summary adds unsupported info about the dispute being \"long-running\" and also misinterprets what the source text says about a July dispute.", "instruction": "Remove the information about a long-running Twelfth of July dispute from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about a long-running Twelfth of July dispute from the summary."]}}

Mr Coyne, the union's West Midlands secretary, launched his campaign for the top job in Birmingham. Unite is Labour's biggest donor and Mr McCluskey has been one of leader Jeremy Corbyn's key backers in the face of opposition from some MPs. Mr McCluskey has already announced plans to resign as general secretary but to stand again for the position, a move which brings forward the election by a year. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Coyne's challenge would be seen by the Labour leader's allies as a political attack. She added that Mr Coyne was understood to be concerned about Mr Corbyn's anti-Trident stance given that thousands of Unite members work in the defence industry. Announcing his candidacy on his Facebook page, Mr Coyne, who has worked for the union for more than 20 years having joined as a shop worker at Sainsbury's, said: \"I believe our union needs to be changed so we can get on with the only job that matters; protecting and defending our members at work.\" \"We have got to be strong, smart and organised but we can't be distracted party politics. \"As a candidate, my priority is making a real difference for you rather than playing Westminster power games.

{"article": "It is claimed the accounts for the Cleddau Bridge are confusing, with some showing a loss and others a profit. Motorists pay 75p - lorry drivers \u00a31.50 - to cross between Pembroke Dock and Neyland. There have been previous calls to scrap the tolls altogether. The council said it will review both the physical and financial management of the bridge. The announcement follows a complaint from a member of the public to the Wales Audit Office, which argued that money collected by the council was not being spent in line with rules governing the bridge. The complaint also suggested that council accounts for the bridge are confusing. One set of Pembrokeshire council figures for 2013/14 show the bridge operation made a loss of \u00a360.6m. A second set of figures for the same period suggest the loss was \u00a39.3m. And a third set of figures state that the council actually made a combined surplus of \u00a317.6m. Council officials have confirmed to BBC Wales that \u00a360m deficit is in fact a 'notional' loss - and does not actually exist. The second part of the complaint to auditors is over whether the council should be allowed to make a profit - and where that money should be spent. Collecting tolls on the Cleddau Bridge is governed by legislation set out by the UK Parliament in the Dyfed Act 1987.

{"article": "Supermarket worker David Sinclair, 34, shook his five-month-old son Joshua in a fit of anger, causing him to die at Hairmyres Hospital hours later. At the High Court in Glasgow, Sinclair pleaded guilty to culpable homicide in regard to the infant's death on 6 December, 2012. He is due to return to the court for sentencing next month. Sinclair was originally charged with murder, but admitted the reduced charge of culpable homicide, just days before he was due to go on trial. Prosecutor Ashley Edwards said that on the day the child died, Sinclair and his now wife Kirsty and Joshua went swimming and then shopping in East Kilbride. At 17:30 Kirsty Sinclair went out to meet her mother and sister. Just 11 minutes later she received a phone call from Sinclair, who sounded \"shocked\". He told her: \"Joshua isn't breathing properly, come home right away.\" He then hung up and dialled 999. The court heard that Kirsty Sinclair, who is pregnant, married Sinclair on the anniversary of their son's first birthday on 9 July 2013, and had said she was standing by him. Initially the cause of Joshua's death was unascertained, but the case was reviewed by a team of medical experts who discovered evidence of trauma in the eyes and brain which could only have been caused non-accidentally close to the time of death. One of the experts, Dr Peter Richards, consultant paediatric neuro-surgeon at John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, said: \"This would be compatible with him having suffered a shaking injury involving handling at greater force than encountered in everyday life. \"It would be compatible with a shaking event where a carer, who has not planned to injure a child, has a momentary loss of control with tragic consequences.\" Defending QC, Ian Duguid, told the court that Sinclair had found it \"unimaginable\" that the handling of his child would have resulted in such catastrophic injuries. The barrister added: \"He is extremely remorseful for the events which have ensued. Witnesses in double figures would have come forward to talk of his caring abilities as a parent.\" Det Ch Insp Laura McLuckie, who was the senior investigating officer in the case, said: \"David Sinclair admitted to being responsible for the death of his baby son, Joshua, who died needlessly at a young and vulnerable age. \"My sincere condolences go out to Joshua's extended family, who have endured this harrowing incident and continue to live with the pain of Joshua's untimely death. \"A defenceless baby died at the hands of his father, the one person whose role was to protect and care for him.\"", "abstract": "A man has admitted killing his baby son in a \"harrowing incident\" at his home in East Kilbride.", "candidate": "A man has admitted shaking his baby son to death in East Kilbride.", "doc_id": 1119, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "A man has admitted shaking his baby son to death near East Kilbride.", "evidence": "Prosecutor Ashley Edwards said that on the day the child died, Sinclair and his now wife Kirsty and Joshua went swimming and then shopping in East Kilbride.", "explanation": "The summary specifies the baby was killed in East Kibride but the article mentions specifically only that the family had shopped that day in East Kibride.", "instruction": "Modify the information about in East Kilbride to near East Kilbride. in the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Modify the information about in East Kilbride to near East Kilbride. in the summary."]}}

Tesco will retain an 8.3% holding in the South East Asia-focused business. The move comes the day before Tesco's annual results, in which it is expected to announce further disposals. The supermarket group is planning to sell off some of its side businesses, including Dobbies Garden Centres chain, coffee shop chain Harris & Hoole and restaurant chain Giraffe, so that it can focus on the main supermarket business, according to media reports. Last September, Tesco sold its South Korean business, Homeplus, for \u00a34.2bn to help shore up its balance sheet and revitalise its UK business. There has been speculation about possible disposals since chief executive Dave Lewis took the helm in September 2014, charged with reviving the group's fortunes. Mr Lewis was parachuted in after the supermarket reported it had overstated its profits by some \u00a3263m. Alongside this, like its \"big four\" peers - Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - Tesco has been hit by competition from discount rivals Lidl and Aldi. The UK has also seen a broad change in shopping habits, with many customers preferring to shop little and often at small convenience stores, instead of doing a once-a-week \"big shop\". In April last year, the company reported a record pre-tax loss of \u00a36.4bn for the year to February, marking the biggest loss reported to date by a British retailer. Mr Lewis has focused on price cuts and putting more staff in stores in an attempt to revive sales.

{"article": "Scientists are recruiting 64 healthy adult volunteers for the trial, which is expected to take up to two years. The work will be split equally between London, the Rwandan capital Kigali and Nairobi in Kenya. This early trial is being run by the International Aids Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), a non-profit organisation. The principal investigator, Dr Jill Gilmour, who has worked at the laboratory at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital since its founding in 2001, says she is optimistic that the Aids virus can eventually be tackled with a vaccine. The virus is now 30 years old, and the search for a vaccine has proved elusive so far. However, an American-backed trial in Thailand found in 2009 that a combination of two vaccine prototypes was 30% effective in preventing HIV infection. Follow-up trials are being planned with the aim of improving those initial results. In the IAVI trial, volunteers who are free of HIV and not at risk of catching the infection will receive a combination of two vaccines. One of them is derived from a weakened version of Sendai, a flu-like virus that infects rodents. It will be administered through nasal drops. This is because in the early stages of infection, both HIV and Sendai affect the mucosal tissues, which are found in the nose and also in the genital area. Dr Gilmour said: \"I believe it's not if, it's when we will have an effective HIV vaccine. There is now strong scientific data to support that position. \"We will get there but vaccine development takes time. It's not for the faint-hearted. \"Bear in mind that with polio, it was 45 years from discovering the virus to getting an effective vaccine. \"HIV is a formidable beast with sneaky tricks. It changes every time it divides, so it's highly variable. And it can integrate into your own cells, so your immune system can't see it.\" The trial is early work known as Phase I, meaning that the aim is to ensure the vaccine is safe and induces an immune response. Dr Gilmour added: \"Delivering the vaccine into the nose has public health benefits, because we're not using needles. \"If we see strong immune responses, we go into the larger second phase of testing whether the vaccine is effective in reducing transmission or lowering the load of the virus. \"The Sendai product is modified from a virus which affects rodents, including hamsters. From our perspective, it's a bonus that this virus has lived in the human environment without causing us harm.\" The IAVI laboratory at Chelsea and Westminster handles almost 100,000 blood samples a year and has supported more than 20 other vaccine trials. Its work includes sending test kits to sub-Saharan African countries at the heart of the Aids epidemic, carefully tracking the thousands of blood samples that it holds and ships elsewhere, and ensuring the data and paperwork from trials is rigorously monitored, so the results from different sets of tests can be pooled. Jason Warriner, clinical director at the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: \"We welcome investment in the search for a vaccine against HIV. This research is in its very earliest stages. Clinical trials take several years to complete and, even if the vaccine passes this first stage of tests, more research will be needed over the course of many years. \"Although an HIV vaccine has so far remained stubbornly out of reach, we now understand how to prevent transmission better than ever before. \"A combination of widespread condom use, regular testing for HIV, and getting those with the virus onto the right treatment, could drastically reduce HIV within a generation.\"", "abstract": "A fresh effort to find a vaccine for HIV is beginning at laboratories in a London hospital and two centres in Africa.", "candidate": "The world's first clinical trial of an HIV vaccine has begun.", "doc_id": 2675, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "A clinical trial of an HIV vaccine is planned.", "evidence": "Scientists are recruiting 64 healthy adult volunteers for the trial, which is expected to take up to two years.", "explanation": "does not state it's the world's first, doesn't say it is started, but that they're doing recruitment", "instruction": "Remove the information about world's first from the summary.

In this case, each fringe is a step of 2.8cm. \u201cThe InSAR data show that the earthquake has warped the Earth's surface by a maximum of 23cm, causing subsidence in a 25km-long elongate region roughly between the towns of Norcia and Amatrice,\u201d explained Dr Richard Walters from Durham University, UK, who built the map. \u201cThe fault that ruptured was around 20km long. The average slip at depth on the fault was about half a metre, but is concentrated in two major patches, which probably means two separate fault segments ruptured together. \u201cMost slip took place at depth, with only a small amount reaching the surface.\u201d . Dr Walters is affiliated to Britain\u2019s NERC Centre for Observation and Modelling of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Tectonics (COMET). To make the map, he used radar data from the European Union\u2019s Sentinel-1a and 1b satellites. These spacecraft circle the globe, routinely imaging all land surfaces at least once every six days. Their rapid return to any one location means they were in a position to view central Italy as soon as Friday after the quake, and then again on Saturday. Dr Walters\u2019 point about most of the slip being at depth illustrates the usefulness of InSAR. Not all ruptures will show an obvious surface expression, such as a buckled road or a newly opened fissure in the ground. But the InSAR data, in revealing the scale of warping, still permits scientists to trace the fault involved even if some of its sections are somewhat hidden. This was true of 2009\u2019s damaging quake in L\u2019Aquila, to the south of Amatrice, which killed 309 people. Surface breaks were small and geologists initially had some difficulty in identifying the fault responsible for the magnitude-6.3 event.

In the past, people have hidden themselves in stores in the US, Canada, UK, Belgium, Netherlands, Japan, Australia and Poland. Most recently, two 14-year-old girls were caught after spending the night at the branch in Jonkoping in Sweden. The craze appears to have been started by two Belgian YouTubers in August. Their video, which has had 1.7 million views, documents their exploits - including jumping on beds - after they hid in a wardrobe for three hours to avoid detection. Unlike the 14-year-old girls, however, they were not caught and walked out after spending another few hours in the wardrobes waiting for the store to open. Ikea has decided not to formally charge the Jonkoping teenagers because of their young age, but two girls who were caught in Malmo, Sweden, in October were not so lucky. According to Sydsvenskan, the 15-year-olds had been too scared of setting off the alarm to leave the cupboards they were hiding in, and were reported to police for trespassing when they were discovered in the morning.

{"article": "Rising energy prices pushed inflation to 1.8% in January, a near four-year high and up from 1.1% in December. Eurostat data also showed the jobless rate fell to 9.6% in December, the lowest rate since May 2009. GDP growth edged up to 0.5% in the final three months of 2016, up from 0.4% in the previous quarter. The rise in eurozone inflation last month was driven by an 8.1% jump in energy prices in January compared with the year before. The spike in the rate takes it up to the European Central Bank's inflation target of close to, but below, 2%. Some have called for the European Central Bank to further scale back its bond-buying programme. However, the ECB also looks at core inflation, which excludes energy and unprocessed food prices, in its policy decisions, and this rate remained unchanged at 0.9% in January. In December, the ECB said it would buy bonds worth 60bn euros a month from April. The 80bn euro-a-month quantitative easing scheme had been due to end in March, but was expected to be extended. The stimulus programme was an effort to increase the supply of money in the economic bloc to keep interest rates low, and encourage borrowing and spending. The European Central Bank's key job is to maintain \"price stability\" in the Eurozone, which it interprets as inflation of below but close to 2%. For the last few years it has been wrestling with inflation that its governing council considers too low, at times even below zero - a situation of deflation or falling prices. That has led the bank to choose very unusual policies intended to stimulate prices rises - ultra-low interest rates (one of its rates is negative) and quantitative easing, buying financial assets with newly created money. So with inflation now at 1.8%, pretty much in line with the target, is that job done? Time to turn the policy taps off? Not necessarily. The rise in inflation is down to higher food and especially energy prices. The impact of those factors is likely to fade and other price rises are still relatively slow. There are different views in the ECB's governing council but the majority are not likely to be in a hurry to get policy back to normal. The eurozone's unemployment rate of 9.6% in December was down from 9.7% in November and compares with a rate of 10.5% a year earlier. The countries with the lowest unemployment rates in December were the Czech Republic (3.5%) and Germany (3.9%), while countries with the highest levels of unemployment were Greece (23.0% in October 2016) and Spain (18.4%). Despite the pick-up in economic growth during the final quarter of 2016, across the year as a whole eurozone GDP rose by 1.7%, which was down from 2% in 2015. Analysts also questioned whether the recent improvement could be sustained. \"While recent economic news points to improved growth, we suspect the eurozone may find it difficult to sustain this momentum amid appreciable political uncertainties during 2017 and likely reduced consumer purchasing power due to higher inflation,\" said Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight. \"Consequently, we suspect that eurozone GDP growth in 2017 will be no more than 1.6%.

Each year primary schools will continue to receive \u00a38,000, plus \u00a35 per pupil. As well as promoting good health, Mr Cameron says, school sport has an important role in building \"confidence and a sense of achievement\". The funding - the Primary PE and Sport Premium - provides money directly to primary school head teachers, carrying on the sporting legacy of the Olympics. There have also been repeated warnings about childhood obesity and lack of exercise. The funding is meant to improve sports lessons, such as paying for specialist coaching, equipment or to help after-school clubs. It was announced last year as a two-year initiative to run until 2015-16, but Mr Cameron has said he wants to keep this funding for another five years - beyond the general election. \"Sport is so important because it encourages children to be active, lead a healthy lifestyle, make friends and, of course, have fun,\" Mr Cameron said. \"But quality school sport has benefits that spread right across the curriculum and beyond - it develops confidence and a sense of achievement, it teaches young people how to rise to a challenge, and nurtures the character and skills that will help them get on and succeed in life.\" Sports presenter Clare Balding said that sport could also help academic results in school. \"As well as increasing fitness, it has been shown to help concentration as well as being a key factor in appreciating team work and a healthy lifestyle,\" she said. Olympic champion Mo Farah said sports could make an important difference to young lives. \"The help I got at school was a key part of how I got to where I am today and so it can make a big difference,\" he said.

{"article": "Arlene Foster's comments followed a week of disagreements over expenses payments. In a speech on Friday, the DUP leader called for \"a completely independent system\" for administering expenses. She said the electorate \"need to be confident that we're one of them, fighting for them and not for ourselves\". Mrs Foster added: \"If people are going to vote for us, they need to have confidence in us.\" On Friday, the Assembly Commission and the Stormont expenses watchdog issued a joint statement on expenses payments. It said the two bodies are committed to working together to sort out the differences. In her speech to DUP members in Cookstown, County Tyrone, Mrs Foster expressed frustration that the issue was preventing her from communicating her vision for Northern Ireland. She said that she left the stability of a career in the legal profession \"because [she] believed in a cause\". \"I wanted to make Northern Ireland a better place. I still have that vision,\" she said. \"At the minute, no-one can hear about my vision for Northern Ireland because the administration of expenses is the main issue. \"As leader of this party, I am not going to let an issue like this destabilise our strategy. \"How we deal with this will reflect on how we deal with other matters of government.\" The first minister said that she plans to send a letter to DUP assembly candidates and other party leaders appealing for a new system to deal with financial matters in the new term. \"The DUP has consistently argued that politicians should have absolutely no role in either deciding the level of their pay or expenses, or in administering the system by which those expenses are paid. \"The completely independent system at Westminster may not be perfect, but it has instilled public confidence that failures of the past will not be repeated.\" At present, an independent Stormont regulator determines the level of MLAs' pay and Office Cost Allowances. However, claims are submitted to, and processed by staff within the assembly. Mrs Foster suggested that this \"creates confusion and dents public confidence\". \"We need a completely independent system, just as there is in Westminster, where expenses are taken entirely out of the hands of MLAs and of staff working for the Northern Ireland Assembly,\" she said. \"The DUP proposed exactly this kind of system 18 months ago.

In his letter, Riddell, supported by authors such as Michael Morpurgo, Jacqueline Wilson and Quentin Blake, said: \" I have seen personally, in my school visits up and down the country, how they promote reading for pleasure and in doing so, turn pupils into avid readers. \"I am deeply concerned that this role is not fully appreciated and, worse, is being undermined through lack of economic and intellectual investment. \"In recent months two major school library services closed in Dorset and Berkshire, and year after year the School Library Association loses members as school library provision shrinks through lack of funding.\" He said he had seen how library provision was \"wildly inconsistent\", with great examples of well-funded and staffed libraries. He said the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Libraries had asked the DfE to gather statistics on school library provision so that the extent of this problem could be understood, but this had not yet happened. Riddell also said: \"While schools face insidious pressure on budgets and staff, things cannot change. \"That is why, with the backing of my fellow laureates, I am now calling on Justine Greening and the Department of Education to act on the all-party group's request and then set out clear standards of library provision, and put into place the necessary funding.\" This way, every school would have a library service it could be proud of, with books to borrow and, wherever possible, a school librarian to help children choose, he said.

Bothina Mohmed Ahmed, a spokeswoman for the state of South Darfur, said it was not known how the six deaths had happened, and that an investigation had been launched. Opposition activists and media accused the police of using live ammunition. The protests started on Monday when local students \"rejected the price of transport announced by the government\", Ms Ahmed said, adding that \"other groups\" had joined the protests and attacked government buildings. \"This has been happening on the main roads and in the main market area. There's been some damage to buildings,\" African Union-UN peacekeeping mission spokesman Christopher Cycmanick told AFP.

They had recently dwindled as a result of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which began on 20 July.

But as she walked into her sparse, simple kitchen there was a pile of rubble on the floor, below a large hole in the ceiling. And on top of the rubble, lay the barely-recognisable body of a woman. The woman, whose name Inna never found out, was one of the 298 people killed when the Malaysian Airlines passenger jet MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine a year ago. \"When I think about it, it is like it's real, as though it's happening now\", said Inna. \"The picture is vivid.\" Fighting back the tears, she speaks of how she imagines the \"unbearable pain\" of the woman's family, and her own grief for a stranger, murdered in the sky over her home. In total 39 bodies lay scattered around Inna's village of Rossypnoye, and some were not collected for several days. The local mayor, Oleg Miroshnichenko, says people in the area experienced a deep sense of shock and tragedy that \"resonated with every human soul\". And he says the feelings have not gone away. \"It's an irreversible pain.\" Inna, who wears a silver crucifix around her neck, believes some form of justice awaits those responsible for downing the plane. \"No matter what, the people who did it will be punished,\" she says. Establishing who shot down flight MH17, how they did it, and from where, is the job of a Dutch-led international investigation team, which hopes to publish some of its findings in the new year. As well as forensic work on the wreckage of the aircraft, the Dutch prosecutor leading that investigation, Fred Westerbeke, told the BBC that investigators had been studying \"billions\" of internet pages, and tens of thousands of photos and videos related to the downing of the airliner. He confirmed that his team had spoken to about 140 witnesses, and identified a number of \"persons of interest\", but he said it was too early to identify them as suspects, or release their names or nationalities. What we know . MH17 crash: The 298 who perished . Dutch reporter: My revealing fragments . Special report . Getting to the truth behind the downing of the airliner is a Herculean task, given the climate of mistruths and propaganda in eastern Ukraine, linked to the conflict in the region. To counter accusations of bias, Mr Westerbeke said his team had to properly consider all theories and all claims. \"An alternative scenario, whoever brings it out, you have to prove that that could not have been the case\", he said. \"We have to clear out all of the other options.\" A separate investigation, being carried out by the Dutch Safety Board, is expected to publish its full findings in October. Its preliminary report, published last year, found that the plane broke up in mid-air after being hit by \"objects\" that \"pierced the plane at high-velocity\". That analysis is consistent with possible shrapnel damage sustained from a surface-to-air-missile. But for now, relatives of those who were killed are left waiting for answers. Jeremy Pocock's 20-year-old son, Ben, was travelling on the plane. He says it is \"absolutely crucial\" that those responsible are identified and brought in front of an international tribunal - an idea backed by several countries, including the Netherlands, Malaysia, Australia, and now also Britain. Speaking to the BBC ahead of the first anniversary of the disaster, Mr Pocock called on the UK government to take a more robust position in the pursuit of justice for the 10 British victims on board the plane. He also questioned why Russia had expressed scepticism about the idea of an international tribunal. \"We mustn't lose sight of the fact that there were 80 children on that plane, including many babies,\" he said. \"Families were wiped out.

{"article": "In 1903, scientists decided Brontosaurus was a more complete specimen of a different dinosaur. But many more specimens of plant-eating sauropod dinosaurs are now known, revealing Brontosaurus to be different enough to warrant its own name. The results have been published in the open access journal PeerJ. The name Brontosaurus goes back to the so-called Bone Wars of the late 1800s, when rival fossil hunters Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope raced new dinosaur names into the scientific literature. In their quest for new specimens, Marsh and Cope were drawn to the rich fossil beds of the American west. Marsh's team found two long-necked sauropods. He named one Apatosaurus ajax (Apatosaurus means \"deceptive lizard\") and the second skeleton Brontosaurus excelsus (Brontosaurus means \"noble thunder lizard\"). Shortly after Marsh's death, a team from the Field Museum of Chicago found another dinosaur skeleton similar to both Apatosaurus ajax and Brontosaurus excelsus, but with features deemed intermediate between the two. This led the scientists to conclude that Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus were just different species within the same scientific genus. Apatosaurus took precedence because it had been named first so, Brontosaurus excelsus became Apatosaurus excelsus. But the name Brontosaurus is still known by several generations of schoolchildren. It's not entirely clear why the name stuck, but it may be to do with its origins in the Bone Wars, when there was intense public interest in the discovery of new dinosaurs. It may also be because of the evocative meaning: \"thunder lizard\". Now, Emanuel Tschopp from the New University of Lisbon in Portugal and colleagues applied statistical techniques to calculate the differences between species and genera of diplodocid dinosaurs (the large-scale grouping that includes Apatosaurus as well as other long-necked plant eaters). It is only with new finds of dinosaurs similar to Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus in recent years that it became possible to undertake a detailed investigation of how different they were. \"Until very recently, the claim that Brontosaurus was the same as Apatosaurus was completely reasonable, based on the knowledge we had,\" said Mr Tschopp. To their suprise, Brontosaurus emerged from the analysis as a distinct dinosaur. \"The differences we found between Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus were at least as numerous as the ones between other closely related genera, and much more than what you normally find between species,\" explained Roger Benson, a co-author from the University of Oxford. Thus, the researchers argue that it is now possible to resurrect Brontosaurus as a genus, different from Apatosaurus. Prof Paul Barrett, of London's Natural History Museum, who was not involved in the research, told BBC News: \"This paper is the most comprehensive study produced to date on the evolution of Diplodocus and its closest relatives and sets out some really interesting new ideas on how these animals are related, and how they should be classified. \"The author finds a number of ways in which the original specimens of Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus can be separated from each other and uses these to resurrect Brontosaurus as a separate entity. \"The conclusions seem entirely reasonable to me, as they are well argued and well supported, and it will be interesting to see how how quickly these suggestions are adopted by the community.\" Marsh's case was not helped by making an incorrect reconstruction of Brontosaurus' skull because of the limited material available at the time. He had assumed it was boxy, like another long-necked dinosaur from the western US known as Camarasaurus. But research in the 1970s showed that Apatosaurus - and thus \"Brontosaurus\" - would have had a slender, horse-like skull. This gave rise to a popular myth that \"Brontosaurus\" was simply an Apatosaurus with the wrong head.

{"article": "Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi announced that Tiran and Sanafir would be transferred in April, during a visit by Saudi Arabia's King Salman. More than 150 people were jailed in connection with protests over the deal, though many were later acquitted or had their sentences reduced on appeal. The Egyptian government has said it will challenge Tuesday's ruling. Tiran and Sanafir are uninhabited and located at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba, a strategic part of the Red Sea bordered by Israel, Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Egyptian troops have been stationed there since 1950 at Riyadh's request. Mr Sisi's decision in April to cede control of them to Saudi Arabia sparked widespread criticism. The president was accused of violating the constitution and \"selling\" the islands in return for a multi-billion dollar aid package unveiled by King Salman during his visit. But Mr Sisi insisted that Tiran and Sanafir had always belonged to Saudi Arabia. On Tuesday, Egypt's State Council, an administrative court, issued a verdict annulling April's maritime borders agreement between Cairo and Riyadh. The maritime border agreement signed earlier this year between Egypt and Saudi Arabia took many Egyptians by surprise. Since then, protesters have taken to the streets calling the arrangement unconstitutional, and accusing the government of giving away Egyptian territories in return for aid packages and investments worth billions of dollars from Saudi Arabia, a strong backer of President Sisi. Some of these protesters were arrested and charged with disrupting public order. A few are still behind bars. The lawsuit was filed by a number of prominent human rights lawyers, headed by a former presidential candidate, Khaled Ali. When the verdict was issued, many cheered inside the courtroom, chanting \"the islands are Egyptian\". But the legal battle has not come to an end yet, because the decision can be appealed. The verdict stated that the two islands would \"remain under Egyptian sovereignty\". If it is approved by the country's High Administrative Court it will become legally binding. However, the State Lawsuits Authority, which represents the Egyptian state in lawsuits, said on Tuesday evening that it would challenge the ruling, state television reported. Mr Sisi has cracked down on all dissent since leading the military's overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi in 2013.

The White House has cited the relatively high unemployment rate for black and Hispanic men over the age of 20 and a higher-than-national-average poverty rate for minority households. \"We've become numb to these statistics, we're not surprised by them, we take them as the norm,\" Mr Obama said. \"We just assume this is an inevitable part of American life, instead of the outrage that it is. \"But these statistics should break our hearts. And they should compel us to act.\" He spoke of visiting a school near his home in Chicago and sharing with the boys there his own experience of growing up without a father, acknowledging to them that he had been angry about that and had made \"bad choices\" and \"got high without always thinking about the harm that it could do\". \"I could see myself in these young men,\" Mr Obama told the audience at the White House. \"And the only difference is that I grew up in an environment that was a little bit more forgiving, so when I made a mistake the consequences were not as severe.\" Mr Obama's new initiative calls for foundations and community groups to co-ordinate investment in support programmes to keep young Hispanic and black men in school and away from crime. A public online portal called What Works will provide access to data about such programmes. To start the programme, a new federal task force will look at several issues affecting young men. These include access to childhood support, grade school literacy, pathways to university and careers, as well as interactions with the criminal justice system and violent crime. President Obama earlier met with foundation and business leaders and senior government officials to discuss the initiative and to thank them for their support. According to the White House, business leaders have already invested $150m and plan to invest another $200m in the project over the next five years. Senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett described the effort earlier on Thursday as the beginning of a life-long endeavour for Mr Obama and his wife Michelle. Ms Jarrett told US media it was a \"moral, social responsibility that they feel will transcend the time that he's president\".", "abstract": "US President Barack Obama has called for a national campaign to improve opportunities for black and Hispanic boys and young men.", "candidate": "US President Barack Obama has launched a task force to help young black and Hispanic men.", "doc_id": 1631, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "In a memorandum released on Thursday, the White House said the task force would focus on issues facing boys and young minority men under the age of 25.", "explanation": "Specifically states that Obama launched the \"task force\" and that it helps young minority men, which includes black and Hispanic men.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

Campaigners against the \u00c2\u00a315m proposal to build an embankment claimed it would have a detrimental effect on the town's main beauty spots.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said a cot blanket made from Tasmanian merino wool was being sent on behalf of the Australian people to mark the royal birth. It was made at the country's oldest weaving mill, Waverly Woollen Mills, Tasmania, and has been embroidered with the Australian floral emblem, the wattle. Mr Abbott said his government would also be making a A$10,000 (\u00c2\u00a35,200) donation to the Healesville Sanctuary, in Victoria, in honour of the princess. \"I hope one day the princess can visit Australia and hold a Mountain Pygmy-possum herself,\" he said.

Major-General Alexei Ragozin, the deputy commander of Russia's paratroop forces, told the RIA news agency that negotiations had been \"very difficult\". \"The talks were not easy, but common sense prevailed and everything turned out well\" he said. However, he criticised the length of the soldiers' detention. \"I find it unacceptable that the Ukrainian side kept our soldiers for so many days\" he said. \"Our lads are upset about everything that happened. They will all receive the necessary psychological and other kinds of help\" he added. Ukraine released video interviews with the captured Russian soldiers last week.

{"article": "The Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone was elected in 2015 with DUP support. MPs backed a request from the prime minister to hold a snap general election on 8 June by 522 votes to 13. Sinn F\u00e9in's northern leader said Mrs May had shown a \"blatant disregard for the people of the north\". Michelle O'Neill said the prime minister's announcement of a general election was about \"the Tory party's self interest\". Meanwhile, the SDLP rejected any suggestion of her party entering a pact with Sinn F\u00e9in. DUP MP Ian Paisley said the \"deep frost button\" had been pressed on power-sharing talks in Northern Ireland. Mr Paisley expressed concerns about the future of the talks process during the general election campaign. \"We are seeing the freezer bags come out and the deep frost button being pressed on the Assembly,\" he said. In the last general election, in May 2015, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) agreed pacts in four constituencies, including the UK's most tightly-contested seat of Fermanagh and South Tyrone. That pact helped Mr Elliott take the seat from Sinn F\u00e9in's Michelle Gildernew - she had held on to it by just four votes in 2010. On Tuesday, UUP leader Robin Swann said he was \"open\" to discussion on the issue of pacts. Mr Elliott told the BBC on Wednesday it was important that the \"people of Northern Ireland have representation at Westminster\". He also said talks with the DUP would take place in the days ahead to secure the \"best agreement around some constituencies\". Earlier, DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his party wanted to \"quickly\" arrange talks with the UUP on a potential pact. Sir Jeffrey told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that the DUP was \"prepared to go further\" this time. \"We recognise that - if Northern Ireland is to maximise its representation and to have a strong voice in the absence of our own government - then we need to return MPs who will actually take their seats at Westminster,\" he said. Sinn F\u00e9in currently has four MPs but they do not take their seats in the House of Commons, in protest at British rule in Northern Ireland. Sir Jeffrey suggested there should be a new unionist pact in Fermanagh and South Tyrone and \"other constituencies as well\". The DUP MP highlighted South Belfast as one constituency where the unionists could gain a seat from nationalists by agreeing to stand a single-unity candidate. The seat is currently held by SDLP MP Dr Alasdair McDonnell. However, there will be no reciprocal deal between nationalist parties, according to Dr McDonnell's colleague, South Down MP Margaret Ritchie. Mrs Ritchie told Good Morning Ulster: \"We don't do electoral pacts\". \"The SDLP fights the election - each and every election - on our own mandate and our own basis,\" she said. Speaking on the same programme, Sinn F\u00e9in's national chairperson, Declan Kearney, said his party shared much \"common ground\" with the SDLP, Alliance and the Green Party on issues such as Brexit, equality and the legacy of the Troubles. He said parties opposed to a hard Brexit and austerity policies should work together. \"We'll do our best to maximise the Sinn F\u00e9in vote,\" Mr Kearney said. UUP MP Danny Kinahan criticised Sinn F\u00e9in abstentionism. \"At the moment, there are four seats where no-one turns up at Westminster and it is the mother of all parliaments,\" he said. The UUP MP admitted that he was \"likely to have a battle with the DUP\" to hold on to his South Antrim seat.

{"article": "Set 238 to win, Pakistan reached their target with 23 balls to spare thanks to Sarfraz Ahmed's unbeaten 101 in Adelaide. Ireland captain William Porterfield earlier made 107, but his wicket triggered a slide to 237 all out. The Irish finish fifth in Pool B, behind West Indies on net run-rate, while Pakistan go on to meet Australia in Adelaide in the last eight on Friday. Before the tournament, Cricket Ireland chief executive Warren Deutrom said it would be a \"failure\" if Porterfield's side did not reach the quarter-finals. But for the third World Cup in succession, the Irish have acquitted themselves well, winning three games and beating two Test-playing sides in West Indies and Zimbabwe. England won only two matches, neither against Test nations. Indeed, Ireland could have reasonably expected to go through with six points, only for their elimination to come as a result of several factors. Heavy losses to South Africa and India damaged their net run rate, West Indies earned three big wins to boost theirs, while Pakistan recovered from two opening defeats to claim four successive victories. This latest win continues the improvement of Misbah-ul-Haq's men, echoing the Pakistan side that began poorly when the tournament was last held in Australia and New Zealand in 1992, only to go and lift the trophy. For Ireland, their creditable showing will be used as evidence by those who say the next World Cup should not be cut from its current 14-team format to only 10 sides. The Irish still have the chance to qualify for that tournament as well as the opportunity to earn Test status through the 2017 Intercontinental Cup. Victory over Pakistan at the Adelaide Oval would have seen them progress past the first round of the World Cup for the second time, but they were unable to take enough runs from a disciplined attack, then lacked the penetration and accuracy to make the chase uncomfortable. Plenty of the Ireland top order got starts, but there was not enough support for Porterfield, who pulled, clipped and drove his way to the highest score made by an associate captain in a World Cup match. However, the collective accuracy of the Pakistan pace attack was impressive and, when left-hander Porterfield miscued Sohail Khan to mid-on, the lower order was exposed. Despite the sluggish nature of the wicket, the Irish regularly found trouble playing the short ball, with the last six wickets falling for 55 runs. Ireland's collection of medium-pacers and spinners may have been able to use the conditions to their advantage, but regular width aided the Pakistan cause. Sarfraz, dropped by wicketkeeper Gary Wilson standing up to Kevin O'Brien on 37, shared an opening stand of 120 with Ahmed Shahzad, whose cut shots benefitted from Irish inaccuracy. When he skied Stuart Thompson to mid-on and Haris Sohail was run-out in a mix-up with Sarfraz, Irish hopes were revived. But Misbah arrived to steady in a stand of 82, taking two sixes over the leg side before treading on his stumps off Alex Cusack with 30 still required. That left the patient Sarfraz to complete his maiden one-day international hundred, with Umar Akmal belting Paul Stirling down the ground to bring Ireland's spirited campaign to a close.

{"article": "Government figures show 375 doses, sent to addresses in England, Wales, and Scotland, were seized in 2016, compared with just five in 2013. Taking the pills while pregnant without medical approval is illegal in the UK. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service said as awareness of the online pills increased, more women were using them. The figures, from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) - which regulates medicines in the UK - show there were 375 pills seized last year, up from 270 in 2015 and 180 in 2014. The seizures were made during the MHRA's annual week-long raids, known as Operation Pangea, at places like postal hubs where foreign post is kept before being distributed to local post offices. NHS abortion treatment is free and widely available in Britain, but remains mostly illegal in Northern Ireland. However, the UK currently has the harshest punishment for self-induced abortion of any country in Europe, bar the Republic of Ireland. Under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861, anyone taking the pills could, in theory, be punished with a life sentence - no matter what the gestational period. Two women have been jailed for using the abortion pill bought online in the UK. In 2012, 40-year-old Sarah Catt was jailed for eight years for terminating her pregnancy with pills she had bought online when she was 39 weeks pregnant. Natalie Towers, 26, was sentenced to two-and-a half-years in 2015 after using the pill to terminate her pregnancy while she was between 32 and 34 weeks pregnant. Bpas and other women's groups are supporting a bill, proposed by Labour MP Diana Johnson, to be debated in the House of Commons next month, which seeks to decriminalise abortion. Some women have revealed why they were driven to using abortion pills purchased online. \"I was hoping to have a termination in the comfort of my own home without judgmental eyes and without worrying about my husband knowing. I fear what would happen if he did,\" one woman said. \"I have three children and my third is 11 months old. I considered an abortion when he was conceived and had a terrible pregnancy and [I am] still suffering from post natal depression.\" Another, a foreign student living in the UK, said she felt \"desperate\". \"I cannot afford this country's prices of procedure, and the place in line for supported abortions is just too long and not guaranteed. \"I feel absolutely horrible and desperate.\" Clara Watson, education officer for the charity Life, said the promotion of buying abortion pills online was dangerous. \"Some women aren't suitable for the abortion pill and may suffer from blood clots, there may be other underlying health issues, they may not know how far along they are. It's too risky,\" she said. Ann Furedi, Bpas chief executive, said women who bought the pills were often \"desperate\" and in \"difficult circumstances\". \"At Bpas, we do all that we can to make abortion services as accessible as possible. However, it is clear that for some women the barriers to clinic-based treatment feel insurmountable,\" she said. \"They are not criminals deserving of life imprisonment. Evidence suggests that as awareness of online abortion pills is increasing, so too are the numbers of women using these methods.\" She said women should not face criminal punishment. \"Fifty years after the 1967 Act was passed, it is time to bring women's reproductive healthcare into the 21st Century and remove abortion from the criminal law,\" she added. \"By doing so we would remove the clinically unnecessary legal barriers to treatment.\" She also urged women in need of advice or help to contact Bpas. Source: NHS choices . On 13 March, Labour MP Ms Johnson is proposing a Ten Minute Rule Bill that would repeal the relevant sections of the Offences Against the Person Act and decriminalise abortion.

{"article": "The line-up includes Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Mars and Jupiter and is best viewed from southern parts of the northern hemisphere. In Northern Ireland, astronomers say all five planets should come into view simultaneously by about 24 January. The Irish Astronomical Association said it will be a \"sight not to be missed\". However, successful planet spotting will depend on local weather conditions and the amount of cloud in the sky. Terry Moseley, a former president of the Irish Astronomical Association, said Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Mars and Jupiter are the only five planets that are ever visible from Earth with the naked eye, but it is rare to see all of them at once. He said that in the UK, the alignment would be visible in southern parts of England first and should come into view in Northern Ireland a few days later, as it lies further north. Mr Moseley added that four of the planets can be seen from Northern Ireland at the moment on clear nights, but added that \"elusive little Mercury\" is always the hardest to see because it is closest to the horizon. \"Mercury will be easiest to see from about 28 January to 2 February, but you should start looking from about 24 January in case the skies are cloudy later,\" Mr Moseley advised skywatchers. \"You should start looking from about 45 minutes before sunrise, and you'll need a good clear horizon to the south east,\" he added. \"Venus will be by far the brightest, a brilliant beacon above the south east horizon. Look about a hand-span to the left of Venus, and slightly below it, to try to spot Mercury, which will be much fainter, and not easy to find in the twilight glow.\" The director of Armagh Observatory, Mark Bailey, said the last time such a view was visible was January 2005. He will be talking to schoolchildren in Tandragee library, County Armagh, on Thursday, explaining what to look out for. Skywatchers will have to distinguish the row of planets from some very bright stars. Mr Bailey said that one of the brightest stars in the sky - Arcturus - will also form part of the alignment view, along with another star, Spica, more or less vertically below it. Observatory staff have produced images showing the alignment on the morning of Friday 22, January, shortly before Mercury is expected to come into view. Mr Moseley added: \"The group will be joined by the waning crescent moon from 1 February onwards, making an even more glorious sight.\" The pre-dawn sky show is best viewed from high ground, in places were there is little light pollution. \"You need a good, dark view towards the southern horizon,\" Mr Bailey said. He suggested locations such as Divis mountain in Belfast; the Sperrins in counties Londonderry and Tyrone and Slieve Beagh near the border with County Monaghan.

{"article": "The 20-year-old hit six fours, showing no ill-effects from the break to the same finger that caused him to leave England's winter tour of India early. Hameed was eventually bowled by seamer Jamie Porter as the visitors reached 319, thanks largely to a counter-attacking 74 from debutant Dale Vilas. Essex were 35-2 in reply at the close. After Lancashire opted to bat first, Hameed, playing after being hurt on the same finger practising against the Cambridge students this week, shared a third-wicket stand of 68 with Liam Livingstone. Steven Croft (48) then gave the visitors' innings impetus, but a flurry of wickets in the afternoon session put Essex in charge as Lancashire were reduced to 160-6. On his Essex debut, former Lancashire paceman Neil Wagner (3-100) and Aaron Beard (3-47) did the damage, along with the run-out of Shivnarine Chanderpaul on 15 by substitute fielder Callum Taylor. South African Kolpak signing Vilas struck 10 boundaries as his 101-ball innings to ensure there was no collapse from the visitors, but their total was still looking a little below par when he was the penultimate batsman out with the total on 268. However, England's James Anderson (13 not out) joined Kyle Jarvis (28) to put on 51 runs in fewer than 10 overs, which frustrated the hosts, taking Lancashire past 300, giving them a third batting point. Essex faced nine overs before stumps and began their reply solidly enough, but Jarvis and Anderson took a late wicket apiece to give their side a slight edge. Essex's former Lancashire paceman Neil Wagner told BBC Radio Essex: . \"It was tough graft out there. It was a pretty unresponsive wicket. It was quite good batting conditions with no cloud or moisture in the air and not much swing. And they played very well. \"It was a wicket where if you gave yourself time it will work for you and Dane Vilas showed that. Once you got in and set on the wicket you could score freely and for long periods of time. \"It was an outstanding delivery by Jamie Porter to remove Haseeb Hameed. He is a batsman who leaves the ball really well and makes good decisions. So it was a pretty good ball. \"Aaron Beard is an outstanding prospect for Essex. I am very excited watching him bowl. I love working with him, he's a good kid. He's still young and the talent and ability he's got at the moment is something to be very excited about.\" Lancashire's England opener Haseeb Hameed told BBC Radio Manchester: . \"The finger is fine now. It felt almost back to normal. It was a bit of a freak incident last week, injuring it in the warm-up and it was quite painful when I batted. \"We made the right decision in getting it checked out and thankfully it was all OK. It was the same finger I injured before. I was doing some short-leg practice and trapped it between ball and turf. \"It swelled up quite a lot and became painful. The surgeon has suggested that when there is a bit of time off it might be worth having surgery to take the plate in the finger out. \"I'm looking at the season in very small packages at the moment.

{"article": "Car Wheatley, 31, from Hatfield, Hertfordshire, was found guilty of murder at St Albans Crown Court on Wednesday. Alexa-Marie Quinn had 66 injuries including a bruise from her stomach to her ankles when she died last year. Wheatley was told he will have to serve a minimum of 21 years in jail before being considered for release. He had been awarded custody of Alexa-Marie in December 2013 - three months before he killed her. He admitted manslaughter, but the jury rejected his plea of not guilty to murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The jury was told Wheatley beat Alexa-Marie with \"hard, sustained, persistent hitting\" after losing his temper. The blows were delivered with such force that fat deposits entered her bloodstream, blocking her lungs, and it was described as the culmination of a period of beatings lasting several weeks. Police found her body on 12 March 2014 and a pathologist said she died from \"extreme blunt-force trauma\". The jury was told that psychiatrists diagnosed Wheatley with multiple mental health disorders. Prosecutor Christopher Donnellan QC said Wheatley dialled 999 on the morning of the fatal attack, but by the time paramedics arrived it was likely Alexa-Marie had been dead for hours.

{"article": "Mr Schleicher, who runs the tests, says the high results of deprived pupils in some Asian countries shows what poor pupils in the UK could achieve. The most disadvantaged pupils in Shanghai match the maths test results of wealthy pupils in the UK. Mr Schleicher says it \"debunks the myth that poverty is destiny\". On Monday, Education Secretary Michael Gove said individual schools in England should take Pisa tests, so that they could compare themselves against international standards. The latest Pisa - Programme for International Student Assessment - test results were published last year by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, ranking developed countries in terms of how well 15-year-olds performed in tests in reading, maths and science. Source: OECD . This showed the UK as a middle-ranking country, with Asian school systems, such as in Singapore, South Korea and Shanghai and Hong Kong in China, as the highest performers. But Mr Schleicher's latest analysis compares the performance of the most deprived 10% of pupils. This reveals how the poorest in many countries overlap with the results of the wealthy in other countries. The poorest 10% of pupils in Shanghai are as good as the most privileged 20% of teenagers taking the test in the UK and the United States. In Europe, the Netherlands has the highest-performing pupils from the poorest families. Poor pupils in the Netherlands are as good at maths as much better-off teenagers in France. The poorest 10% of pupils in Hong Kong scored at a higher level than the wealthiest in Sweden and Norway. The very lowest performers among this group were in the Slovak Republic. Mr Schleicher says it shows how academic differences attributed to social background should not be unquestioningly tolerated. \"We tend to overestimate the impact of poverty,\" he says . There was also a challenge to the idea that the UK has an unusually poor record on social mobility. Dr John Jerrim at the Institute of Education published a study suggesting that in international terms the UK was mid-ranking in the link between family background and future employment opportunities - 17th out of 34 developed countries. There was greater equity in Scandinavia and some European countries, including Germany and the Netherlands. But Dr Jerrim said social mobility in the UK was not dissimilar to France, Spain and Italy - and the UK's record was better than some central and eastern European countries. \"Policymakers often state that the relationship between family background and labour market earnings is stronger in the UK than most other countries,\" he said. \"It is not true that we stand out compared to the rest of world. Policymakers should avoid making such exaggerated claims when discussing this politically sensitive issue.\"", "abstract": "There is nothing inevitable about the weaker academic performance of poorer pupils, says an analysis of Pisa tests by the OECD's Andreas Schleicher.", "candidate": "Poor pupils in the UK are as good as better-off teenagers in other countries, according to Andreas Schleicher.", "doc_id": 2838, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "Better-off pupils in the UK are are equal to poor students in other countries, according to Schleicher.", "evidence": "The poorest 10% of pupils in Shanghai are as good as the most privileged 20% of teenagers taking the test in the UK and the United States.", "explanation": "It's an inverted errors, it's the other way around.

The higher rate is currently paid on annual taxable income of between \u00a343,001 and \u00a3150,000. Control over income tax is due to be split between UK and Welsh ministers, once an agreement can be reached. The report, by Prof James Foreman-Peck and Dr Peng Zhou, assumed no change in England's tax rates. Although they predicted tax income in Wales could fall in the first three years after a cut, the authors said receipts should rise in the longer term as high earners find it worthwhile to move from England. \"The encouragement to some households to immigrate, increasing Welsh taxable income, is greater than the revenue lost from the reduction in the rate\", the report said. For the top earners with income of more than \u00a3150,000 a year - about one in 100 UK residents - a cut in the additional 45% rate should also boost tax income in Wales, it added.

{"article": "It cost Charles Clarke his job as home secretary when back in 2006 it emerged that more than 1,000 foreign prisoners who should have been deported hadn't been. It's also been the subject of several select committee inquiries. And it continues to vex the Conservative MP for Kettering, Philip Hollobone. Throughout his time as an MP he has raised concerns about the number of foreigners in our prisons and our failure to send them back home to serve their sentences. Now a government minister not only praised him for his campaign, but admitted that he too shares Mr Hollobone's frustration. Mike Penning, minister for policing and criminal justice, told Parliament that while being briefed by officials he was \"very surprised... about some of the things that are being done\" and found it \"mind bogglingly difficult to work out why, in many cases, things do not happen.\" He was replying to a debate called by Mr Hollobone who had come up with some new figures about the extent of the problem. There are, he told MPs, 10,837 foreign national offenders in our prisons which make up 13% of the prison population. The highest number of offenders (938) come from Poland, followed by Ireland (779) and Jamaica (737). The cost of looking after them, he said was \"north of \u00a3300m\" a year. \"Such people need to serve their sentences in secure detention in prisons in their own country,\" he said. \"At a time of severe constraints on public expenditure, that is far too large a bill to ask British taxpayers to pay.\" Mr Hollobone is particularly angry that many of these countries do not have prisoner transfer agreements with the UK. A compulsory agreement with Jamaica is still awaiting ratification by the Jamaican government, there is \"only\" a voluntary agreement with Pakistan and India and no agreement with Somalia or Bangladesh or several EU countries including Poland. \"Poland, which is top of the list with almost 1,000 of its nationals in our prisons, has a specific derogation from accepting prisoner transfers under that EU agreement until the end of December 2016,\" said Mr Hollobone. \"That is an absolute outrage. Poland should be securing those people in secure detention back in Poland, at the expense of Polish taxpayers.\" He is also calling for the British government to use \"the huge and increasing international aid budget to build suitable prisons in countries that provide us with a large number of prisoners.\" He has discovered that in 2012 we gave \u00a3973m in aid to Jamaica, Pakistan, Nigeria, Somalia, India and Bangladesh who have a total of 2,900 of their citizens in British jails. \"It costs this country more than \u00a3100m a year to incarcerate these people in our jails. \"It would be a good idea to spend some of that \u00a3973m on building prisons in those six countries,\" he argued. Mr Penning admitted that he had been briefed by his officials \"to ensure that I stuck to the line and read the speech, which I will not do\". He went on to admit that he agreed with nearly everything Mr Hollobone had said: \"The frustration that he can hear in my voice was in his voice. I share his frustration.\" The minister said he would like to see as many foreign nationals as possible serve their sentences in their country of origin and he added that it was important that \"our friends in Europe fulfil their commitments\". \"I agree that we have to work much harder because this matter has been ignored for too many years,\" he said.

{"article": "UK owners can get affected diesel vehicles repaired, but in the US they can also claim up to $10,000 (\u00a37,400). The Transport Select Committee also said the government had been too slow to investigate whether VW should be prosecuted in the UK for the scandal. The government insisted it was pushing the firm \"to ensure they take action\". Louise Ellman, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said VW had \"acted cynically\" to cheat emissions tests. \"Volkswagen's evidence to us was just not credible but the government has lacked the will to hold VW accountable for its actions,\" she said. Analysis: Richard Westcott, BBC transport correspondent . Along with all the detail about VW, this report also highlights an issue raised recently by the BBC. It talks about the \"recent revelations\" that carmakers misled regulators or exploited loopholes in the regulations on a \"substantial scale\". Basically, the rules allow manufacturers to downgrade or switch off emissions cleaning systems at certain times to protect the engine. Testing figures suggest some are doing it when the outside temperature falls below about 17C, which is most of the year in Britain. They justify it by saying cold weather can damage components, but the suspicion is it gives them more miles to the gallon. It means the car is potentially more polluting than it needs to be, and we're talking millions of vehicles here. \"There is a real danger that VW will be able to get away with cheating emissions tests in Europe if regulators do not act.\" The German giant will offer to repair or buy back the affected diesel vehicles in the US and pay owners between $5,000 and $10,000 in compensation. But in the UK, owners affected have only been offered the option of a repair. The select committee called on regulators to ensure owners were not left out of pocket by VW's technical solution, which it said was developed as cheaply as possible. Ms Ellman said: \"Vehicle owners have been refused goodwill payments. That is despite VW inflicting a great deal of uncertainty on its own customers, along with the prospect of declining residual values and the inconvenience of having to undergo repairs.\" A Department for Transport (DfT) spokesman said it had taken VW's \"unacceptable actions extremely seriously\", adding: \"We continue to push VW to ensure they take action.\" Volkswagen said it had contacted all 200,000 UK owners affected by the issue and advised them to take their cars to their closest dealer. \"Close to 50,000 vehicles in the UK have now received the technical measure, a number which will continue to increase as further vehicles' technical measures are developed, rigorously tested and then approved by the relevant transport authorities,\" a VW spokesman said. The MPs also said that the DfT failed to seek stricter emissions limits in new tests that will include real-world driving. \"We are concerned that manufacturers have far too great a say over how type approval reforms are implemented,\" Ms Ellman added. The DfT spokesman said the Real Driving Emissions test being introduced next year was \"robust and will make a real difference\". VW admitted last September that 482,000 of its diesel vehicles in the US were fitted with defeat device software to switch engines to a cleaner mode while they were being tested. It said that almost 1.2 million vehicles in the UK were affected, but disputed whether the software constituted a defeat device in the European Union.

A court heard that he had sex with the 13-year-old in the grounds of Dundee and Angus College. The meeting was arranged on Snapchat. Dundee Sheriff Court heard how the pair had met through mutual friends in 2015 but there was no contact between them until June 2016 when he added her on the social networking app. Fiscal depute Eilidh Robertson said that when they met they chatted for some time and the accused was immediately affectionate towards the girl, kissing and cuddling her. \"He told her he had been 'choking to go with her' and they then walked towards the college,\" Ms Robertson said. \"He repeatedly asked her if she would have sex with him, and when in the grounds of the college he said 'have sex with me there' and pointed to a grassy area. \"They went there and had sex, after which he stood up and said he had to leave.\" The girl's mother picked her up before the 13-year-old told her what had happened the next day. She then told a counsellor who called in police. The teenager was given a community payback order last year for his previous sex offence conviction. Sheriff Alastair Carmichael told him that custody was the only option this time because he did not appear to have learned from his previous community sentence. The 17-year-old pleaded guilty on indictment to a charge under the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act. Defence solicitor Katrina Clark urged the court to impose a second community payback order instead of a jail term. She said: \"He's aware he faces more time in custody. \"The more effective way forward for him would be through the intensive project outlined for him in the social work reports. That wouldn't be an easy option. \"This could be dealt with by a non-custodial sentence due to his age, the period he has spent in custody on remand and his acceptance of his guilt at an early stage.\" Sheriff Alastair Carmichael imposed a one-year sentence of detention on the teenager, placed him on the sex offenders register for 10 years and imposed a sexual offences prevention order for six years during which time he will be monitored by specialist police officers.

{"article": "Carl Bildt suggested a \"Yes\" vote would lead to the \"Balkanisation of the British Isles\" and set off \"unforeseen chain reactions\". Mr Salmond said the use of the word \"Balkanisation\" was insulting to the democratic process in Scotland. But a spokesman for Mr Bildt said the politician stood by his comments. The people of Scotland go to the polls on 18 September when they will be asked the \"Yes/No\" question: \"Should Scotland be an independent country?\" Mr Salmond said the Swede's remarks, made in the Financial Times newspaper, were not only insulting to Scotland but to the Balkan countries that had joined the EU. Both Croatia and Slovenia have become EU member states since the bloody wars that tore Yugoslavia apart in the 1990s. Mr Bildt is a former prime minister of Sweden who also served as the UN's special envoy to the Balkans between 1999 and 2001. The FT quoted him saying that Scottish independence would have \"more profound implications than people think\". He added in the piece: \"The Balkanisation of the British Isles is something we are not looking forward to. It opens up a lot, primarily in Scotland but also in the UK. \"What are the implications for the Irish question?\" he asked. \"What happens in Ulster?\" In a BBC interview, the Mr Salmond took exception to these remarks. He said: \"I think the term Balkanisation was very foolish. \"Insulting to this democratic process in Scotland but also insulting to the new European member states from the Balkans who are now part of the democracy of the European Union.\" Slovenia has been in the EU for 10 years and Croatia became the newest member state last year. Montenegro, Serbia and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia are all candidates for EU membership. UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, was in Sweden for talks on the future of the EU with other centre-right leaders. At a news conference with Mr Cameron, Swedish Prime Minister, Fredric Reinfeldt, chose not to echo his foreign minister's remarks. He said: \"We also have a lot of experiences in referendums throughout Europe and we have learned to respect the results and not to speculate in advance.\" Sweden's shadow foreign minister, Urban Ahlin, said \"unfortunately we have a foreign minister with a specialty in insulting other nations. \"I think he's insulting the people of Scotland by comparing a democratic referendum with 'Balkanisation'.\" However, Mr Bildt is said to be standing by his remarks. The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Willie Rennie, said the comments reflected wider international concern. He explained: \"Balkanisation is not a term that I would use but it's quite clear that leaders across the world are expressing concern about the United Kingdom because the UK is a force for good across the globe.\" The SNP often draws inspiration from Scandinavian countries - including Sweden - for its vision of what an independent Scotland could achieve. Mr Bildt is not the only international figure to have commented on Scotland's future in recent days. Last Thursday, the US president Barack Obama said that America had a \"great interest\" in ensuring that the UK remained \"united\". He also stressed that the decision on independence was for Scottish voters. In his BBC interview, the first minister said the remarks were \"low level\" on the Richter scale of presidential interventions. But he appeared to suggest that they could still be counter productive. Mr Salmond said: \"I'm not sure if President Obama is familiar with the Scottish word 'thrawn'. \"It means more than stubborn. It means people don't appreciate being told what to do, I think.\" Mr Salmond said the president's comments had come as \"a surprise\" because the US had declared itself \"neutral\" in the referendum campaign. He also noted that the US had previously acknowledged the democratic nature of the Scottish debate.

{"article": "Mohammad Javad Zarif told Tasnim news agency that he sent a tweet saying: \"Happy Rosh Hashana\". In a Twitter exchange that followed, he also distanced himself from the Holocaust denials of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. It comes amid confusion over whether new President Hassan Rouhani also tweeted \"Happy Rosh Hashana\". A message came from a Twitter account thought to belong to Mr Rouhani earlier this week, but officials later said he did not have any such account. Iran has a Jewish community of up to about 30,000, according to some estimates, though much lower than the population which numbered about 80,000 prior to the 1979 Islamic revolution. The fact that Iranian leaders are congratulating Jews on the occasion of Rosh Hashana would not necessarily be controversial, say correspondents, but many in the international community are watching for signs that Mr Rouhani is seeking warmer ties with the West and Israel. Senior politicians are often the victims of Twitter hoaxes, whereby other web users set up fake accounts in their name. But in an interview given to Tasnim and published on Mr Zarif's Facebook page, the foreign minister confirmed he sent the \"Happy Rosh Hashana\" message because of Iran's Jewish community. By Rana RahimpourBBC Persian Service . The timing of these messages on Twitter may signal a shift in Iran's diplomatic discourse. A few weeks ahead of President Rouhani's trip to New York and Iran's first meeting with the IAEA since his election, it seems the new leadership is trying to present a more pragmatic and approachable side to the Islamic Republic. Furthermore, this rare instance of Iran's foreign minister using Twitter to respond to the daughter of a senior politician in the US, a country with which Tehran has had no diplomatic relations for three decades, means Iran is attempting to distance itself from the radical views of the last president. In summary, Iran's new administration appears keen to create a more benign atmosphere for negotiations. He then had a response from Christine Pelosi, the daughter of Nancy Pelosi, Minority Leader of the US House of Representatives, who said: \"Thanks. The new year would be even sweeter if you would end Iran's Holocaust denial, sir\". He replied: \"Iran never denied it. The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy New Year.\" He was referring to Mr Ahmadinejad who, during his presidency, frequently claimed the Holocaust was a lie. \"We have condemned the killing of Jews by Nazis as we condemn [the] killing and crackdown on Palestinians by Zionists,\" Mr Zarif told Tasnim. Mr Ahmadinejad's anti-Israel comments and Tehran's controversial nuclear programme helped contribute to Iran's increased isolation in recent years. Iran has been the target of four rounds of UN sanctions and numerous UN Security Council resolutions calling on it to cease enrichment work amid fears it aims to develop nuclear weapons. Iran has refused to obey, saying it intends to enrich only for power station fuel or other peaceful purposes. President Rouhani on Thursday announced that the foreign ministry would take over nuclear negotiations with the West from the Supreme National Security Council. The move makes it likely Mr Zarif - who has experience living in and negotiating with the West having served as Iran's envoy to the UN - will take over responsibility for the talks.

That has prompted reports Manchester United could rekindle their long-standing interest in the 28-year-old. \"It's a ridiculous, stupid story,\" agent Jonathan Barnett told BBC Sport. Bale was hampered by injury last season and lost his place to Isco, but previously flourished under Zidane and was rewarded with a place on the 30-man shortlist for the 2016 Ballon d'Or.

The charity said Rotherham should be \"a wake-up call for Scotland\". The Scottish government said it was committed to protecting children and young people's wellbeing. Revelations of child abuse on a massive scale in the English town were revealed in the Jay Report. Now Barnardo's Scotland has published 15 lessons it said must be learned by those involved in protecting children and young people in Scotland. The charity said child sex exploitation (CSE) \"is happening across Scotland\", with two large-scale police operations to identify victims and target perpetrators, one of which, Operation Dash, was ongoing. Barnardo's called for recognition, at every level, that sex between an adult and a child under 16 was always wrong and that it was not the child's responsibility to say 'No'. Martin Crewe, director of Barnardo's Scotland, said: \"We know child sexual exploitation is happening across Scotland. \"We know how devastating it can be. We know charities and support agencies are aware of the problem and are working to put the necessary infrastructure in place to tackle child sexual exploitation. \"But as part of this process, we all need to heed the warning and learn the lessons from Rotherham if we are to be certain that we are all doing our best to protect children from this horrific form of abuse in Scotland.\" He added: \"If there is one fundamental lesson from Rotherham it is that we cannot be complacent about child sexual exploitation in Scotland.\" Police Scotland said keeping children safe, particularly those who are vulnerable, was top of its list of priorities. As part of Operation Dash, 22 people have been reported to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service in relation to a range of crimes. Det Ch Supt Lesley Boal said: \"CSE is a complex challenging and sensitive area of policing. \"Police Scotland works nationally to support the Scottish government's action plan on CSE and we have developed an action plan to compliment this. \"In addition at a local level we have created 14 divisional public protection units that work in partnership with local authorities and health through child protection committees to tackle all forms of child abuse including CSE. \"Within Police Scotland we have a number of specialist units including the National Rape Task Force, the National Human Trafficking Unit and the National Domestic Abuse Task Force that focus on serious sexual crimes.\" The Scottish government published updated child protection guidance in May this year. A spokeswoman said: \"Child sexual exploitation is an abhorrent crime and can have devastating impact on victims and their families. \"We established an expert working group to specifically examine child sexual exploitation and this work contributed to our updated guidance. We also work closely with the experts at the Centre for Excellence for Looked After Children (CELCIS) to shape policies and practices to ensure that protection is as rigorous as possible. \"We share a duty- in families, communities, government, social care and the justice system - to protect young people from harm. \"Clearly all of us working to keep children safe in Scotland are considering the lessons to be learned from the Jay report to maintain a robust and responsive system of child protection in Scotland.

Benzema's failure to qualify comes after he was issued a domestic ban for his involvement in an alleged blackmail scandal over a sex tape. France's Prime Minister Manuel Valls said publicly before the selection that the Real Madrid striker \"has no place\" in the team. Ben Arfa, who plays for Nice and previously played for Newcastle and Hull, is among the reserves for the tournament so could still be called up to cover for injury. Noel Le Graet, the head of the French Football Federation, called Cantona's allegation \"ridiculous.\" Cantona and Deschamps, who are former France teammates, have fallen out numerous times since they played together in the mid-1990s.

{"article": "MSPs are studying Scotland's options going forward following the UK's vote to leave the EU. The committee has already reconvened once during the summer recess to take evidence from business leaders and economists. And convenor Joan McAlpine said they had only \"scratched the surface of identifying the true impact\" of Brexit. She appealed for businesses, organisations and individuals from across Scotland to engage with the committee by sending in written submissions or volunteering to give evidence. The committee is looking for views on the alternatives to EU membership and the implications of these on Scotland, how the withdrawal process might be managed at the EU and UK level, the positions likely to be taken by other EU member states and the contribution that EU citizens make to Scotland's economy and society. These views will inform the questions MSPs will put to Scottish and UK government ministers later in the year. Ms McAlpine said: \"Scotland is interconnected with the EU across a number of areas. From people, to investment, students, research and regional development funding to name a few. We need to understand both in the long and short term how Scotland will change as a result of this vote. \"More importantly when we hear from the Scottish and UK ministers later on this year, we will put to them some of the initial views we have heard in order to seek to influence the long and lengthy negotiations that will now follow.\" The committee took the unusual step of meeting during Holyrood's recess for a first round of evidence-gathering from a range of groups. They heard claims that Scotland's fishing industry could show \"world leadership\" having been \"unleashed\" by the Brexit vote.

{"article": "Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) said rock was dug away from cliffs near Bearreraig Bay in an apparent organised search for valuable specimens. The agency said Skye was known as Scotland's \"Dinosaur Isle\" because of its important fossil records. SNH has appealed for witnesses to contact the police. Skye is a key dinosaur fossil site in Scotland. Bearreraig Bay, north of Portree, is within a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). A crowbar is suspected to have been used to prise away some of the rock. Dinosaur footprints may also have been removed from Valtos on Skye, SNH said. Evidence gathered at Valtos has been used by palaeontologists to explain what has been called the Dino Stampede in Australia, an incident where a group of dinosaurs were pursued by a predator. SNH said the Bearreraig Bay dig had been done without the landowner's permission or the consent of SNH, which manages the SSSI. Dr Colin MacFadyen, SNH's geologist, also said the actions went against guidelines in the Scottish Fossil Code. The codes does allow for the use of mechanical diggers, rock saws and even explosives for extracting fossils, but only when it was to the benefit of palaeontological research. Dr MacFadyen said: \"Fossil collecting is important for scientific and educational purposes, and is a popular hobby. \"It is better for fossils that fall from cliffs to be found, collected and enjoyed rather than be eroded and washed away by the tide. \"However, speeding up the process by large scale rock removal as in this alarming case is irresponsible and illegal, and also potentially dangerous to people as the cliff faces are undermined and destabilised.\" Dr MacFadyen said permission to remove material from the SSSI would have been needed from SNH, but it had not been sought. He said fossil-rich rock had been damaged at the Bearreraig Bay site. Dr Neil Clark, of University of Glasgow's Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery, has described Skye as one of the world's most important palaeontology sites. Its standing is underlined by the number of finds from the Middle Jurassic, about 170 million years ago. Dr Clark told the BBC News Scotland website: \"This is quite a shock. It is not something I have heard of happening before. \"Without knowing exactly where the damage is I can't say what they were after. It may have been plesiosaur.\" He added: \"Whatever has been taken is now lost to science.\" Finds on Skye have included the earliest turtles known to have lived in water. The 164-million-year-old reptile fossils were found embedded in a block of rock at the bay of Cladach a'Ghlinne, on the Strathaird peninsula. The new species formed a missing link between ancient terrestrial turtles and their modern, aquatic descendants. The discovery of Eileanchelys waldmani, which translates as \"the turtle from the island\", was reported in the Royal Society journals in 2008.", "abstract": "Tonnes of rock has been disturbed at a Jurassic site on Skye in what has been described as one of Scotland's most reckless acts of fossil collecting.", "candidate": "Fossils believed to be about 170 million years old have been removed from cliffs on Skye.", "doc_id": 3370, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "\"Without knowing exactly where the damage is I can't say what they were after.

{"article": "US biologists used homing pigeons to test the potential impacts of oil spills on birds' flight. \"Lightly oiled\" pigeons, they found, veered off course and took longer to return and longer to recover than birds with no oil on their feathers. The results are published in the journal Environmental Pollution. It is the first time that the effects of low level exposure to crude oil on long-distance bird flight patterns have been tested and suggests that even small amounts of oil could have serious impacts on migrating birds that are caught up in a spill. The researchers were surprised by their findings, as lead author Dr Cristina Perez explained: \"The general notion would be that these birds are 'fine', but in fact we found that even lightly oiled birds are not uninjured.\" Dr Perez continued: \"We expected that the birds would have difficulties with flight and be slower in their arrival, but we did not expect such an obvious flight path difference.\" The study used crude oil collected from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill which was applied onto the wing and tail feathers of some of the homing pigeons with paintbrushes. This pattern of oiling reflected that seen in wild birds from the spill. The pigeons were trained to repeatedly undertake flights of 161km between release points and their home loft, all the while carrying GPS data loggers. After release, most of the oiled birds took different flight courses which were longer in duration and distance than those of un-oiled birds. These longer flights, more than double the length of the un-oiled birds, avoided crossing lakes and made use of the updrafts from mountains. They chose to minimise the risk of overwater crossings and may have been using their knowledge of the environment to make the journey easier. Such options would be unavailable for migrant water birds that had become oiled on their first migration. Young birds, with their pre-programmed flight plans would have no idea of the environmental barriers, such as long overwater flights, that they would meet on their onward migration. Historically, the focus has been on understanding the impact on heavily oiled seabirds, but study co-author and project leader Prof Chris Pritsos stressed the importance of such work to understand the impact on lightly-oiled birds, which he pointed out \"were observed oiled but still alive and functioning\" after the Deep Water Horizon spill. Prof Pritsos stressed that these sub-lethal effects could seriously impact subsequent breeding attempts by migrant birds caught up in the spill. The team found that oiled pigeons failed to regain the body mass lost between flights, unlike the un-oiled birds. This is a bad sign for migrant birds as it suggests that they may not be able to refuel sufficiently on their migratory stopovers in order to continue their journeys. Oiled pigeons also delayed their journeys for longer than the un-oiled group; they even experienced physical difficulties in getting airborne. Dr Perez indicated that a combination of GPS data loggers and free-flying homing pigeons could be \"considered for testing the effects of other environmental contaminants\" for the sort of detrimental impacts that \"wouldn't be discovered in birds in a wind tunnel environment alone\". Dr Kees Camphuysen, an expert on the impact of pollution on seabirds at the Royal Netherlands Institute of Sea Research, who was not involved on the study, remarked that it was \"interesting that slightly oiled birds with only one task (fly home) were hindered and that the effect lasted fairly long\". Dr Camphuysen went on to stress that water birds are likely to be more badly affected by oiling than land birds like pigeons, as they will be unable to adequately clean their feathers when wet and matted at sea. The Deepwater Horizon spillage of 134 million gallons of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico started on 20 April 2010. It was the biggest environmental disaster in US history and is estimated to have killed over one million birds.

{"article": "Sterling has fallen sharply against the euro since the Brexit vote in June. It means fresh fruit, vegetables, fish, meat and poultry are costing more for traders to buy. The UK economy has defied some of the gloomiest predictions since the EU referendum. But with many businesses working out what the weaker pound means for them, BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme spoke to traders in New Smithfield Market in Manchester for their views. Tony Howard is a salesman for Barton and Redman Ltd, a large independent fruit and vegetable wholesaler at the market. He says tomatoes from the Netherlands have gone up sharply. \"Before Brexit the average price of a box of tomatoes was around \u00a34 and now it is around \u00a36,\" he says. He sells on to caterers, hotel and restaurant owners and secondary wholesalers. \"We try to work for a gross profit of around 10%, so if I am paying \u00a36 for a tomato [box] I have to charge \u00a36.60 for it,\" he says. \"Secondary wholesalers and catering people have to work for a larger margin because they don't do the volume that we do, so by the time it gets to somebody's plate that box of tomatoes could cost \u00a310.\" There were times before the UK voted to leave the EU when he could buy tomatoes from the Netherlands for \u00a32, he says. BBC Radio 4's You and Yours spoke to several traders with similar stories - reporting price hikes of up to 40%. Brian Wilde is from J&B Wilde which has been selling fish, meat and poultry for more than a century. \"It is very difficult, because we buy quite a lot of produce out of the UK,\" he says. While imports are more expensive, of course the pound's fall also makes UK exports cheaper. But that also makes sourcing produce harder as well, says Brian. \"Produce in the UK is getting sent abroad because it's worth more for those fishing for the fish to send it abroad.\" His sister, Mariella, says: \"All our prices, for anything from outside this country, have gone up. Our average profits have fallen by up to 15%. We cannot pass that on.\" Traders say they try to absorb as much of this extra cost as they can but that might change soon. Darryl Laycock, from Sale Fish and Seafood in south Manchester, says the price of his sea bass has gone up 10%. \"I haven't passed it on yet, but I think the margins are getting so tight, I am going to have to start looking at different prices on certain products,\" he says.

{"article": "The framework agreement, struck after intensive talks, aims to prevent Tehran making a nuclear weapon in exchange for phased sanction relief. Iran and the six world powers involved must now finalise the deal. Iranians have been celebrating in the streets but Israel says the deal threatens its survival. \"This will be a long-term deal, that addresses each path to a potential Iranian nuclear bomb,\" the US President said in a statement after the deal was announced. \"If Iran cheats, the world will know it,\" he said, adding that the agreement was based not on trust but on \"unprecedented verification\". He said that if the deal is finalised, \"we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security, and to do so peacefully\". According to \"parameters\" of the agreement published by the US state department, Iran must reduce the number of its centrifuges that can be used to enrich uranium into a bomb by more than two-thirds. It also has to redesign a power plant so it cannot produce weapons-grade plutonium, be subject to regular inspections, and agree not to enrich uranium over 3.67% - far less than is required to make a nuclear bomb - for at least 15 years. \"There's new state of the art technology that will be used,\" US Secretary of State John Kerry told the BBC. \"We will have tracking of their uranium from the cradle to the grave.\" There's been celebration through the night across Iran and a hero's welcome for Foreign Minister Javad Zarif. But the deal he's brought home has been dismissed by hardliners who say Iran surrendered too much in exchange for too little. John Kerry also faces a mix of support and scepticism in the US Congress. The loudest condemnation has come from Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu, who insists this deal doesn't block but helps Iran build a nuclear bomb. As hard as it was to reach this preliminary agreement, it will be even harder to draft a final deal by the end of June. But, if negotiators do it, it will be a victory for diplomacy which, they believe will make the world a much safer place. A deal that buys time . The framework agreement was announced by the European Union and Iran after eight days of intense negotiations in the Swiss city of Lausanne. Western powers have long distrusted Iran's assertions that its nuclear programme is peaceful. The talks at Lausanne's Beau-Rivage Palace hotel between Iran and the so-called P5+1 - the US, UK, France, China and Russia plus Germany - continued beyond the original, self-imposed deadline of 31 March. The Iranian foreign minister, Javid Zarif, called it a \"win-win outcome\", but warned: \"We have taken a major step, but are still some way away from where we want to be.\" The parties have set a deadline of 30 June to reach a comprehensive pact, but these negotiations are expected to be tougher than those that led to the framework agreement. Even so, there was jubilation overnight on the streets of Tehran. If the deal is implemented it should mean the eventual lifting of sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy. Unusually, the US President's speech was aired live on Iranian state television, with some Iranians taking \"selfies\" with Mr Obama as a backdrop. There was anger though from Israel, whose leader Benjamin Netanyahu has been a vocal critic of Iran and told President Obama the deal threatened the survival of Israel. The Israeli prime minister said it would \"increase the risks of nuclear proliferation and the risks of a horrific war\", according to his spokesman. In the US, the deal has been criticised by members of Congress who want US lawmakers to have the right to review any final agreement. US House Speaker John Boehner said the deal represented an \"alarming departure\" from Mr Obama's original goals and that Congress should review the deal before sanctions on Iran were lifted.", "abstract": "President Obama has hailed a deal restricting Iran's nuclear programme as a \"historic understanding\" which, if implemented, will make world safer.", "candidate": "US President Barack Obama has hailed a preliminary agreement on Iran's nuclear programme.", "doc_id": 2608, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "A preliminary agreement on Iran's nuclear programme will cause problems.", "evidence": "As hard as it was to reach this preliminary agreement, it will be even harder to draft a final deal by the end of June.", "explanation": "Obama didn't directly hail the agreement or make comment about it in the source.", "instruction": "Remove the information about Obama being the one that hailed the program from the summary.

{"article": "Groups pushing for the impeachment of Brazil's President Dilma Rousseff are using a large rubber duck as a mascot. But the design is similar to one by Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman, who told the BBC the Brazilian replica constitutes copyright infringement. The owner of the factory that produced both ducks denied any wrongdoing. Versions of the same giant inflatable rubber duck designed by Mr Hofman have travelled the world since 2007, calling in Japan, New Zealand and Brazil, among many other countries. The version that has appeared in protests in Brazil closely resembles Mr Hofman's, although it has crosses for eyes. It also has the slogan \"Chega de pagar o pato\" across its chest, a Portuguese expression meaning \"We won't pay for the duck any more\" or \"We won't pay for what is not our fault any more\". The giant duck was commissioned by a powerful Brazilian industrial group, FIESP, to use in protests against corruption and high taxes from last September. But it has made a number of appearances in demonstrations against the president in recent months. \"It is exactly our design and our specific technical patterns,\" Mr Hofman told BBC Brasil. \"Changing the eyes doesn't change our technical design of the shape and beak.\" Before it appeared as part of an exhibition in Brazil, a version of Mr Hofman's duck was produced in a Sao Paulo factory. The owner of the factory, Denilson Sousa, told the BBC they also produced the new duck, but said the design was not copied. \"I would not put our reputation at risk,\" he said. \"We have experience in this kind of job and this is a very simple design. Why wouldn't we spend four hours redesigning it?\" But Mr Hofman said the factory \"made a very unwise decision\" and that he considered it \"illegal use of the exact design and therefore copyright infringement\". A FIESP spokesman said they had been reassured the design was original. On Tuesday, the group released 5,000 rubber ducks near the main national congress building in the capital, Brasilia, and took out full-page adverts in national newspapers using an image of a duck. Opposition lawmakers want to remove Ms Rousseff over claims she manipulated government accounts to hide a growing deficit.

ACW chairman Prof Dai Smith said it had been a \"challenging\" process but a third of organisations - mostly smaller arts groups - will not see any cut. Opera, theatre and dance companies, as well as educational groups and arts centres, will be finding out about their proposed budgets for 2016/17. The funding announcement is the final stage of ACW's investment review, the first in five years. It has now decided how many companies should continue to receive regular core funding, and how much they deserve. ACW has created a new Arts Portfolio Wales which sees 67 companies receiving funding for their core work, while two organisations receive lottery funding for specific projects and events. Companies which receive less than \u00a3150,000 have been protected from any cuts.

A third said they felt under pressure to become larger, and two-thirds expressed fears that they might inherit debt. The Department of Health said it expected parts of the NHS to work together to resolve any deficits. The survey was organised by NHS Alliance and the National Association of Primary Care, which have joined forces to represent CCGs, who will take over buying and organising NHS services. 36% of GPs and other leaders who responded to the survey said they were under pressure from NHS managers to become bigger, so they could pass a viability test next month. And 67% suspect they will have to deal with some legacy debt from former primary care trusts (PCTs) when the new system begins in England in April 2013. Dr Michael Dixon, who heads the NHS Alliance, said: \"Having a board with other clinical representatives and allowing for audit will be expensive. \"So the CCGs need to reach a critical mass in terms of size. But there's a risk of ending up recreating the old system of 150 primary care trusts. \"We're very concerned about the possibility of debts. My GP leaders don't want to be in the position of decommissioning services. \"It's been accepted that the CCGs shouldn't inherit deficits. But in practical terms, the squeeze on NHS finances is greater than people realise. \"Savings can be made in reducing referrals by GPs - but that won't achieve all the efficiencies that are needed. \"So there's concern not just about deficits but also the ongoing savings that are needed - and whether the CCGs will have sufficient budgets.

Mr Mbabazi is running against President Yoweri Museveni in next week's polls. Amin's rule was notorious for its brutality. He was overthrown in 1979 and died in exile in 2003. An armed forces chief under President Milton Obote, Amin seized power in a coup in 1971. He ordered the expulsion of Uganda's Asian community a year later. He became infamous for his capricious behaviour and for his punishment of political opponents. Some 400,000 people are estimated to have been killed while he was in power. Amin fled Uganda in 1979, seeking refuge in Libya, Iraq and eventually Saudi Arabia, where he would remain for the rest of his life. Mr Mbabazi made his promise to repatriate Amin's remains on a visit to the former dictator's ancestral home in north-west Uganda. His spokeswoman said his party was campaigning for reconciliation and for the \"forgiveness for any real or perceived wrongs in the past\". \"The issue of Idi Amin is one of them,\" she told the AFP news agency.

{"article": "The Kyrgyz National Security Committee (GKNB) named the prime suspect as Akbarzhon Jalilov, a 22-year-old with Russian citizenship, born in the Kyrgyz city of Osh in 1995. He is thought to be among the dead. The hunt is on for possible accomplices. Russian officials suspect that he had links to so-called Islamic State (IS). So far few details have emerged about Jalilov. There are unconfirmed reports that he was an ethnic Uzbek. Russia's State Investigative Committee said \"an explosive device could have been detonated by a man whose body parts were found in the third carriage of the train.\" \"The man has been identified but his identity will not be disclosed for now in the interests of the investigation,\" the statement added. The bomb blew up in a train carriage which had just left Sennaya Ploshchad station. The driver managed to continue to Tekhnologichesky Institut station. Later a similar device was found propped up against a wall at another city metro station, Ploshchad Vosstaniya. The Russian news website Gazeta.ru reports that the bombs were concealed in car fire extinguishers, with ball bearings taped to the outside. The one which exploded is said to have been carried in a rucksack. Reports say Jalilov had been living in St Petersburg for six years and had used several passports. He had worked as a chef in a St Petersburg sushi restaurant, Gazeta reported. Kyrgyz investigators are working with Russian authorities on the case. Reuters news agency spoke to people in Osh who said Jalilov was from an ethnic Uzbek family. They said they knew his parents but had not seen him for years. They said his father worked as a panel-beater in a car repair shop. IS has recruited many Islamist militants from Central Asian republics and from Chechnya in the North Caucasus. Russian aircraft and cruise missiles have targeted IS and other rebel groups in Syria - a vital intervention for embattled Syrian government forces. Osh - Kyrgyzstan's second-largest city - was the scene of inter-ethnic clashes between Uzbeks and Kyrgyz in June 2010, in which hundreds of people died.

{"article": "In mid-May, Gen Gholamreza Jalali, the head of Iran's Civil Defence Organisation, said he saw the mainly Sunni kingdom as his chief threat in the coming year. Mainly Shia Iran and Saudi Arabia have long been regional rivals but tensions worsened dramatically last year, partly because of the conflicts in Syria and Yemen. Within days of Gen Jalali's remarks, Iranian and Saudi hackers were attacking websites in each other's countries in what Iranian media called \"all-out cyberwar\". On 25 May, a self-proclaimed hacker from Saudi Arabia calling himself \"Da3s\" apparently attacked the websites of Iran's Statistical Centre and Registration Office, defacing the homepages with a photo of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who fought an eight-year war with Iran in the 1980s. Many Iranian media sources thought the hacker had misspelled his name and that the attack was the work of the Sunni jihadist group Islamic State - widely known in the Middle East by its Arabic acronym, \"Daesh\". The Saudi hacker said on Twitter - where he identified himself as Salman al-Harbi - that he was not a member of the militant group, and that Da3s was the correct spelling of his nickname. Since the Stuxnet computer worm hit Iran's nuclear facilities in 2010, the country has invested heavily in cyber capabilities and set up a team of trained hackers known as the Iranian Cyber-Army. Saudi Arabia has also stepped up its investment in cybersecurity in the past year in efforts spearheaded by its National Centre for Cyber-Security. A day after Da3s's attacks, a group calling itself \"Iran Security Team\" retaliated by targeting Saudi Arabia's General Authority for Statistics and King Abdulaziz University, defacing their websites with a jeering message of its own. Another team of Iranian hackers, calling themselves \"Digital Boys Underground Team\", hacked the Saudi Commerce Ministry's website. Over the next few days, a series of apparently tit-for-tat attacks saw more websites targeted, almost all of which were defaced or rendered inaccessible by attacks. Iran's police and cyber-police force, its judiciary, national postal service and culture ministry were all targeted. There is no evidence that official organisations in either state have been directly involved in the attacks. Iran's cyber-police chief, Gen Kamal Hadinafar, said the hackers' IP addresses had been traced back to Saudi Arabia but he did not accuse the Saudi authorities. As the attacks continued, the messages left by hackers became increasingly political and hostile. Tension between the two countries rose further when Saudi Arabia executed a prominent Shia cleric and opposition figure in January. Protesters in Tehran ransacked and set alight the Saudi embassy. Riyadh responded by severing all diplomatic ties with Iran. With relations at an all-time low, Tehran announced a few days ago that it would bar its citizens from attending this year's Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca) after negotiations over safety broke down. Last year, more than 400 Iranian pilgrims had died in a stampede, leading to a war of words between Iranian and Saudi officials. After hacking the website of Iran's foreign ministry, a hacker group calling itself \"Team Bad Dream\" branded the Iranian government the \"mother of terrorism\" and demanded an end to the \"killing of children in Iraq, Yemen and Syria\". The group tweeted that a \"cyberwar\" between Iranian and Saudi hackers had begun. In his latest attacks, Da3s pointed to the Yemen conflict and castigated the Iranian authorities for boycotting the Hajj. \"Why is Iran forbidding Muslims from attending this year's Hajj? Relations between states are unrelated to freedom of religion!\" Iranian hackers hit back by highlighting the long-standing dispute over the naming of the Gulf. Some Arab states refer to the body of water as the Arabian Gulf, but many Iranians see the name Persian Gulf as a source of national pride and object to any other form of words, including \"the Gulf\".

{"article": "Recep Tayyip Erdogan said voters had chosen stability following unrest. With almost all ballots counted, state-run Anadolu news agency said the AKP had won 49.4% of the vote, with the main opposition CHP on 25.4%. European observers have criticised the government for stifling media freedom. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said violence, especially in the country's south-east, had also had a significant impact on the election. Meanwhile, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) went further and denounced the entire process as \"unfair\". President Erdogan hailed the result early on Monday, saying: \"The national will manifested itself on 1 November in favour of stability.\" But he also attacked media criticism of him and called for global recognition of the election result. \"Now a party with some 50% [of the vote] in Turkey has attained power...

Lira strengthens after result . Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu will now begin the process of forming a new government. Mr Erdogan called the second general election this year after his AKP lost its parliamentary majority for the first time in 13 years in June and attempts to form a coalition failed. The pro-Kurdish HDP crossed the 10% threshold needed to claim seats in parliament, but it got 21 fewer MPs than in June's election. The nationalist MHP's share of the vote also declined, to 11.9%, and commentators suggested it had lost voters to the AKP. Reported results also showed: . Clashes were reported in the mainly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir, in the south-east of Turkey, as the results were being counted. Reuters said police had fired tear gas at protesters throwing stones. Since elections in June, a ceasefire between the Turkish army and militants from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) has collapsed. Critics have accused Mr Erdogan of renewing violence to curb support for the HDP - something the government denies. In a statement on Monday, Ignacio Sanchez Amor, head of the OSCE observer mission, said: \"Physical attacks on party members, as well as the significant security concerns, particularly in the south-east... imposed restrictions on the ability to campaign.\" He added that pressure on journalists - including a police raid on the Koza-Ipek media group in Istanbul last week - was a major concern. Meanwhile Andreas Gross, head of the PACE delegation, said: \"Unfortunately, the campaign for these elections was characterised by unfairness and, to a serious degree, fear.\" HDP co-chair Selahattin Demirtas said on Sunday that it had not been \"a fair or equal election\". The party suspended campaigning after a bombing in Ankara last month killed more than 100 people. The government said the attackers were linked to the Islamic State (IS) group. Violence has escalated in Turkey since a suicide bombing in July by suspected IS militants. The attack near the border with Syria killed more than 30 Kurds. Turkish newspaper front pages reflect the contrasting euphoria and gloom from government supporters and opponents at the election result. \"Ballot box revolution\" declares Sabah, echoed by Aksam's \"November revolution\". Pro-Islamist papers are equally jubilant, with Yeni Safak hailing a \"magnificent victory\", and Yeni Akit offering \"congratulations to the Muslim world\".

{"article": "The 28-year-old MTN-Qhubeka rider maintained his 13-second lead over Team Sky's Wouter Poels on Sunday's 14-lap final stage around central London. Team Sky's Elia Viviani was awarded the stage win after Andre Greipel, who crossed the line first, was penalised. Owain Doull, riding for Team Wiggins, was the highest placed Briton in third. The Welshman finished 10th on the stage but picked up bonus seconds in the intermediate sprint to leapfrog Rasmus Guldhammer to end the race 42 seconds behind Boasson Hagen and also win the points classification. Germany's Griepel beat Viviani by milimetres in Saturday's penultimate stage and was again first over the finish line on Sunday. However, the Lotto-Soudal rider was adjudged to have impeded Viviani in the sprint for the line and was relegated to the back of the bunch by race officials. \"I didn't see Viviani coming,\" said Greipel. \"Everybody was on the limit on the final corner. I didn't do anything for purpose that's for sure. That's sprinting.\" After winning his third stage of the race, Italian Viviani, who crossed the finish line with his hand in the air in complaint, said: \"He came across a little bit and that edged me towards the barriers. \"I'm disappointed because it is better to win without this but we won in London and that is the main thing.\" Stage eight result: . 1.

{"article": "Armstrong was stripped of his yellow jerseys for doping by cycling's governing body on Monday. \"The management committee decided not to award victories to any other rider or upgrade other placings in any of the affected events,\" said a UCI statement. American Armstrong crossed the line first every year between 1999 and 2005. The UCI acknowledged that \"a cloud of suspicion would remain hanging over this dark period - but that while this might appear harsh for those who rode clean, they would understand there was little honour to be gained in reallocating places\". The body has also ordered Armstrong and others to pay back all prize money from this period, and has commissioned an independent investigation into the whole Armstrong affair. Pending the results of the report, defamation proceedings against Paul Kimmage, a former cyclist and Sunday Times journalist, have been suspended. The statement added: \"The committee agreed that part of the independent commission's remit would be to find ways to ensure that persons caught for doping were no longer able to take part in the sport, including as part of an entourage.\" Armstrong, 41, and his United States Postal Service team ran \"the most sophisticated, professionalised and successful doping programme that sport has ever seen\", a 1,000-page United States Anti-Doping Agency report concluded. In the report, it was also claimed that Armstrong paid the UCI $100,000 (\u00a362,300) for the fight against anti-doping. Floyd Landis, a former colleague of Armstrong's who now admits to using drugs, claims this was hush money to cover up a positive test for the banned substance EPO that was collected from Armstrong during his victory at the Tour of Switzerland in 2001. The UCI admitted it received money from Armstrong in 2002, but said in 2010 that this was not part of a cover-up. BBC Sport understands that at Friday's UCI management committee hearing there was an attempt by more than one member to force honorary president Hein Verbruggen to resign, but it did not gain enough support and failed. Verbruggen and president Pat McQuaid, who has been asked to resign in an open letter by America's three-time Tour de France winner Greg LeMond, have come under intense pressure to stand aside in the wake of the Armstrong scandal. There was no attempt to get McQuaid to quit. McQuaid said the governing body are \"determined to turn around this painful episode in the history of our sport\". \"We will take whatever actions are deemed necessary by the independent commission and we will put cycling back on track,\" said McQuaid. \"Today, cycling is a completely different sport from what it was in the period 1998-2005. \"Riders are now subject to the most innovative and effective anti-doping procedures and regulations in sport. \"Nevertheless, we have listened to the world's reaction to the Lance Armstrong affair and have taken these additional decisive steps in response to the grave concerns raised.\" World anti-doping body Wada said it backed the UCI's decision to create an independent review commission. British Cycling president Brian Cookson said: \"The UCI has taken another worthwhile step in its response to the Usada investigation into Lance Armstrong. \"I can assure everyone that my UCI management committee colleagues and I are unanimous in our determination that this independent commission will just be the start of the process and nothing will be off the agenda. \"Cycling must and will learn the lessons of the Armstrong era.\"", "abstract": "Lance Armstrong's seven Tour de France titles will not be awarded to any other riders, the International Cycling Union has announced.", "candidate": "The International Cycling Union (UCI) has stripped Lance Armstrong of his seven Tour de France titles.", "doc_id": 1634, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "The UCI has stripped Lance Armstrong of his yellow jerseys.", "evidence": "Armstrong was stripped of his yellow jerseys for doping by cycling's governing body on Monday.", "explanation": "The organization is only referred to as UCI, the designation \"titles\" is not used and the number seven is not given.

This was an increase of 1,435 GWh on the first quarter of 2011. Scotland is aiming to generate the equivalent of 100% of its electricity needs from renewables by 2020. The UK Department of Energy and Climate Change also issued revised statistics for 2011 which showed that renewable electricity generation in Scotland was 13,735 GWh in 2011, an increase of 44.3% from 2010 and up 97.3% from 2006. The Scottish government said that, assuming gross consumption in 2011 was similar to 2010, about 35% of Scotland's electricity needs came from renewables in 2011, beating its interim target of 31%. Scottish Energy Minister Fergus Ewing said the figures showed the country was making good progress towards the 2020 target.

They enjoy free trade with each other, but must impose the same tariffs on goods from nations outside the pact and are barred from doing bilateral trade deals with other countries.

{"article": "Chris Murphy was granted leave to pursue a judicial review of the A6 upgrade. It is the first stage in a bid to halt the \u00c2\u00a3160m dual carriageway because of concerns over the impact on wildlife in and around Lough Neagh and Lough Beg. A judge has ruled the challenge should proceed to a full hearing in 2017. The A6 is the main Belfast to Londonderry road and is heavily used. Mr Murphy, an ornithologist, was granted leave in the High Court to seek a judicial review over an alleged breach of a directive on a specially protected area close to a section of the Toome to Castledawson stretch of the upgrade. The A6 upgrade would also run through a landscape made famous by Heaney including an area near Mossbawn, County Londonderry, the former Nobel laureate's childhood home. Mr Murphy said Heaney's work was fundamental to the area's landscape. \"The wild and the wet inspired him and he immortalised it in his work,\" he said. \"You have got dozens of places in his poetry that will be destroyed by the impact of the noise of a motorway so close to Mossbawn\". The environmentalist issued proceedings after the upgrade was given the go ahead by Northern Ireland's Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard. At Thursday's hearing, a judge said there was still uncertainty surrounding checks to determine the disturbance to wildlife in and around Lough Neagh and Lough Beg. The judge held that an arguable case has been established on an alleged breach of the habitats directive that gives protected status to both Loughs. He noted that further assessments have been carried out since the department first made checks on the presence of nesting birds, badgers and bats, and to ensure minimisation of disturbance to whooper swans. But the judge said he was unclear whether these actions were part of a fulfilment of the habitats directive obligations. \"The court is left wondering about the impact or otherwise of the checks being carried out,\" he said. The judge said that any concerns may be eased once further information is supplied. However, he ruled that the challenge should proceed to a full hearing early next year. \"There's substantial public interest involved in a case like this,\" he said. \"Stopping a major road project is a matter of considerable importance.\" The disputed route for the dual carriageway was identified following a public inquiry nearly a decade ago.", "abstract": "An environmental campaigner has got permission to challenge a proposed new road through landscape made famous by poet Seamus Heaney.", "candidate": "A landscape made famous by poet Seamus Heaney could be destroyed by a major road upgrade, a environmentalist has claimed.", "doc_id": 3663, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "A landscape made famous by poet Heaney could be destroyed by a major road upgrade, a environmentalist has claimed.", "evidence": "The A6 upgrade would also run through a landscape made famous by Heaney including an area near Mossbawn, County Londonderry, the former Nobel laureate's childhood home.", "explanation": "Heaney's first name was not mentioned at all.", "instruction": "Remove the information about Heaney's first name \"Seamus\" from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about Heaney's first name \"Seamus\" from the summary."]}}

{"article": "John Whittingdale was speaking on BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show after launching a debate on what types of programmes the BBC should make. Of Strictly, he said: \"The BBC took a risk. It paid off well and it has achieved a mass audience. \"And that seems to me admirable if you can do all those things.\" The government published a Green Paper on the future of the BBC on Thursday, including the question of whether the corporation should be \"chasing ratings\" or delivering \"distinctive, quality\" programmes that are unavailable on other channels. That has led to some suggestions that the BBC could stop showing Saturday night light entertainment programmes. Asked about the difference between Strictly and the BBC's long-running Generation Game, Mr Whittingdale said: \"Saturday night has always been a time when families sit around the television and we traditionally have had light entertainment shows. \"In many ways, Strictly Come Dancing is the successor to The Generation Game. \"But Strictly was perhaps, at first sight of the commissioning editor, not necessarily a show which was going to be as successful as it has proved to be. \"So I think the BBC took a risk.

The show should certainly not compete for viewers with X Factor on ITV, he told the paper. On Sunday, Mr Whittingdale told Andrew Marr he was a \"huge admirer\" of the BBC. But he said he was \"a little surprised that the BBC expressed such disappointment at the Green Paper\". He said the document was \"just a series of questions with no answers as yet decided\".

{"article": "This Central American nation has often been in the middle of events with an impact far beyond its borders, from the engineering marvel that is the Panama Canal to the country's many political storms. Even so, people here have reacted with surprise - and indignation - after seeing their country's name linked to a hashtag that is shaking the world. For many locals, to talk about #PanamaPapers is in itself an injustice, as the name tarnishes the whole country with an alleged complicity in international tax evasion. They claim the accusations should instead be directed at a minuscule segment of their society. And anyway, they insist, the Panamanian companies involved were not doing anything different to firms in other financial capitals across the world. Panama is indeed a large and sophisticated offshore financial centre, whose companies help manage, in one way or another, large fortunes from all corners of the planet. But how does all of that money impact the everyday life of normal Panamanians? For a visitor, the prosperity of parts of the country is evident from the moment the plane flies over the capital, affording the first glimpse of Panama City from above. The city centre is so ostentatious that a Trump luxury hotel tower, 284 metres high and until 2012 the tallest building in Latin America, goes almost unnoticed among the dozens of skyscrapers crowding the horizon. Some people say it reminds them of Dubai, others say it looks like Miami. Panama City has done a good job in attracting cash to the country, home to just four million people and with relatively few natural resources other than its geographic location. The financial sector is key to the country's wealth, representing around 7% of GDP. And in a business where reputation is everything, many fear the effect the scandal could have on the industry's future growth. But Rafael, the taxi driver who takes me from the airport into the city centre, does not necessarily see it as his problem. He views it as a quarrel among elites. \"It is a white people's dance,\" he says disdainfully. He will not give me his full name, objecting that \"you never know who you are talking to\". But after a few minutes of conversation, he acknowledges his own life has been closely affected by the financial industry's ups and downs. He says he worked with one of the many Western banks that came to Panama during the 1970s boom, when Latin America was awash in petrodollars and the country helped manage many of the region's fortunes. But in the 1980s the petrodollars vanished. Panama was stigmatised as a money laundering centre for drug cartels, the bank left, and he ended up without a job. The financial sector eventually recovered and is now a central part of the economy, together with the Panama Canal, helping the country become more prosperous than most of its neighbours. With this wellbeing threatened, it is no wonder that political and business leaders in Panama treat the scandal as little less than an act of foreign aggression against the nation. La Estrella, one of the main local newspapers, carried a front page headline claiming that \"The Panama Papers are a global attack against the financial system\". \"The criticism Panama is getting is unfair. It is media sensationalism,\" Gian Castillero, an adviser to the foreign ministry, says. This week's revelations on the mechanisms used by the rich and famous to hide their fortunes refer to multiple jurisdictions, he claims, but the world is only focusing on one: Panama. \"There is no supervision problem in the government of Panama,\" he insists, adding that the country has submitted to several international benchmarking processes on its standards. \"There is a commitment to transparency.\" On social media, some Panamanians have undertaken a likely quixotic crusade to change the #PanamaPapers hashtag to one that is less compromising of their country's reputation.", "abstract": "Although a very small country, Panama is used to getting attention, for reasons good and bad.", "candidate": "The Panama Papers scandal is not the first time Panama has been in the news.", "doc_id": 3300, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "The Panama Papers scandal is not the first time Panama has been in the middle of events.", "evidence": "This Central American nation has often been in the middle of events with an impact far beyond its borders, from the engineering marvel that is the Panama Canal to the country's many political storms.", "explanation": "The idea that the scandal is not the first time Panama has been in the news is too much of an inference to be directly supported.", "instruction": "Replace the information about has been in the news with the information about has been in the middle of events.", "instruction_list": ["Replace the information about has been in the news with the information about has been in the middle of events."]}}

He did not enter a plea to the charges and is due to appear in court again on 7 June. President Donald Trump has tweeted that last week's attack was \"unacceptable\". Portland's mayor is meanwhile trying to ban a forthcoming right-wing rally in the West Coast city. The attack unfolded on Friday afternoon after the suspect began spewing \"hate speech\" towards two young women on a train, police said. Taliesin Namkai-Meche, 23, and Ricky Best, 53, intervened and were fatally stabbed at the Hollywood Transit Center train station, said investigators. Another man, Micah David-Cole Fletcher, was slashed in the neck and is recovering. He was in court on Tuesday to see Jeremy Joseph Christian's appearance. Destinee Mangum, 16, said she had been with a friend wearing a hijab on the first night of Ramadan - Islam's holiest month - when the suspect targeted them. \"He told us to go back to Saudi Arabia, and he told us we shouldn't be here, to get out of his country,\" she told KPTV-TV. \"He was just telling us that we basically weren't anything and that we should kill ourselves.\" The mother of Namkai-Meche, Asha Deliverance, took to Facebook to write an open letter to President Donald Trump, urging him to \"take action\". \"Your words and actions are meaningful, here in America and throughout the world,\" she wrote. \"Please encourage all Americans to protect and watch out for one another. Please condemn any acts of violence, which result directly from hate speech & hate groups. \"I am praying you will use your leadership to do so.\" Detectives say they are investigating Mr Christian's background of extremist ideology. At a \"Free Speech\" rally in Portland on 29 April, police confiscated a baseball bat he had allegedly been using to threaten liberal protesters. Mr Christian was later filmed performing a Nazi salute, and shouting racial epithets while wearing an American flag as a cape. On his Facebook page he has praised Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and posted a death threat against Hillary Clinton. And he wrote: \"If Donald Trump is the Next Hitler then I am joining his SS\". Mr Christian has also voiced support for Senator Bernie Sanders, the Wall Street-bashing, 2016 Democratic presidential candidate. According to the Oregonian newspaper, Mr Christian pleaded guilty in 2002 to robbing and kidnapping the owner of a store. In 2010 he was charged with theft and being a felon in possession of a firearm. Mayor Ted Wheeler said he welcomed the president's tweet on Monday condemning the attack. But he urged the federal government to revoke a permit for a \"Trump Free Speech Rally\" scheduled for this weekend in Portland.

{"article": "Concerned that their messages may be intercepted, the leadership has also banned members from using smart phones. The group has long run what is regarded as a slick media machine. Even without smart phones, it has been known for its sophisticated handling of social media, a reputation at odds with its regular bans on communication technology for Somali citizens. In particular, it has made extensive use of Twitter in order to get its message across. It has also devoted considerable resources to producing a series of promotional videos. Al-Shabab's material aims to spread the group's ideology of establishing an Islamic state in Somalia, in line with al-Qaeda's stated ambition of setting up a global Islamic caliphate. It wants to achieve this both by military conquest and also the conversion of souls - for which communication technology is a key tool. Al-Shabab's well-produced video documentaries deliver the jihadi narrative in an appealing form to Somali audiences in the diaspora. They are aimed at young people of Somali origin such as Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow, a suspect in last year's Westgate mall attack in Kenya. His family is said to have moved to Norway as refugees in 1999. The group's documentaries are produced by its media arm, the al-Kataib foundation. Many of them show al-Shabab engaging in charity work and other activities that depict the group as a legitimate authority. However, they can also be quite gruesome - showing the corpses of those they have killed, including alleged spies who are often beheaded. And they contain threats to their perceived enemies - in Somalia, neighbouring countries such as Kenya which are helping Somalia's government and the West. The videos portray al-Shabab's fight as part of a wider global conflict in which Islam is under threat. Al-Shabab also has its own radio station, Radio Andalus. The group has acquired half a dozen relay stations, mainly by seizing private radio stations such as HornAfrik, Holy Koran Radio and the Global Broadcasting Corporation radio and their equipment - including some from the BBC. The website Kismaayo News reported that by 2013, the group had 50 journalists working for Andalus radio. When it comes to recruiting presenters, al-Shabab is known for its attention to detail. It generally takes care to use presenters with British or American accents to deliver its English language audio statements. With statements in Arabic, standard Arabic is used, and the presenters clearly have a high level of education in the language and in Islamic texts. Swahili-language presenters use classical Kiswahili as spoken in Tanzania and coastal Kenya. The majority of al-Shabab's audio output, though, is in Somali and is presented articulately and fluently. A number of pro-al-Shabab websites have emerged, which host material produced by the group and act as vehicles for furthering its military aims. The content is intended to frustrate efforts by the Somali government and its allies - mainly the African Union forces fighting in Somalia - to eliminate the group. Al-Shabab has often used Twitter to challenge the veracity of claims made by the African Union forces. Its Twitter accounts are now closed, but Kenya's military spokesman Maj-Gen Chirchir has continued to attack the group's media policy. On 20 May he tweeted: \"Al Shabaab Courtesy calls! The more videos you release to scare Kenyans the more WE make visitations. Consider peace, the better option.\" When the group's official spokesman, Sheikh Ali Dheere, appears on video, he is surrounded by fighters. He reportedly answers to the group's overall leader and oversees a bevy of apparently enthusiastic journalists. Al-Shabab has honed its media strategy as aggressively as it has enforced its bans on the Somali population. As the group loses control of parts of the country, it has issued a series of bans on technology: . BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

{"article": "They were allegedly subject to sexual abuse and forced to beg on the streets. The owner, Rosa del Carmen Verduzco, and eight employees at the House of the Big Family have been arrested. Correspondents say it is one of Mexico's worst incidents of alleged child abuse at a children's institution in many years. The government said the building was home to 278 boys, 174 girls and six infants under the age of three. Also rescued were 138 adults aged up to 40, the government said. Reports say the residents were forced to live in terrible conditions. \"I'm in utter dismay because we weren't expecting the conditions we found at the group home,\" Michoacan Governor Salvador Jara said. The House of the Big Family has been operating for 40 years and was known locally as Mama Rosa's Home. The authorities began to investigate the home after parents complained that they were denied access to their children. One woman, who grew up at the home herself, gave birth to two children who were registered in the name of Ms Verduzco. When the mother left the home, aged 31, she was not allowed to take her children with her, investigators said. Mr Jara said the raid came after an official complaint was filed by the parents of five children who said they were being held at the home against their will. He said the complaint was filed more than a year ago, but did not specify why the authorities had not acted sooner. Local media had reported on allegations made against the home as far back as 2010. By Will Grant, BBC Mundo, Mexico City . Mexicans are waking up to the news with a sense of shock and disbelief - mainly at the sheer scale of the alleged abuse at Casa Mama Rosa. The list of accusations is long and serious: almost 500 children held against their will and sent into the streets to beg, their parents prevented fromt them, sexual and psychological abuse at what is a well-known and often praised children's home. As such, this certainly stands out from other stories of abuse in Mexican institutions and has sparked some uncomfortable questions. How long were the authorities aware of the accusations before they acted? Were corrupt officials involved in keeping those accusations silent? Meanwhile Rosa Verduzco herself is under arrest and facing a range of charges including sexual abuse and mistreatment of children. But over the 40 years she has been running the home, she has gained some influential and high-profile supporters, among them the renowned Mexican writer Enrique Krauze, who took to Twitter to defend her record. An article in newspaper El Universal said six families had alleged that Ms Verduzco refused to hand over their children to them. One mother told Universal reporters that she had taken her son to the home after a social worker had recommended it as a place for her child to get treatment for hyperactivity. The mother, Martha Ines Lopez Ramirez, said she was only allowed to see her son once every four months and only ever in the presence of a \"guard\". Ms Lopez said that her son seemed to have been drugged and showed signs of having been beaten. She told El Universal that all parents had been made to hand over custody of the children to Ms Verduzco, and sign a written agreement not to retrieve the children before they turned 18.

Mr Tutu came out in favour of assisted dying in 2014, without specifying if he personally wanted to have the choice. He was hospitalised last month for surgery to treat recurring infections. \"I hope I am treated with compassion and allowed to pass on to the next phase of life's journey in the manner of my choice,\" Mr Tutu wrote. \"Regardless of what you might choose for yourself, why should you deny others the right to make this choice? \"For those suffering unbearably and coming to the end of their lives, merely knowing that an assisted death is open to them can provide immeasurable comfort.\" There is no specific legislation in South Africa governing assisted dying. But in a landmark ruling in April 2015, a South African court granted a terminally ill man the right to die, prompting calls for a clarification of the laws in cases of assisted death. The Anglican Church - of which Mr Tutu is a member - is staunchly against assisted dying. This is not the first time Mr Tutu has come out against the church, however. He is an outspoken supporter of gay rights, and has openly criticised conservative Christian attitudes to homosexuality. In 2013, he said would \"refuse to go to a homophobic heaven\" in favour of \"the other place\". At the time, he added: \"I would not worship a God who is homophobic and that is how deeply I feel about this.\" Earlier this year, he blessed his daughter Mpho's marriage with her female partner, despite South African Anglican law on marriage stating that \"holy matrimony is the lifelong and exclusive union between one man and one woman\".

He was aided by Will Porterfield's 63 in an unbroken first-wicket stand. Northants struggled to 154 all out in their 30 overs, with Rob Keogh (64) the only one to make a real impression. England international Ben Duckett was caught by Hain for seven off the bowling of Rikki Clarke (2-18), one of seven Northants batsmen to fail to get out of single figures as Oliver Hannon-Dalby (3-24) impressed. Hain returned to the side having been left out of their previous County Championship game, on the day he received a reprimand from the ECB's Cricket Discipline Commission. He was reported by the umpires during Warwickshire's Second XI Championship match against Worcestershire at Flagge Meadow last week, for a Level One breach of the code (bowling a fast short pitched ball and/or accidental high full pitched ball that results in the bowler being disallowed from bowling any further in that innings). The penalty is a reprimand, which will remain on his record for two years. The accumulation of nine or more penalty points in any two-year period will result in an automatic suspension. Hain scored more runs in the One-Day Cup last season than any other batsman (540 in 10 innings). Northants coach David Ripley told BBC Radio Northampton: . \"We just haven't come out of the blocks at all. We've been very well beaten.

{"article": "Charlotte Bevan, who had schizophrenia, walked out of St Michael's Hospital in Bristol in December 2014 with daughter Zaani Tiana Bevan-Malbrouck. Their bodies were found in undergrowth in the Avon Gorge days later. The serious case review also found the lack of a lead clinician overseeing Ms Bevan's care led to confusion. The Bristol Safeguarding Children Board's report said there was a system for controlling entry to the ward \"but mothers and babies were allowed free access throughout the hospital\". It went on to say that, \"this allowed CB [Charlotte Bevan] to leave the ward with ZBM [Zaani Tiana Bevan-Malbrouck] unnoticed and unchallenged\". The report said once the alarm was raised that Ms Bevan and her four-day-old daughter were missing, there was a quick response. However, it said the safeguarding concerns were \"everybody's business\" as Ms Bevan was \"able to walk outside at night, in unsuitable clothing, carrying a newborn baby, in a public place unchallenged by anyone\". Since their deaths, the report said ward security had been \"reviewed and improved\" and changes had been made to the reception area. Charlotte's mother Rachel Fortune, who contributed to the review, said in a written statement \"no single thing, action or person was to blame\". In the statement, released jointly with her daughter Janet, she said there were eight main findings which offered \"clear, constructive learning\", including how to manage long-term mental health in pregnancy, \"honest, accurate and timely communication\" and how several agencies could work together with a lead clinician. She added: \"This was a particularly difficult case to manage as long-term ill mental health and pregnancy came together. It's our hope now that any families and individuals facing such difficulties will have a multi-agency team with accountable clinicians in each service, as they now do in Bristol.\" The review also found Ms Bevan's explanation for stopping her medication due to breastfeeding concerns was not followed up with a pharmacist until after she had given birth. She later revealed she had not been taking medication for the last five months of her pregnancy, which the review team speculated was a sign of \"disguised compliance\". The report said: \"It is notable that it was not until CB [Charlotte Bevan] had given birth to ZBM [Zaani Tiana Bevan-Malbrouck] that any professional contacted a pharmacist to confirm the safety of her medication on ZBM when breastfeeding or otherwise.\" There was also confusion over who was leading, co-ordinating and overseeing Charlotte's overall care, the report found. In some cases, it found, health professionals assumed it was the Mother and Baby Unit Doctor, the mental health care co-ordinator or her GP. The report also found there was confusion over the terminology in describing her mental health condition. It found that describing her as \"well\" meant there was no clarity in what this meant in mental health terms. Independent chair of the Bristol Safeguarding Children Board, Sally Lewis said: \"This review provides constructive learning for many agencies and professionals working in Bristol and beyond. \"A great deal has already changed in local professional practice since this tragic incident, some of which has been influenced by the findings of this review and has been noted by the Board in our formal response.\"", "abstract": "A mother who jumped off a cliff with her baby was able to leave a maternity ward unchallenged as she had \"free access\" in the hospital, a report said.", "candidate": "A mother and her newborn baby were \"unnoticed and unchallenged\" as they walked out of a hospital, a report has found.", "doc_id": 1729, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "It went on to say that, \"this allowed CB [Charlotte Bevan] to leave the ward with ZBM [Zaani Tiana Bevan-Malbrouck] unnoticed and unchallenged\".", "explanation": "The summary accurately stated the relationship of the person to the baby and the quote was cited in a report.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}
{"article": "The speech built on her article in The Times on Monday and is important for a number of reasons - not least its attempt to marry a general and widespread disillusion among the public that the economy \"is not working for them\" with a sense that the Conservative Party's driving philosophy is about more than free markets. The first of these is straight from the playbook of Mr Miliband; the second is from Lady Thatcher. Here's Mr Miliband at the time of the 2011 Labour Party conference where he announced plans to rein in \"excessive pay\". \"This is not an anti-business message, this is an anti-business as usual message,\" he told the Today programme. And here's Mrs May today, on her plans to tackle the \"unhealthy and growing gap\" between what she deliberately describes as \"bosses\" and \"workers\". \"It is not anti-business to suggest that big business needs to change,\" she said. Now, of course Mrs May would be likely to splutter into her morning cup of tea if there was any suggestion that Mr Miliband was guiding her politically. As she said in her speech this morning, the Home Secretary believes that Labour's approach to \"equality\" holds people back. And she insisted the Conservatives remained the party of enterprise. But Mrs May's pledges to put worker representatives on company boards (as well as \"consumers\"), to make shareholder votes on executive remuneration binding, to oblige companies to publish data on the pay multiple between a company's chief executive and the pay of the average worker, to have a \"proper industrial strategy\" that could be used to block takeovers such as Pfizer's attempt to buy AstraZeneca - all are certainly a substantial attempt to build the broadest of Tory tents. Further, they are a deliberate economic pitch for the centre ground of politics, to a level of detail many will be surprised by. Anyone who thought that a Conservative-led administration under Mrs May would not be interventionist when it comes to economic and business policy will certainly have to reconsider. Mrs May even had some words for policy makers at the Bank of England, saying that ultra-low interest rates had helped home owners over those struggling to clamber on the housing ladder. So, where does Lady Thatcher fit in? Rather more subtly, but still distinctly, in the line: \"We don't just believe in markets, but in communities.\" Lady Thatcher was clear on her distrust of \"big state\" solutions and spoke regularly of communities of people, even \"society\" despite the oft-quoted line that there was \"no such thing\". She said that people should be allowed to get on and should prosper, as long as they played by the rules. Mrs May appears to be echoing the sentiment, replacing the \"big state\" with \"big business\" and \"vested interests\". She vowed to take them on, tying a reformist line directly from Robert Peel to Joseph Chamberlain to Lady Thatcher. Mrs May also spoke of \"leading on behalf of the people\". Many argue that Brexit uncertainty will make the fortunes of the UK economy over the coming months and years difficult to forecast. Mrs May, launching herself as the UK's next prime minister, appears to want to be tested on whether that economy is seen as working for everyone.", "abstract": "In her speech this morning - which has now taken on far more weight given that she is just about ready to measure the curtains for Number 10 - Theresa May laid out a set of policies that bring together two strands of thinking and two personalities who would not have been overly comfortable in each other's company - Ed Miliband and Margaret Thatcher.", "candidate": "Home Secretary Theresa May's speech to the Conservative conference this morning is an important moment for the Conservative Party.", "doc_id": 1135, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Home Secretary May's speech to the Conservative conference this morning is an important moment for the Conservative Party", "evidence": "As she said in her speech this morning, the Home Secretary believes that Labour's approach to \"equality\" holds people back.", "explanation": "it makes up May's first name", "instruction": "Remove the information about May's first name from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about May's first name from the summary."]}}

{"article": "Latest figures released by EMAS reveal it has a \u00a38.74m deficit - 20 times higher than predicted. The NHS Trust Development Authority, which monitors trusts, said it was working closely with the service to help address financial pressures. EMAS said it has spent more on extra vehicles, staff, training and overtime payments. It had predicted an overspend of about \u00a3500,000 at the start of the year. The money problems at EMAS are getting worse. One of the biggest problems is handover delays to A&E because they're too busy to accept patients straight away. So far this year, more than 10,000 patients have had to wait more than an hour and because the ambulance service gets paid for each patient it takes to hospital, they are losing out. Also the NHS would like to treat more people at home, but of course it is a financial disincentive. Our busiest A&E department at Leicester Royal Infirmary is trying to sort it out, but I don't think there's any quick fix. EMAS claims it is owed \u00a32.6m in compensation for the handover delays, which has contributed to the overspend.

A spokesperson for the Scottish Children's Services Coalition, a network of support groups, said: \"The figures from NHS Lothian indicating that more than half of those who started their treatment between October and December had been waiting more than the Scottish government target of 18 weeks is clearly disappointing. \"In addition, of the 101 children and young people in Scotland who had been waiting for more than a year before they started treatment, these almost all relate to NHS Lothian. \"We know that half of all diagnosable mental health problems start before the age of 14 and 75% by the age of 21. \"As such it is vitally important that an action plan is put in place for NHS Lothian, radically improving mental health services and increasing investment in these, with an overall aim of ensuring that children and young people get the help they need, when they need it. \"A target of 18-weeks is in itself still far too long. \"Families usually experience months of waiting even before a referral to CAMHS. \"The consequent delay in diagnosis and appropriate support can lead to a crisis situation for the child or young person concerned, as well as for their family, and the need for costly extra resources to address this. \"We hope that NHS Lothian takes account of these figures and takes urgent action to address this matter.\" Alex McMahon, NHS Lothian's executive director of nursing, midwifery and allied health professionals, said: \"More young people than ever before are accessing mental health services and we have seen a steady rise in the number of children and young people being referred to our services. \"Unfortunately patients are having to wait longer than we would like and we are working hard to reduce this number. \"We have invested significantly in CAMHS over the years to support the delivery of expert services for children.

{"article": "Over six years, the Tackling FGM Initiative has given \u00c2\u00a32.8m of funding to community-based prevention schemes. It said in a report that the funding had helped spark a necessary debate about FGM. But it added that maintaining momentum would be difficult without more money. The initiative was set up by five charitable trusts, including Comic Relief, to discourage the cutting of girls' sexual organs. As well as funding the work of dozens of community groups, the money also paid for the training of more than 6,000 teachers and healthcare staff in how to spot and respond to the illegal act of female genital mutilation. Under the scheme, people were encouraged to work within their own communities. For example, a Somali elder in Bolton recruited other men in his community to emphasise the need to protect their daughters. But the Tackling FGM Initiative's report said there was still a lack of clarity over who should be funding future FGM prevention work. It said local authorities, health and wellbeing boards, and public health or clinical commissioning groups all had a part to play. The report says it is difficult to measure the success of preventing FGM because of the lack of data about an illegal procedure, but, using surveys, it found attitudes to FGM had changed. It concludes that awareness of FGM has increased, particularly among women, and there has been a strong focus on educating young people from a wide range of communities. But the report warns that funding is still the major barrier to ending mutilation and the authors say, in the current financial climate, it will be difficult to maintain progress.

The BBC's Duncan Kennedy said the buyer was believed to be British. Auctioneer Alan Aldridge said the violin was the \"rarest and most iconic\" piece of Titanic memorabilia. Many of the other items up for sale, such as photographs, newspapers and crockery, were sold for between \u00a310 and a few hundred pounds. By Duncan KennedyBBC News . What would Wallace Hartley have made of it all? Well, the modest, jobbing, musician from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire, would probably not have believed it. His violin, given to him by his fiancee, Maria, as an engagement present, going at auction for \u00a3900,000 (just over \u00a31m when you add in buyers premium and VAT). He'd only just got off the RMS Mauretania when his agent asked him if he wanted to go straight onto another voyage, the Titanic. Hartley agreed, a move that would cost him his life but also create a legend. There were gasps at the auction when the bidding passed half a million pounds. But it kept climbing, the bidders in the room soon over taken by the serious money on the phones. Any suggestion the violin wasn't authentic, as some have claimed, was swept away in a torrent of successively higher bids. In the end, it beat the old world record for a single Titanic item four times over. Played by a man who personifies a bygone era of high morals and values, it's more than just a violin, it's an instrument of history. Mr Aldridge set the bidding at \u00a350 for the violin, which was lot 230 of 251, so \"two of his friends could bid\" - but after just a couple of minutes it had passed \u00a3100,000. It eventually sold for \u00a3900,000 after fierce bidding between two telephone bidders. Hartley has become part of the ship's legend after leading his fellow musicians in playing as the vessel sank. They are famously said to have played the hymn Nearer My God To Thee. It had taken seven years for the Devizes auction house, Henry Aldridge & Son, to authenticate the instrument. Several experts were used, including forensic scientists who said the wood still contained salt deposits from the sea water. Some people still doubt whether the violin is the genuine article, however, and believe it could not have survived being submerged in the sea. But it is claimed the violin survived in a leather case strapped to Mr Harley's body who was found wearing his cork and linen lifejacket. A diary entry by his fiancee, Maria Robinson, said it was saved from the water and returned to her. Following her death in 1939, the violin was given to her local Salvation Army citadel and was later passed on to the current anonymous owner's mother in the early 1940s. The auction house said it had attracted interest from collectors all over the world and added that more than 315,000 people viewed it during a three-month exhibition in the United States. The most money previously paid for a piece of Titanic memorabilia is thought to have been a plan of the ship used in the 1912 inquiry into the sinking.

{"article": "Attorney General Jeremy Wright said it was a \"proper and well established\" principle that governments use the royal prerogative in such cases. But those bringing the case argue that it is vital MPs and peers get a say. Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which starts the Brexit process, is to be triggered by the end of next March. Campaigners say the prime minister lacks the power to do this without the prior authorisation of Parliament. But, arguing the government's case, Mr Wright said Article 50 was available to \"to give effect to the will of the people\", as expressed in June's referendum, in which a majority of voters backed Brexit. The use of the royal prerogative - powers historically held by the Crown but these days passed on to ministers - was \"wholly within the expectation of Parliament\", he said. Parliament had also passed an act allowing the referendum to take place, he added. The attorney general said the \"notification - once given - will not be withdrawn. It is our case that Parliament's consent is not required\". James Eadie QC, also representing the government, said the case had \"profound constitutional implications and profound political implications\". He added: \"It also raises a series of questions about how the British constitution should react in unique circumstances that concern the court and confront the country at this time.\" Mr Eadie said there was no written, constitutional formula and that the claimants in court wanted to use legal principles developed in different constitutional and legal circumstances to make them fit their argument - \"precisely denying the constitutional flexibility that lies at the heart of our constitution\". Mrs May announced at the Conservative Party conference that she intended giving an Article 50 notification by the end of March 2017 using the royal prerogative.

League gates have already dipped this season, with an average attendance more than 3,000 down on last season. Sky Blues fans are unhappy at the way their club is run by owners Sisu. Only one and a half stands were open at the 32,609-capacity stadium for the game against Crawley, with just 57 away fans making the trip. The crowd was lower even than the 1,603 who watched City's game against Carlisle United in February 2014, during their season at Sixfields, Northampton - the club's previous lowest ever 'home' crowd. Although attendance figures initially rose when City left Highfield Road for the Ricoh Arena in 2005, interest in the club has been decreasing steadily over the past decade, especially since relegation to League One in 2012. The Sky Blues are in their fifth campaign in the third tier of English football - and only once has their average seasonal attendance increased in that time - last term's relatively successful campaign, when they briefly led League One under Tony Mowbray before falling away to finish eighth. Under interim manager Mark Venus, they are currently in the relegation zone, in 21st place, after four straight league defeats. Relegation would take the club to their lowest place in the Football League since winning promotion from the old Division Four in 1959. City fans, who boycotted home games in the year at Northampton, have become increasingly dispirited this season. At the recent home fixture against MK Dons, they staged a mock funeral procession \"in affectionate remembrance of Coventry City Football Club which is dying due to neglect and abuse at the hands of Sisu from 2007 to 2016\". They also joined in with equally disaffected Charlton Athletic supporters in the joint 'pigs might fly' pitch protest in the away match at The Valley in October. Coventry have had some success in the Football League Trophy, reaching the two-leg Northern final in 2012-13, before going out in the Southern semis in 2014-15.

{"article": "Fairer outcomes remained an \"entrenched\" problem, she said, at an event promoting social mobility. Too many pupils fail to reach their potential, said Ms Greening. Making the most of all young people's talent was a \"hard, cold, economic imperative,\" she said. \"Children from high-income backgrounds who show signs of low academic ability at age five, are 35% more likely to become high earners than their poorer peers who show early signs of high ability,\" Ms Greening told a Social Mobility Commission event. Ms Greening said giving a fairer opportunity to all pupils remained a \"really hard long slog\". In her own family, she said she was the first to go to university. And the education secretary said that she had never planned to be a politician - and could remember her father shouting at out-of-touch politicians on the television. He was \"frustrated that he felt they didn't really talk about his life,\" she said. Ms Greening said that poorer pupils, despite any early signs of talent, were more likely to leave school without A-levels and miss out on the chance to go to university. Even among those who went to university, there were still inequalities. \"Graduates from disadvantaged backgrounds who do make it to the top jobs still earn, on average, over \u00c2\u00a32,200 a year less than their colleagues who happen to have been born to professional or managerial parents,\" she said. This was not just economic disadvantage, but also geographic, with some parts of England having much lower attainment, she said. A child living in one of the country's most disadvantaged areas was 27 times more likely to go to an inadequate school than a child in the most advantaged area, said Ms Greening. She said the government's \"opportunity areas\" would help to focus support in such deprived areas. And ensuring a supply of quality teachers could make a big difference to accelerating attainment. With the end of European Union membership, she said, it would become an economic necessity to make better use of all young people's abilities. Rather than employers \"scouring the world\" to find staff, she said, employers would need to focus more on making better use of home-grown talent. The UK had lower levels of productivity than many competitors, much of which was down to low levels of education, and that showed the importance of investing in education and training. But this week the education secretary faced strong criticism from the Public Accounts Committee, who warned the Department for Education had failed to engage with the seriousness of funding problems facing schools. MPs said ministers were failing to recognise the \"real-world consequences\" of their funding plans. The government has said that creating new grammar schools will promote social mobility. But Ms Greening said that any new grammars would also be accompanied by a \"new model\" for selection. \"We're talking about a new model of grammar schools and how selection can work,\" she said. \"It means an education system which caters for the very different talents and potential of different children - whether it's technical education, maths schools or whether it's giving local communities a choice over how selection works at local level. \"If we're really going to have things different - we have to be prepared to look at what that will take. \"Do we want to make sure though that new grammars will work effectively, collaboratively to lift attainment overall? Absolutely - that's precisely why there's so much work going on right now to make sure what we bring forward will be a new model of selection that works constructively to raise attainment.\"", "abstract": "Low-ability youngsters from wealthy families go on to earn more money than their more gifted, poorer counterparts, says the Education Secretary Justine Greening.", "candidate": "Education Secretary Justine Greening has called for a \"hard, cold, economic imperative\" to make better use of all young people's talents.", "doc_id": 3514, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Education Secretary Greening said there is a \"hard, cold, economic imperative\" to make better use of all young people's talents.", "evidence": "Making the most of all young people's talent was a \"hard, cold, economic imperative,\" she said.", "explanation": "The name Justine is not supported.

{"article": "The moneyed men were from the town's trawling fleets and made their living working \"at the hardest job in the world\". After about three weeks toiling in the fishing grounds, they would return for just three days on land to spend their hard-earned cash before going back to sea. Their lives and other aspects of the booming Grimsby fishing industry of the 1950s are being marked in an exhibition called Fish, Ships and Rock 'n' Roll. Local history enthusiast Alf Ludlam, 71, said: \"The men would stand out in what almost amounted to a uniform. \"They would wear pale grey or blue suits with lots of pleats in the back of the jackets and baggy trousers.\" Mr Ludlam, a museum volunteer with Grimsby Council, said the suits were a fashion statement but also a way of saying \"look at my money\" because the trawlermen could afford to buy a extravagant quantity of cloth. And the men wore open-necked shirts as \"however cold it was in town, it was never as cold as on a trawler off Iceland,\" he added . Mr Ludlam remembers watching the men roaming his home town during the 1950s, a time when \"thanks to fishing Grimsby was making more money than ever\". At its peak in that decade, Mr Ludlam said Grimsby was \"the largest fishing port in the world\". The vibrancy of the fishing trade had a spin-off for the rest of the town until the mid-1970s. It was a great period to grow up in Grimsby, Mr Ludlam said, because \"everything was in the melting pot\". \"Fishing was Grimsby's raison d'etre - no fishing, no Grimsby, \" he added. The heyday for the trade lasted about 20 years but the reliance on fishing proved to be a problem for the town as the trawler fleet contracted during, and after, the two decades of the Cod Wars. Iceland started extending its territorial limit around the island to exclude foreign vessels from the water it claimed as its own. The limit was extended on three occasions between 1958 and 1976, each time forcing British fishing vessels further offshore. The limit was finally extended 200 miles off Iceland. This led to confrontations at sea between the Icelandic coastguard and trawlers from Grimsby and Hull. Several ships were even rammed as trawlers continued to try to fish within the new limit. The neighbouring fishing ports of Grimsby and Hull vied with each other in the size and skill of their trawler fleet, and the quality and quantity of fish landed. Mr Ludlam said the ports had \"always been at daggers drawn\" and their fishing fleets were a source of civic pride. He said the collapse of the trawler industry in Grimsby mirrored the similar economic and social struggle former mining towns experienced after the pits closed. The two industries of fishing and mining were also linked by the level of danger encountered. Mr Ludlam said: \"Fishing was the most dangerous - when you set sail you didn't know if you were going to come back.\" The free exhibition Fish, Ships and Rock 'n' Roll is open until Sunday January 13 at the Fishing Heritage Centre in Grimsby .", "abstract": "It was easy to spot a so-called \"three-day millionaire\" in Grimsby in the 1950s.", "candidate": "In the 1950s, Grimsby's trawlermen wore suits almost as big as their boats.", "doc_id": 3549, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "In the 1950s, Grimsby's trawlermen wore suits that showcased their wealth.", "evidence": "Mr Ludlam, a museum volunteer with Grimsby Council, said the suits were a fashion statement but also a way of saying \"look at my money\" because the trawlermen could afford to buy a extravagant quantity of cloth.", "explanation": "\"as big as their boats\" was never stated and cannot be assumed.", "instruction": "Replace the information about almost as big as their boats with the information about to showcase their wealth.", "instruction_list": ["Replace the information about almost as big as their boats with the information about to showcase their wealth."]}}
{"article": "Ms Saunders will head the Crown Prosecution Service when Keir Starmer stands down in October. The career CPS lawyer has overseen some of the country's most important prosecutions and is currently the organisation's London chief. The DPP is the most senior criminal prosecutor in England and Wales, responsible for more than 6,800 staff. By Clive ColemanLegal correspondent, BBC News . The role of Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) is critical within the criminal justice system of England and Wales. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is the organisation that can deliver justice by making independent decisions as to whether there is sufficient evidence to charge a suspect, and when it decides that there is, by prosecuting the case effectively. It works closely with the police but must always be seen to make independent and dispassionate decisions based upon the evidence gathered. It can only prosecute when it concludes that there is sufficient evidence for there to be a realistic prospect of conviction, and that the prosecution is in the public interest. The DPP is the hands-on, day-to-day head of the CPS - which is currently negotiating a period of austerity and modernisation. Maintaining public confidence in it will be critical. The Attorney General, Dominic Grieve, said: \"Alison will make an excellent director of public prosecutions and is the right person to help the Crown Prosecution Service meet the challenges it will face in the coming years. \"I am particularly pleased that Alison is the first head of the CPS to be appointed from within its ranks as proof of the high quality of the professionals that work within the service. \"I'd also like to thank Keir Starmer for the great contribution he has made - not only to the CPS but more generally to the criminal justice system. He can be proud of the reforms that he and his staff have led to keep our criminal justice system one of the best in the world.\" Ms Saunders said: \"I am delighted and privileged to be appointed as the next director of public prosecutions. To lead an organisation of committed and professional staff is an honour, especially having worked for the CPS since its inception.\" Ms Saunders spent the early part of her career prosecuting in south London before working on CPS policy in relation to child victims and witnesses. In 2001 she became chief crown prosecutor for Sussex and oversaw the prosecution of Roy Whiting for the abduction and murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne. She then briefly left the CPS to join government as a deputy legal adviser to the attorney general. On her return, she set up the CPS organised crime division which deals with complex cases including human trafficking, drugs, counterfeiting and money laundering across borders. In 2009 Alison Sanders was named chief crown prosecutor for London, which deals with more than 200,000 cases a year. She oversaw the successful 2012 prosecution of two of the men who attacked and killed Stephen Lawrence in 1993.

{"article": "The firms' respective arrangements with Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg will be investigated. Announcing the move, tax commissioner Algirdas Semeta said that \"fair tax competition is essential\". Last year, a US Senate investigation accused Ireland of giving special tax treatment to Apple. The European Commission will look at whether the companies' tax affairs breach EU rules on state aid. Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said: \"In the current context of tight public budgets, it is particularly important that large multinationals pay their fair share of taxes.\" Countries in Europe cannot allow certain firms to pay less tax than they should, Mr Almunia added. The investigations will focus on \"transfer pricing\", or whether the countries allowed the multinational firms to charge one part of the company over the odds for goods or services from another part of the company as a way of shifting profits. Under Commission rules, companies must charge their subsidiaries market rates. Sanctions for a breach of tax rules could include an attempt to claw money back from Apple, Starbucks and Fiat. Apple said that it had not had \"any special tax deal with the Irish government\". \"We have received no selective treatment from Irish officials,\" the company said. \"Apple is subject to the same tax laws as scores of other international companies doing business in Ireland.\" The Irish finance ministry said Apple \"did not receive selective treatment and there was no 'special tax rate deal'\". \"Ireland is confident that there is no state aid rule breach in this case and we will defend all aspects vigorously,\" the Department of Finance said. Last year's US Senate committee investigation revealed that Apple had been able to funnel profits into Irish subsidiaries or \"ghost companies\" that had no declared tax residency anywhere in the world, cutting billions from its tax bill. The Senate committee hearing revealed that Apple designated its Irish entities as unlimited companies, which meant it did not have to publish annual accounts. The Irish arrangement allowed Apple to pay just 1.9% tax on its $37bn in overseas profits in 2012, despite the fact the average tax rate in the OECD countries that make up its main markets was 24% last year. In a 40-page memorandum, the Senate committee said: \"Ireland has essentially functioned as a tax haven for Apple.\" Coffee giant Starbucks has been embroiled in a tax controversy for a number of years. In 2012, the multinational admitted that it had a special tax deal with the Dutch government which allowed it to transfer money to its Dutch sister company in royalty payments. Starbucks said on Wednesday that its Dutch tax arrangements conformed with financial law. \"We comply with all relevant tax rules, laws and OECD guidelines and we're studying the Commission's announcement related to the state aid investigation in the Netherlands,\" a Starbucks spokesperson said. The Dutch finance ministry said it was confident that its tax system was \"robust\". \"We are confident that the investigation by the EC will in the end result in the conclusion there is no state aid involved,\" a spokesman told the BBC. The European Commission is also investigating the tax arrangements of Fiat's financial firm, Fiat Finance and Trade. Fiat said that while its financial arm is headquartered in Luxembourg, the investigation is into the government concerned. \"We are compliant with all Luxembourg regulations,\" the company added. Luxembourg has already riled the European Commission over the firm.

John Berry originally formed the Beastie Boys as a hardcore punk band with three friends in 1981 and came up with the name for the group. He played guitar on their first EP, Polly Wog Stew, but left before they achieved commercial success. Berry attended the Walden School in New York with fellow band member Mike Diamond, known as Mike D. The pair were later joined by Adam Yauch and Kate Schellenbach and released their debut EP in 1982. When Berry left the group, he was replaced by Adam Horovitz, known as Ad-Rock, and the band took a new direction as a rap group. Schellenback also left the group before the release of their 1986 album Licence To Ill, which debuted at number one in the US. The group became a huge commercial success, recording a total of eight studio albums over 25 years, which collectively sold more than 50 million copies worldwide. Four of them reached number one in the US, while their 1998 album Hello Nasty topped the album chart in the UK. Their best-known hits include (You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!), Intergalactic, and Ch-Check It Out. Seven of their albums achieved platinum sales status and the band toured with Madonna in 1985. Beastie Boys remained a three-piece until Adam Yauch's death from cancer in 2012. In the same year, Beastie Boys were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Billboard declared them the biggest selling rap group since the magazine began recording data in 1991. Horovitz read a speech written by Yauch at the ceremony, which mentioned Berry as a formative member of the band's early years. Frontal lobe dementia is a form of dementia that occurs when the frontal lobes of the brain begin to shrink. It is an uncommon form of dementia and is thought to affect about 16,000 people in the UK. Frontal lobe dementia is distinct from Alzheimer's disease and comes on earlier in life, usually between the ages of 45 and 65. Symptoms include problems with behaviour, language and thinking. The frontal lobes of the brain are involved in behaviour regulation. The disease can alter a person's character - they may become impulsive and lose their inhibitions or become less outgoing and socially isolated. Source: Alzheimer's Society and NHS Choices .

Senior Australian of the Year is 61-year-old Jackie French from New South Wales, a children's author and advocate for children with learning difficulties, and the Australian Local Hero is 41-year-old Juliette Wright from Queensland, who established an online platform to get goods and services to vulnerable and marginalised people. This year was the first time in the 55-year history of the awards that women have secured the top honour in all four categories. The recipients were great Australians and great role models, said chairman of the National Australia Day Council, Ben Roberts-Smith. \"It is a great moment in the 55-year history of these awards to honour four women. \"Rosie, Jackie, Drisana and Juliette remind us of the many ways in which women contribute to our nation; that women are a force for change, a voice for rights, influencers, educators and the heart of our communities,\" he said. After her son's death, UK-born Ms Batty emerged as an articulate and powerful advocate for the rights of women and children living in violent relationships, giving new force to efforts to prevent family violence across Australia. Family violence activists say Ms Batty's ability to explain to the public why so many women struggle to protect their children from violent partners helped make the issue of family violence a key campaign issue for all political parties in last November's Victoria state election. Greg Anderson, 54, killed Luke Batty in front of shocked onlookers at a cricket oval in Tyabb. The father and son had been playing together during an access visit in February 2014 when Anderson suddenly struck his son with a cricket bat and stabbed him. Anderson was shot by police after threatening them with a knife when they tried to detain him. He died later in hospital. Ms Batty was at the cricket ground when the attack happened. The public killing shocked Australians in a way that many other acts of family violence committed every week in the country have not.", "abstract": "A woman who became a campaigner against domestic violence after her son was killed by his father last February has been named Australian of the Year.", "candidate": "A woman who campaigned against family violence in Australia has been named the 2015 Australian of the Year.", "doc_id": 1471, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "A woman who campaigned against family violence in Australia has been named a 2015 Australian Day award winner.", "evidence": "After her son's death, UK-born Ms Batty emerged as an articulate and powerful advocate for the rights of women and children living in violent relationships, giving new force to efforts to prevent family violence across Australia.", "explanation": "The summary is incorrect because it has misinterpreted that the source has named the award.

{"article": "Willie Macleod, executive director of the British Hospitality Association, said many retailers \"relied on daily deliveries\" from Blochairn. Firefighters began tackling the blaze in the early hours of Thursday. Mr Macleod said suppliers at the market were sure to be \"resilient\" but that businesses would be impacted. City Property, which owns the site, said it was trying to establish alternative arrangements so that normal business could resume as soon as possible. Mr Macleod told the BBC: \"The impact on the market - short and medium-term - is not yet clear, it's unlikely that normal operations will be possible for the immediate or foreseeable future. \"Any disruption to supplies of fresh produce will have an impact on hospitality businesses and caterers, as well as retailers - many of whom rely on daily deliveries.\" Mr Macleod said that in the immediate term, menus were likely to be adjusted and, in some cases, fresh produce would be substituted by frozen items. He added: \"I'm sure that the wholesale suppliers which operate out of Blochairn will be resilient and adaptable and will already be looking at alternative arrangements for their customers - possibly using alternative markets such as Edinburgh or Newcastle in the interim. \"Hospitality businesses will look for alternative, short-term sources of supply where they can. \"Many larger chains and branded outlets operating in the west of Scotland will have national or regional procurement arrangements in place - these will not necessarily be reliant on Blochairn, so the impact in these cases is unlikely to be so severe.\" Donald Neilson, director of seafood company John Vallance, had been processing orders and loading vans when the fire broke out. \"It was a pretty quick evacuation and most of our stock was left lying,\" he said. \"We supply from the market to other wholesalers, restaurants, hotels, fish and chip shops and places like that. \"The west of Scotland and central Scotland - all the restaurants and hotels - will have to go without orders today.\" Mr Neilson said he was hopeful the fire had been stopped before it got the the fish market area. \"Hopefully we'll get back into the markets as soon as possible because all our computers and office stuff is there. \"We also want to check our chills, our freezers and our tanks are ok.\" In the meantime, he said they had secured temporary warehouse space and hoped to provide a service from there. Jim McGhee, who owns Castle Douglas fruit and veg shop Mitchell's, was also there when the fire broke out. \"We have a wholesale fruit business with a retail outlet and we go to the market two to three times a week,\" he said. \"I had just got my lorry loaded up luckily - there were a couple of things I didn't get because the police asked us all to leave the area. \"There is a bit of the market that hasn't been touched by the fire so I would think we will still be OK next week to get stuff. \"The top end of the market has escaped the fire it is just the bottom end.\" He said a couple of the fruit and vegetable businesses been affected, and the flower market had been burned. \"I managed to get a load this morning, I was up there quite early and I was just about fully loaded when the fire broke out, so I am OK for today and the weekend,\" he added. \"We are a wee bit worried about Monday but hopefully there should be enough businesses open to get us what we need.\"", "abstract": "A huge fire at a Glasgow fruit and vegetable market will hit local restaurants, flower shops and cafes, an industry chief has predicted.", "candidate": "Restaurants and hotels could be hit by the loss of fresh produce supplies following a fire at a fish market in Dumfries and Galloway.", "doc_id": 1897, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Restaurants and hotels could be hit by the loss of fresh produce supplies following a fire at a fish market.", "evidence": "\"Any disruption to supplies of fresh produce will have an impact on hospitality businesses and caterers, as well as retailers - many of whom rely on daily deliveries.\"", "explanation": "The summary gives the location of the fish market as Dumfries and Galloway and that location was not referenced in the source text.", "instruction": "Remove the information about specific location of the fish market from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about specific location of the fish market from the summary."]}}

{"article": "Taking comfort from the fact that, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit, the UK leads the world for care of people in the final weeks of their life is perhaps a more appropriate reaction. The UK topped the table when the EIU last carried out this exercise in 2010. But the number of countries included has been doubled to 80 in this latest survey, commissioned by the Lien Foundation of Singapore. So for the UK to again lead the pack, including all other wealthy nations, is significant. In essence, the UK scores so highly for the care of patients nearing the end of their life because the NHS is such a well-integrated service. Health professionals, ranging from hospital doctors to GPs and community nurses, generally work together effectively to ensure patients receive the end of life care they might expect. This includes pain management through palliative care. This is not the case in many international healthcare systems. The report praises the UK for having a comprehensive strategy with the NHS working alongside the hospice movement and charities such as Marie Curie and Macmillan. Ensuring that people get to live out their final days in a place of their choice is an area where there has been progress in recent years. Its interesting that both the report authors and other experts in the field have gone out of their way to stress there is still plenty of scope to do better. The Health Ombudsman in England recently highlighted cases where people were badly let down and experienced death without dignity. Future demand, the report says, is likely to be higher as people live longer and the burden of cancer, dementia and diabetes increases. While noting the report's findings are \"very encouraging\", the Health Minister Ben Gummer said the Government was determined to go even further to ensure patients and families were involved in decisions about care. The crossbench peer Baroness Finlay has introduced a Palliative Care Bill which will be debated in Parliament this month. The aim she says is to guarantee all patients equal access to services around the clock and regardless of geography. But she acknowledges that, helped by each of the UK's health administrations having a strategy, there has been improvement. \"We are vastly better than we were - patients are rating good services very highly though the problem is gaps in provision at ground level,\" she says. The hospice movement, she told the Today programme is \"setting a gold standard and leading the world\". Its important to give praise where praise is due. In this sensitive area, its easy to assume from anecdotal reports that the NHS could do a lot better. So to score more highly than Australia and New Zealand, as well as Germany, France and the US is highly commendable. Richer nations inevitably lead the pack with the Philippines, Bangladesh and Iraq propping up the table. Affordability of care, with a taxpayer funded health service, is predictably a lot more bearable for British patients than in other economies. The NHS, the hospices and a range of dedicated professionals should be given a pat on the back. Specialist training and expertise is highlighted by the report, along with successful national policies. We can be reassured that the quality of death in the UK is as high as we might feel it ought to be in a civilised society.", "abstract": "Celebration is probably the wrong word even though the UK tops an important international league table for one aspect of health care.", "candidate": "It is easy to assume from anecdotal reports that the NHS could do a lot better.", "doc_id": 2624, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "Its important to give praise where praise is due.

{"article": "In a video released hours ahead of his official launch in Miami, the 62-year-old brother of ex-president George W Bush declared: \"I'm ready to lead.\" He also promised to protect the country's most vulnerable and remove the barriers to social mobility. But doubts persist among conservatives in his party. And early polling suggests that he has yet to dominate a wide field of Republican candidates. In his latest video, entitled The Greatest Century, he strikes a very optimistic note, saying: \"I see a great country on the verge of its greatest century, and I'm ready to lead.\" The Bush team may have hoped their man would have built a clear lead in the polls by now, but the consensus view is he's currently just one in a pack of frontrunners. Recent interviews with campaign strategists indicate that they are going to start using the millions of dollars at their disposal to target opponents they consider most threatening - namely, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and Florida Senator Marco Rubio. In his opening campaign video, Mr Bush emphasised his positive, optimistic vision for the future, saying some politicians \"talk about problems; I see solutions\". But in the coming months, the fight for the Republican presidential nomination could get nasty. Although his campaign becomes official on Monday, it's been no secret for many months and his team is well on the way to raising a $100m war chest. During a tour of Europe last week, Mr Bush warned he would not waver from his core beliefs, even if some are unpopular in his party. \"I'm not going to change who I am,\" he said. \"I respect people who may not agree with me, but I'm not going to change my views because today someone has a view that's different.\" In a separate video, called Making A Difference, he champions the rights of women, ethnic minorities and the disabled. \"My core beliefs start with the premise that the most vulnerable in our society should be in the front of the line and not the back,'' he says. \"What we need is new leadership that takes conservative principles and applies them so that people can rise up.\" Profile: Jeb Bush . A Spanish language video was also released, demonstrating his strong Hispanic links - his wife Columba is Mexican and he speaks Spanish well. But in recent weeks he has found himself on the defensive over the Iraq War - led by his older brother, President George W Bush - as he stumbled to clarify his position. The issue brought into focus the problems he may face over his famous surname and the baggage that comes with it. He becomes the 11th Republican to declare, with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and Florida Senator Marco Rubio among his biggest rivals. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton is the clear frontrunner. This raises the possibility in 2016 of another Clinton-Bush race like that of 1992, when Mrs Clinton's husband Bill beat Jeb Bush's father, President George HW Bush.

More than 11 million others have been forced from their homes. \"Syria is ready to participate in the Syrian-Syrian Dialogue in Geneva without any foreign interference,\" Mr Muallem told reporters in Beijing on Thursday following a meeting with his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi. \"We hope that this dialogue will be successful to help us in having a national unity government,\" he added. Mr Wang said the Chinese and Syrian governments had agreed on three principles that \"should be upheld throughout the whole peace process\". \"We should stick to the peaceful resolution of Syrian issue, the people of Syria should decide the future and fate of Syria, and the UN plays a key role in negotiations,\" he added. On Friday, the UN Security Council unanimously backed a resolution endorsing a road map for the peace process, including negotiations, a ceasefire and elections. But the resolution avoided contentious issues, including who could represent the opposition at the peace talks and the fate of Mr Assad. Mr Wang declined to answer directly when asked if Mr Assad should remain in power. \"China's position is very clear. We believe Syria's future, its national system, including its leadership, should be decided and set by the people of Syria.\" The United States, which supports the Syrian opposition, wants a negotiated settlement based on the 2012 Geneva Communique, which calls for the formation of a transitional governing body. It says President Bashar al-Assad must go. Russia, which launched an air campaign against Mr Assad's opponents in September, also calls for the implementation of the Geneva Communique. But it says Mr Assad's future is for the Syrian people, not external powers, to decide. Most of Syria's political and armed opposition factions now agree on the need for a managed transition but they demand that the president leave at the start of it. Bashar al-Assad says peace talks cannot begin until \"terrorism\" is eliminated and that his departure is out of the question before elections are held. On Tuesday, the head of the UN's Geneva office said special envoy Staffan de Mistura expected to convene the talks \"some time towards the end of January\". \"Almost everybody wants these talks to be successful, so that we can finally get a political solution to this really unacceptable problem,\" Michael Moller said.

{"article": "In the ruined village of Arquata del Tronto, a group of bloggers has gone in search of its destroyed history, posting findings on a Facebook page called Chiedi alla polvere (Ask The Dust). \"Ask the dust\" is an old saying that usually refers to something unknowable. But here, some young residents want to give the dust a voice. Time in the hilltop village of Arquata del Tronto did not just stop during the quake, which struck in the night at 03:36 (01:36 GMT), it disintegrated: the shock wrenched the minute hand from the village clock. Visits to the no-go \"red zones\" are brief and hazardous, and firefighters bark you back on to the road if you start down an alley or peer too closely into a ruined house. But the dust stays with you. A fine white coating that clings to your boots. From a tent in an aid camp in Arquata's lower village, the bloggers post old photos of the village and its surroundings, stories and reflections, news about the relief effort, blogging in Italian and English. One entry shows a child's drawing of an idyllic little house with a horse and a hen - next to a photo of a ruin. \"I thought I was at my house,\" it begins. \"There where nothing bad that could happen. My refuge, my every day, my bed, my beloved couch where I spent entire afternoons in winter watching movies.\" \"Unfortunately,\" the post ends, it became \"that part of TV that every time I hate to see\" - the TV news. \"My couch is gone.\" When Gaia Paolini, 18, comes home from her school in Ascoli Piceno she spends time with her childhood friends curating the blog. She is one of the lucky ones whose home survived the quake. \"We put our emotions, all our story, the story of the village, into the page,\" she says. \"We are trying to preserve the memory of this place and also trying to preserve its future after the construction of new buildings that we hope can be made soon.\" The blog records the support that the village has received, from the aid effort co-ordinated by the government to the concerts played by visiting musicians in the canteen tent, which is also used for church services. \"We have so much help from local people and people all over Italy and it is so beautiful,\" Gaia says. Another website translates a poem from before the quake about Pescara del Tronto, a hamlet near Arquata that suffered even greater damage: 48 people died there, including 12 tourists. \"Pescara sweet notes . Of water, . Pescara of rocks and labours . Stories of fathers . Ancient Tales, . Pescara of houses . Cling to each other . Like sisters or friends. Pescara perfume . From childhood and memories . Walls of stone . Warm sunsets.\" The poem, written by someone called Eidi, comes from Pescara's website, which has become a virtual time capsule for the pre-quake days when holidaymakers headed there for the mountain air and tranquillity. One day the tourists will return to the Tronto Valley and its ruined villages will be rebuilt.

There is already a languages skills shortage but currently the UK can rely on other EU nationals \"to plug the gap\", say the group. Ministers say their reforms are already boosting language learning in schools. Launching a checklist on Brexit and languages, the group say lack of language ability loses the UK an estimated 3.5% of economic performance. The country currently relies on the EU to negotiate trade deals but this will no longer be possible once the UK has left the Union, they add. APPG co-chair Baroness Coussins said: \"Brexit must make the UK's language skills a top policy issue. \"Language skills are vital for our exports, education, public services and diplomacy.\" Baroness Coussins called for \"a national plan to ensure the UK produces the linguists we need to become a world leader in global free trade and on the international stage.\" The group identify a need to boost skills in both European and non-European languages for the purposes of trade, international relations and security. In particular, they fear the loss of European language skills if EU nationals already living in the UK are not guaranteed residency status post Brexit. They also want the UK to continue full participation in the Erasmus+ scheme, where young people study, work volunteer and train abroad in Europe, some working as language assistants in schools.

The national situation is parlous,\" said Mr Buchanan. Sara Davidson, head of modern languages at the private Oundle School and chairwoman of the Independent Schools Modern Languages Association, said she did not know of a language department that did not employ native speakers. \"Native speakers are helping us out amidst a major recruitment crisis in modern language teaching. \"We simply do not currently produce enough linguists in this country to fill the modern language teaching vacancies we have.\" Ruth Sinclair-Jones, UK director of Erasmus+, said the value of the scheme to the UK \"cannot be underestimated\". \"Losing UK participation would limit the future prospects of young people and the country as a whole,\" she said.

{"article": "The total population is now estimated to be less than 500 breeding pairs. The situation is even worse south of the border where the iconic bird of prey is said to be heading to the brink of extinction. The latest survey found 460 breeding pairs in Scotland in 2016 compared with more than 500 when the previous study was carried out six years earlier. The RSPB, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and the Scottish Raptor Study Group, along with a range of other UK partners carried out the survey. It found Scotland remained a major stronghold for hen harriers, with 80% of the UK population. However, having a breeding population of fewer than 1,000 birds makes the species vulnerable to the effects of habitat degradation and, in some areas, wildlife crime. The west Highlands continue to provide a home for the majority of Scotland's breeding harriers, while Orkney and the Hebrides were the only areas of the country to show a slight increase in the number of the birds. A major project aimed at maintaining their population has also been carried out at Langholm Moor in Dumfries and Galloway. Duncan Orr-Ewing, head of species and land management at RSPB Scotland, said: \"The hen harrier is an indicator of the health of our upland environment, and the fact that its population continues to decline is of major concern. \"The hen harrier is a high priority for our conservation work and urgent steps need to be taken to tackle illegal killing of this species and to improve their moorland breeding habitats.\" Eileen Stuart, SNH's head of policy and advice, said the decline was a \"serious concern\". She said they were committed to working with others to tackle wildlife crime throughout the country. \"There is a very concerning trend of a long term decline in the number of breeding hen harriers in Scotland,\" added Wendy Mattingley of the Scottish Raptor Study Group. \"For the population to begin to recover and expand over all suitable habitat, the intensively managed grouse moors of east and south Scotland must produce successful breeding hen harriers again. \"The hen harrier is a wonderful spectacular raptor and more action must be taken to ensure that its future is secure.\" Tim Baynes, director of the Scottish Moorland Group, said the decline was disappointing but said it would be working to better understand the reasons behind poor breeding and help to rebuild the harrier population. Simon Wotton, lead author of the study, described the survey as a \"monumental effort\". \"We hope these results will convince everyone in a position to help hen harriers to take positive steps to ensure their protection and rebuild the country's population for people to enjoy for generations to come,\" he said.", "abstract": "Hen harrier numbers have fallen by 9% in Scotland since 2010, according to the latest national survey.", "candidate": "Scotland's hen harrier population has continued to decline, according to a new survey.", "doc_id": 3521, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "\"There is a very concerning trend of a long term decline in the number of breeding hen harriers in Scotland,\"", "explanation": "Very accurate to the source.

A teenage boy managed to bring Mr Bradley ashore at about 17:00 BST on Monday where attempts were made to resuscitate him. Emergency services took him to Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry, about four miles away, where it was announced that he had died. Ulster Unionist MLA Danny Kennedy said the death was devastating news for the man's family and the village of Bessbrook. \"This is a very tragic outcome to controversies surrounding flags in this village,\" Mr Kennedy said. \"This is too high a price for any family and community to pay. \"The entire Bessbrook community will join with me in showing our sympathy and support for the whole family circle. \"He was highly respected and liked within the Bessbrook community. I counted him as a personal friend and I am deeply upset by his untimely and tragic death.\" Dominic Bradley of the nationalist SDLP, who knows Bradley family, said the village was in shock. \"I think the action that he undertook yesterday was probably uncharacteristic of him, from what I hear from friends of his,\" said the assembly member. \"Bessbrook is a mixed community, Catholics and Protestants live side-by-side and, generally speaking down through the years, community relations have been very good. \"I believe some local councillors and the police have arranged for the flags to be removed.\" Mr Bradley was a member of the County Armagh victims' group Families Acting for Innocent Relatives (FAIR).

In early February, a frustrated Oliseh posted an eight-minute video rant on his own website to hit back at what he called the \"insanity\" of his critics. He had come under pressure after Nigeria failed to get past the group stages of the 2016 African Nations Championship (CHAN) in Rwanda. The coach later apologised to the NFF for his outburst aimed at the Nigerian media as well as some of his former international team-mates. Oliseh had also gone public with the money problems affecting his team during the continental tournament in Rwanda, to the embarrassment of his employers.

{"article": "It follows the revelation that the Church of England has dropped its opposition to gay clergy becoming bishops if they agree to stay celibate. The Reverend Martin Reynolds says his friend Jeffrey John, the Dean of St Albans, has been made a \"whipping boy\" in the row. He told Radio Wales it would be great if he could now become a Welsh bishop. Dr John, from Tonyrefail in Rhondda Cynon Taf, has been at the centre of the row over gay bishops having twice been put forward for the role in the Church of England. In 2003 he declined the position of Bishop of Reading in the face of protests from traditionalists. He was also rejected as a candidate for the Bishop of Southwark in 2010, with evidence emerging it was because of his sexual orientation. On Friday, however, it was revealed that after a decision taken last month the Church of England would allow gay men in civil partnerships to become bishops as long as they promise to be celibate. Unlike the Church of England, the Church in Wales has never had a ban on gay clergy in civil partnerships becoming bishops. Mr Reynolds, an Anglican priest in Newport, claimed the reason the moratorium in the Church of England was introduced 18 months ago was because Dr John was about to become Bishop of Southwark. He told BBC Radio Wales: \"Rowan [Williams, the former Archbishop of Canterbury] didn't want another furore ... they shafted Jeffrey yet again - introduced this rule that you couldn't be in a civil partnership which of course Jeffrey is with Grant [Holmes, a hospital chaplain]. \"Poor old Jeffrey's been more than just a whipping boy - he's been assassinated really several times.\" Asked if there was now any realistic chance of his friend becoming a bishop in the Church in England, Mr Reynolds said: \"Wouldn't it be nice if he became a bishop in the Church in Wales?\" He added that gay clergy in civil partnerships in Wales are not asked \"if we do anything naughty in bed\". Asked about the question of policing the celibacy of gay clerics, Mr Reynolds said he believed honour still exists in the church. \"When Jeffrey said he and Grant weren't actually sleeping together anymore I think we all believed him. \"I don't think there was a single person ... that I ever spoke to said Jeffrey wasn't telling the truth.\" Mr Reynolds also praised the Church in Wales approach on the celibacy issue. \"In Wales we've never bothered, we've never tried,\" he said. \"Our bishop has never introduced any such a role and, of course, we know that the archbishop of Wales has said if there was a gay man who was in a relationship who was nominated, he'd be happy to ordain him.\"", "abstract": "A gay rights campaigning clergyman has called for a leading Welsh gay cleric to be made a bishop in Wales.", "candidate": "A gay clergyman has been \"assassinated\" in the row over gay bishops, his friend has claimed.", "doc_id": 2885, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "\"Poor old Jeffrey's been more than just a whipping boy - he's been assassinated really several times", "explanation": "Directly mentioned being assassinated but in this case it means his character was attacked, not literally assassinated.

But the students demanded the university paid back the \u00a3300,000 it had accepted of a \u00a31.5m grant from a charity wing of the regime. The grant was pledged in 2009 by the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation. The funds have so far been used to develop a research programme on North Africa, focused on politics, economics and society. The student demonstrators called on the LSE management to \"repay\" the \u00a3300,000 already spent by creating a scholarship fund for underprivileged Libyan students. The students also urged the university to revoke the LSE alumni status of Libyan leader Col Gaddafi's second son Saif al-Islam, who studied at the university from 2003 to 2008, gaining both a Master of Science degree and a doctorate. They called for a public commitment that no grants from officials \"of such oppressive regimes\" would be accepted in the future, as well as a public statement denouncing the recent \"gross violations of human rights\" by the Gaddafi regime. One of the protesters, Ashok Kumar, who is also education officer for the LSE students' union, said: \"I think it's reprehensible that the university continues to benefit from money that was stolen from the Libyan people and it's only right to return it to the people who are now being murdered in the streets fighting for their freedom.\" The money should be returned either as scholarships to underprivileged students, or \"to the families of those who have been murdered and who continue to be murdered\", he said. In a statement, the university said the LSE Director \"noted the message\" from the students. \"He shares the students' revulsion at the recent violence and gross violations of human rights in Libya, and much regrets the association of the School's name with Saif Gaddafi and the actions of the Libyan regime. \"The School's statement of 21 February made clear that School engagement with the present Libyan authorities, covering a number of programmes, has already finished or has been stopped following the events of the weekend of 19-20 February.\" The university said no more of the \u00a31.5m donation from the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation would be accepted.

{"article": "The UN Office on Drugs and Crime said land used for opium had risen by 17% this year, from nearly 40,000 hectares (100,000 acres) to 51,000 hectares. Burma is the second largest opium grower in the world after Afghanistan. Almost all of the opium it produces is grown in Shan and Kachin states, which have seen longstanding conflict between the military and ethnic rebel groups. Citing figures from the Burmese government, the report said almost 24,000 hectares of poppy fields had been eradicated in 2012 - about four times the figure in 2011. Gary Lewis, UNODC representative in South East Asia, said the situation on the ground was \"very complex\". In areas where opium was grown, there was ''a toxic combination of guns, money and drugs'', he said. The army and rebel fighters often profit from allowing the trade to continue. Farmers, meanwhile, say the instability means they have little choice but to continue growing the lucrative poppy plant - which is used to make heroin. Burma accounts for 25% of opium grown in the world, while Laos accounts for 3%, said the report, entitled the South East Asia Opium Survey 2012. In Laos, land used to grow opium increased almost four-fold between 2007 and 2012 to 6,300 hectares. The recent rise contrasts with the situation from 1998 to 2006, when both Burma and Laos saw big drops - with an 83% reduction in the case of Burma. Most of Burma's opium is refined into heroin - about half goes to meet the growing market in China, with the rest being sold across South East Asia. Part of the reason for the sustained growth in the cultivation of this crop is the demand for heroin in Asia, said the report. But the good news, in the case of Burma, was that there was now ''momentum to find the solution'', Mr Lewis said. There is support from President Thein Sein's government, which has embarked on a series of reforms. Ceasefires and political opening up also meant that international organisations such as the UN now have better access to the areas.

The company added that a similar pay commitment is being made to staff in the Republic of Ireland. Susan Fitzgerald, a regional officer with the Unite union, welcomed the company's decision. \"This is a very significant victory for Lidl workers, our members and Unite, who led the campaign to demand equal pay for workers in Northern Ireland,\" she said. \"We are particularly pleased that Lidl's adoption of the living wage will extend to their workforce in the Republic of Ireland. \"This announcement means other retail chains are now on notice that they need to pay the living wage - there can be no justification for poverty-pay.\" Earlier this year, the government announced there would be a new, compulsory National Living Wage of \u00a37.20 an hour from April 2016.

{"article": "The 111 service, replacing NHS Direct, is due to launch in England on Monday. The British Medical Association's letter to Sir David Nicholson follows reported problems in trial areas. Health Minister Lord Howe has said some areas will have more time to go live with 111 while \"thorough testing\" to ensure reliability is carried out. Lord Howe has already admitted the new 111 telephone advice service - which the government has said will ease pressure on emergency 999 phone lines - had run into \"teething problems\". But the BMA said that in several areas it seemed to have been completely unable to cope with call volumes or suffered severe IT failures. It said patient safety was being put at risk. Dr Laurence Buckman, chairman of the the BMA's GP committee, said: \"There have been widespread reports of patients being unable to get through to an operator or waiting hours before getting a call back with the health information they have requested, . \"In some areas, such as Greater Manchester, NHS 111 effectively crashed because it was unable to cope with the number of calls it was receiving. The quality of advice being given out has also been questionable in some instances.\" He said the \"chaotic mess\" of 111 was \"placing strain\" on overstretched parts of the NHS, such as the ambulance service, and potentially placing patients at risk. \"The BMA has been warning the government about the problems with NHS 111 for almost two years. They must finally act to ensure that patient safety is guaranteed,\" he added. The BMA said it had written to NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson to call for a delay to the launch of 111 until it was \"fully safe for the public\". Dr Buckman said: \"We cannot sacrifice patient safety in order to meet a political deadline for the launch of a service that doesn't work properly.\" The Department of Health has already sanctioned an extension of up to six months of the original 1 April 2013 deadline for regions struggling to set up the new service. The NHS Direct 0845 4647 service will continue to be available to callers in areas where the NHS 111 service is not yet available, Lord Howe has said.

{"article": "Wales led after an hour of the first Test before losing 39-21, and succumbed 36-22 in the second after being level 10-10 at the break. That extended New Zealand's winning run against Wales to 28 games since 1953. \"We just switch off for five-10 minutes and before you know it, New Zealand have pulled away,\" said Williams. \"But there are encouraging signs that we are playing a more expansive game.\" Wales' efforts have had the former Cardiff Blues and Pontypridd player \"on the edge of his seat\". But the former Wales captain and British and Irish Lions tourist has been disappointed that his country have not been able to beat an All Blacks team in transition following high-profile retirements. After the 2015 World Cup, the All Blacks lost record-breaking flanker and captain Richie McCaw, fly-half Dan Carter and midfield pair Ma'a Nonu and Conrad Smith. \"There are two schools of thought at the moment in Wales,\" said Williams. \"One, 'yes we've gone toe-to-toe with the All Blacks and played some great rugby'. \"And the other one is, 'well we've failed again' because they are a team in transition. I don't care how good the players are \u2026 I'm a little bit disappointed. \"Whenever you take 700 caps of experience out of a squad, it's got to leave a dent and traditionally they are slow in June. \"On the flip side, you look at our squad - it was the most experienced that's ever left these shores. We didn't have injury worries so I thought this was our opportunity.\" The All Blacks have made five starting changes for the third Test, with coach Steve Hansen hoping the risk will have its rewards. Flanker Elliott Dixon makes his debut at blind-side flanker in place of Jerome Kaino, while George Moala takes over at centre from injured Malakai Fekitoa. Fly-half Beauden Barrett makes only his eighth All Blacks start in 38 appearances as he takes over from Aaron Cruden, who was injured in the second Test. Barrett has scored 26 points, including three tries in four appearances against Wales. Two of those tries came in a 15-point haul as New Zealand beat Wales 34-16 in Cardiff in 2014 in his previous start against Warren Gatland's side. Barrett crossed for his third try against Wales in Wellington last weekend. Charlie Faumuina takes over from Owen Franks at prop and Julian Savea returns on the wing in place of Waisake Naholo, who drops to the bench. Injury has forced out veteran Wales prop Gethin Jenkins as well as lock Bradley Davies. Rob Evans is back at loose-head prop, while Gatland brings in Tomas Francis at tight-head as Samson Lee is relegated to replacement duty. Gatland, a leading candidate to return to New Zealand as British and Irish Lions coach in 2017, wants his team to stop 'shooting themselves in the foot'. If so, Williams, who was coached by Gatland and Hansen in a 100-cap Wales career says the Dunedin encounter \"could well be\" the one in which his countrymen end 63 years of hurt.

{"article": "A letter to Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford warns they may be forced to cut frontline police budgets or lower training standards below England's. They are particularly concerned that the \u00a32m they pay in the apprenticeship levy is not spent on police training. The Welsh Government said the levy does not cover Treasury funding cuts. North Wales commissioner Arfon Jones, who chairs the All-Wales Policing Group, said in the letter that Welsh forces were \"now at a serious financial disadvantage and in future will be disadvantaged in terms of training compared to our English counterparts\". He warned that Wales faced a bill of \u00a38.9m for the Police Education Qualifications Framework (PEQF) by 2020-21. While English forces only had to meet 8% of training costs with the rest covered by the apprenticeship levy, Mr Jones said forces in Wales faced paying 95% to 100% from their own budgets. A shortfall of \u00a310m would be equivalent to 200 fewer officers in Wales, he added. Welsh forces had already lost 2,500 police officers and staff since 2010, Mr Jones said, \"equivalent to the entire resources of North Wales Police\". \"Under such pressures, Welsh forces might have to lower the standard of training and it would be regrettable to break away from the uniform standards that are currently in place,\" Mr Jones said. \"Being forced to fund the training from existing resources would inevitably have an impact on frontline policing.\" A Welsh Government spokeswoman said ministers had written to Home Secretary Amber Rudd about the issue of police training. \"While we are supportive of the PEGF in principle, we have been clear that responsibility for operational policing matters, including training, rests solely with the Home Office and it should fund training until policing is devolved,\" she said. As for the apprenticeship levy - 0.5% payable on annual wage bills of more than \u00a33m - the spokeswoman said it was a UK government employment tax \"which directly conflicts with areas of devolved responsibility\". As skills policy is devolved, the money is not necessarily spent on apprenticeships in Wales. Instead, the Welsh Government is entitled to a population-based share of the proceeds under the UK Treasury's Barnett formula, to be spent as ministers in Cardiff see fit. The spokeswoman said such money had been \"largely offset by cuts made elsewhere, meaning there is no significant new money to invest in services as a result of the apprenticeship levy\". A Home Office spokesman said: \"All police forces pay the apprenticeship levy, and in Wales those funds are passed back to the Welsh Government through an arrangement agreed with HM Treasury.\"", "abstract": "Wales could have 200 fewer police officers than it should by 2021 due to a shortfall of up to \u00a310m in training cash, police chiefs have claimed.", "candidate": "Police forces in Wales have warned they face a \u00a310m funding gap over the next five years.", "doc_id": 1393, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Police forces in Wales have warned that a \u00a310m funding gap would mean 200 fewer officers.", "evidence": "A shortfall of \u00a310m would be equivalent to 200 fewer officers in Wales, he added.", "explanation": "The text does not show police forces clearly warning that they face a \u00a310m funding gap and the timeframe of the next five years is not supported.", "instruction": "Replace the information about they face a \u00a310m funding gap over the next five years with the information about a \u00a310m funding gap would mean 200 fewer officers.", "instruction_list": ["Replace the information about they face a \u00a310m funding gap over the next five years with the information about a \u00a310m funding gap would mean 200 fewer officers."]}}

{"article": "Mohammed Allan, an alleged activist for the Islamic Jihad militant group, was on a respirator and was being given fluids, an Israeli hospital said. His case is being seen as a test of a recent Israeli law authorising the force-feeding of hunger strikers. Israeli doctors are challenging the law, which they say is unethical. The Israeli Medical Association has described force-feeding as tantamount to torture and a violation of a patient's rights. It has urged doctors to refuse orders to perform the procedure. Supporters of the law say force-feeding is necessary to save prisoners from death, and to discourage them from using hunger strikes as a tactic to end - or draw attention - to their detention. It is not yet known if Mr Allan will be subjected to the controversial procedure, in which doctors forcibly insert a tube into the empty stomach. The decision could depend on his medical condition. A statement from the Barzilai hospital, where Mr Allan is being treated, said his condition had deteriorated on Friday morning but remained stable. \"The treatment is being administered according the ethics committee guidelines and includes respiration and intravenous fluids and saline,\" a hospital statement said. Jamil al-Khatib, a lawyer for Mr Allan, told the AFP news agency that he had heard his client had gone into a coma and that Israeli authorities were planning to force-feed him.

{"article": "The system for handling patient calls has been beset with problems and last month it was temporarily withdrawn. But a 2013 internal review described it as a \"particularly strong exemplar of good practice\". The Scottish government said the review was held before a significant testing phase of the project had taken place. The project is more than two years behind schedule. It is also currently running 55% over budget with an estimated cost of \u00a3117.4m, \u00a341.6m higher than planned. NHS 24 has already borrowed \u00a320m from the Scottish government in order to cover the escalating costs. Since the August 2013 Programme and Project Management Centre of Expertise review it has emerged that nobody read through the contract before it was put out to tender. This meant that vital performance measures were left out. On 2 December, MSPs on the Scottish Parliament's Public Audit Committee gasped as they were told that \"human error\" was to blame for a poorly worded contract. Key parts were not copied over to the final version, which meant that contractors were not obliged to meet important performance measures. Committee members described the mistakes as \"incredible\". The following week the Scottish government's most senior policy advisor, Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans, told the Public Audit Committee: \"I would expect team in charge to be clear about what they were signing up to and that the document was fit for purpose.\" Committee convener Paul Martin MSP put it to Mrs Evans that he had signed loan agreements for much less than \u00a375m and they always contained the phrase \"please read carefully\". Mrs Evans said: \"Common sense, apart from anything else, would emphasise the importance of reading the document that one signs.\" It has now emerged that the project was recommended in an internal report as something which could be \"transferable to other programmes\".

That's what the best players do; they make you play those extra balls. I like those moments, they help me focus better.

It was similar at the end of the first set on Monday against Nick Kyrgios. He played a couple of great points on the first two set points but then on the third one I managed to just nick it. I got enough balls back in play to get it done. When nothing's really going on in the match, like in the middle of the second set against Nick, it's much harder to concentrate than at 6-5, 0-30. You're aware of the importance of the points, so your mind is right there in the moment. It can be easy to rush or go for a shot that's not there when opportunities come and go so fast, and you need to make sure you can control your mind. Not everyone is able to do that, but the more you experience those situations, the more you're able to calm yourself.

I drive myself to and from the club and on the journey home my thoughts turned straight to playing Tsonga - the Kyrgios match just isn't relevant at that moment. When a tournament is finished I'll reflect on it as a whole and speak with my team. Right now, in the middle of the tournament, they'll say 'you did this well' or 'you did that well' or 'this could be better'. Then it's about concentrating on the next one and what we're going to do.

{"article": "The share price fall extended a decline that started almost immediately after Snapchat started trading on the stock market this spring. The firm reported 173 million daily users, up 4% on the prior quarter. But the company is struggling with fierce competition from Facebook, which offers similar features. Snap's stock, which was priced at $17 for its public offering in March, is now trading at less than $14. On Thursday, chief executive Evan Spiegel pledged that he and fellow co-founder Robert Murphy would not sell any of their own shares this year, as a sign of confidence in the firm's prospects. The shares were worth billions at the time of the IPO. \"We believe deeply in the long-term success of Snap,\" he told analysts on a call after the results were released. Snap made its name as a messaging app, with texts that would disappear. It now offers video stories, maps and other features. The firm said it is working to woo advertisers with low prices and evidence that its ads are working - features it hopes will set it apart from rivals. Revenue over the three months to the end of June was $181.7m, more than double the same period in 2016. But expenses grew even faster, reaching more than $630.6m for the quarter, including expenses related to stock-based compensation. Snap's user base increased by more than 20% year-on-year. But the firm added just seven million new users in the quarter, compared to eight million in the first three months of the year. Shares in the firm fell more than 14% in after-hours trade. Mr Spiegel said the company was making \"a lot of progress\". He estimated that a quarter of people with smart phones in the US, UK and France use Snapchat every day, with users typically spending more than 30 minutes daily on the site. Snap is not the only young company that has stumbled after going public while facing off with one of the tech giants. The prepared meal company Blue Apron, which started trading in June, has also lost much of its value. Analysts say Amazon's plan to acquire Whole Foods, combining its delivery strength with a well-known grocer, has dimmed its prospects.

It said director general Tony Hall would explain that such behaviour could not be tolerated at the BBC. Clarkson tweeted a rebuttal of the story on Wednesday morning. \"Just to keep everyone up to date, I haven't heard a thing,\" he wrote, shortly before 10:00 GMT. The BBC also says no final decision had been made on Clarkson's future. \"When we have an outcome, we will announce it,\" said a BBC spokesman. Clarkson was suspended 16 days ago following an alleged \"fracas\" with producer Oisin Tymon. The row was said to have occurred because no hot food was laid on for the presenter following a day's filming in North Yorkshire. An internal investigation began last week, led by Ken MacQuarrie, the director of BBC Scotland. Mr Tymon did not file a formal complaint and it is understood Clarkson reported himself to BBC bosses. The BBC's director of television, Danny Cohen, felt he had no choice but to suspend the presenter pending an investigation. The decision caused an outpouring of support from Top Gear fans, with more than a million people signing an online petition to reinstate him. Whatever the outcome of the BBC's inquiry, the motoring show is expected to continue. It is one of BBC Two's most popular programmes, and overseas sales generate an estimated \u00a350m a year for the corporation's commercial arm, BBC Worldwide. Whether Clarkson's co-presenters James May and Richard Hammond would continue in his absence has yet to be confirmed. All three have their contracts up for renewal this year. Meanwhile Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans, who has been touted as a potential replacement for Clarkson, has ruled himself out of the running. \"Not only is it not true, it's absolute nonsense,\" he told listeners on Wednesday morning. \"From what I've seen on Twitter and various social media, there's a 50/50 split approximately as to whether me being involved in the show is a good idea. \"In TV or radio, if you get a 50/50 love/hate reaction that usually equals massive hit. I used to work for [ratings body] Barb and knock on people's doors and this was the rule of thumb. \"However, I'm in the no camp. So regardless of whether it would be a hit, I'm voting a no for myself on that show, so that's never going happen. \"And that's the end of that.\" Speaking later to reporters outside Radio 2, Evans refused to speculate on who else might replace Clarkson, saying he \"doesn't know if the post is available yet\".", "abstract": "Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson says he \"hasn't heard a thing\", after press reports suggested the BBC would sack him on Wednesday.", "candidate": "Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson has denied reports he is to be dropped from the BBC show.", "doc_id": 3434, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Top Gear presenter Clarkson has denied reports he is to be dropped from the BBC show.", "evidence": "Clarkson tweeted a rebuttal of the story on Wednesday morning.", "explanation": "Source text supports all facts about the presenter and the show except first name of the presenter mentioned in the summary.", "instruction": "Remove the information about first name of the presenter mentioned from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about first name of the presenter mentioned from the summary."]}}
{"article": "This is the principle that all websites and apps should be equally accessible. Travel portal Cleartrip.com and media giant Times Group both announced they would be withdrawing from the service, citing competition fears. But Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg defended Internet.org's aims. The service aims to extend internet services to the developing world by offering a selection of apps and websites free to consumers. Telecoms firms absorb the data costs associated with handling Internet.org traffic. But many companies fear this distorts the market and makes it harder for small companies to get their products seen by the public. Currently, Indian visitors to Internet.org can access nearly 40 stripped-down services, including job, healthcare, news and education sites. Times Group blogged that it was appealing \"to all publishers to jointly withdraw from Internet.org\" and said that the Times of India newspaper would also withdraw \"if its direct competitors - India Today, NDTV, IBNLive, NewsHunt, and [the] BBC - also pull out\". The BBC has yet to respond to the call. A Times Group spokesman said: \"We support net neutrality because it creates a fair, level playing field for all companies - big and small - to produce the best service and offer it to consumers. \"We will lead the drive towards a neutral internet, but we need our fellow publishers and content providers to do so as well, so that the playing field continues to be level.\" Cleartrip said the debate around net neutrality had given it \"pause to rethink\" its approach to Internet.org. \"What started off with providing a simple search service has us now concerned with influencing customer decision-making by forcing options on them, something that is against our core DNA,\" wrote Subramanya Sharma, Cleartrip's chief marketing officer.

Start-up developers with little funding could therefore be at a commercial disadvantage, tech firms argue.

India has the world's third-largest internet population and is the first Asian country to get the service.

Davies says the current demands on players are \"unsustainable\", prompting talks over a \"global season\". He says the WRU held \"discussions\" with New Zealand in June over the issue. Recently installed World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont said moving the Six Nations to April \"could be a solution\" in a global calendar. The idea was on the agenda in 2003 amid concerns over fixture overlaps and clashes between clubs and countries. In 2014 the Rugby Players' Association, representing players in England, urged changes to the playing calendar for the sake of player welfare. Davies witnessed Wales' 18-Test season ending in a 3-0 whitewash against the All Blacks in June, a year after preparations for the 2015 World Cup started. \"The main reason for the global season is player welfare, to try to cut down the numbers of games players are playing,\" Davies told BBC Radio Wales. \"Our guys were in New Zealand in June, July. They started training the first week of June the previous year. \"The New Zealand guys couldn't get over it. These guys had been going for 13 months playing international rugby - that is not sustainable. \"And it was a World Cup year and exceptional year etc, finishing with the New Zealand tour.\" For southern hemisphere teams, hosting rivals from the northern hemisphere also disrupts their Super Rugby domestic tournament calendar. Davies added: \"Basically they want us to move a month or so so they can have a clear run-in. \"I think we see it, just moving three or four weeks is not going to help the northern hemisphere with player welfare, for example. \"So it is a bigger question than just the Six Nations. That is being looked at at the moment. \"There's a Six Nations council meeting at the end of this month and this isn't to fuel speculation, it is an annual review of where the Six Nations sits. \"So is it worth considering moving it? Do we look at bonus points, which is something that people have asked for to make it more exciting, scoring tries etc? \"Do we look at 'is it a closed shop for Six Nations?' Do we open the gates to Georgia, Romania or anybody else who is deemed worthy and is capable of being in there? \"So all those are up for grabs really. \"Moving the Six Nations - I don't see it as a problem if it helps other things. \"I don't think we need to move it for the sake of it because it does work where it is now - it gets huge following, huge TV audiences etc. \"But if it were necessary to move it in order that it were a piece of the jigsaw that enabled northern and southern hemispheres to have a coherent global season, then it's worth doing.\" Wales' next international fixture is against Australia at the Principality Stadium on Saturday, 5 November.

{"article": "Mr Abdel Fattah had been sentenced to 15 years in jail for violating a strict anti-protest law. He is currently facing a retrial in the case. Mr Abdel Fattah gained fame during the 2011 uprising against the then-President, Hosni Mubarak. His arrest had heightened fears of a crackdown on dissent in Egypt. Correspondents say the 15-year sentence was one of the harshest ever awarded to a non-Islamist activist in the country. Mr Abdel Fattah had been charged with assaulting a policeman at an illegal protest. He was sentenced in June, along with 24 others, but was not allowed to be in court for the verdict. The same judges presided over his retrial, prompting Mr Abdel Fattah to complain that he had \"no confidence\" in them. A lawyer for Mr Abdel Fattah, Mohammed Abdel-Aziz, said on Monday that the judge presiding over the retrial had stepped down at the request of the defence team. He said the judge had also ordered an investigation into the prosecutor's use of Mr Abdul Fattah's personal videos, \"which violated the accused's privacy\". At a previous hearing, the prosecutor had shown videos of family celebrations which had no link to the case, Mr Abdel-Aziz told AFP news agency. The retrial will resume when a new judge is assigned to the case. Mr Abdel Fattah is expected to leave prison on Tuesday. Along with two other activists, whose release was also ordered by the court, he must pay 5,000 Egyptian pounds ($430; $700) as bail. Mr Abdel Fattah comes from a prominent family of Egyptian activists. His sister, Sanaa Seif, is also in custody on charges of violating the protest law. His father, Ahmed Seif al-Islam, was a leading human rights lawyer and campaigner who died late last month. Hundreds of people have been killed in street clashes since the military ousted President Mohammed Morsi last year. Thousands have also been arrested, most of them Islamists who supported Mr Morsi. The crackdown has since been extended to student leaders and secular activists who had protested against Mr Mubarak. Former army chief Abdul Fattah al-Sisi took office as president after winning 96.9% of the vote in elections in May - almost a year after he ousted Mr Morsi. However turnout was below 50%, as Mr Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood and some liberal and secular activists urged a boycott of the poll. Also on Monday, an Egyptian court sentenced the Muslim Brotherhood's leader, Mohammed Badie, and 14 others to life in jail on charges of murder and inciting violence at protests near Cairo last year.

{"article": "Peter Lloyd, 45, lives in a tent in the garden of an \"uninhabitable\" house, Cardiff Civil Justice Centre heard. Mr Lloyd, who has electromagnetic hypersensitivity, said he was entitled to direct payments to employ a helper. The council, which was ordered to pay \u00c2\u00a312,000 in costs, had claimed he was not capable of managing money. Quashing the council's decision on Wednesday, Mr Justice Singh said electromagnetic hypersensitivity was not a recognised condition in the UK. He added it was \"not a matter for the court to say what the decision would have been if the authority went about its decision correctly\". Direct payments are given to individuals by councils so they can buy help or services instead of having them supplied by the authority. Mr Lloyd lives in the back garden of a privately-owned home in Thornhill and has refused alternative accommodation and a portable toilet, the court heard. He urinates in plastic bottles and defecates in bed pans lined with black bin bags. He has no running water and an insurance company deemed the house uninhabitable after flooding and the discovery of asbestos - although that has since been removed. When council workers went to collect Mr Lloyd's waste in May, they found 90 litres of urine and 40 bags of faeces. He has meals delivered five times a week, including supplies for the weekend on a Friday. As he has no fridge, he has to have food which will not go off.

{"article": "Government air strikes in recent days have pounded rebel-held areas of Aleppo, where more than 250,000 civilians are trapped. Britain's permanent representative to the UN said the attacks had \"unleashed a new hell on Aleppo\", which he described as war crimes. In the middle of the conflict there are at least 100,000 children, aid agencies estimate. On Sunday, Save the Children warned that approximately half the casualties being treated in eastern Aleppo were children. It said injured children were dying on the floors of hospitals due to shortages of equipment and medicines. \"Across the board things have never been worse for Syrian children,\" the group's humanitarian emergencies spokesperson, Caroline Anning, told the BBC. Rawan has reportedly lost her entire family, including four siblings, Sky News reports. But why are children so badly affected in the battle for Aleppo? Syria's population, like that of many other countries in the region, is relatively young, with an estimated median age of 24.1. About half of the nearly five million refugees who have fled Syria are children. But eight million children remain in the war-torn country, according to Unicef. In eastern Aleppo, Save the Children estimates about 40% of the besieged population are children. While this means the recent casualty numbers it reported appear to be roughly proportionate with the population, it is out of step with what should be happening in a war zone. In war, you should expect to see a much higher population of adult males being killed in frontline action, Ms Anning says. \"But what we have seen in Aleppo in the last couple of days is totally indiscriminate bombing from the air,\" she says. \"So children are impacted just as much or more than adults in those situations.\" These tactics, combined with a continued siege preventing anyone from leaving the area, has created one of the worst situations for Syrian children in more than five years of war. When bombs rain down on densely populated urban areas like eastern Aleppo, there is nowhere to escape. And children are inherently vulnerable. \"They will often be playing outside, their movements will sometimes be less predictable, they may not instinctively run from danger,\" Hannah Stoddard, advocacy director for the War Child charity says. This is compounded by the fact that school and hospitals, places where children are more likely to be present, are being targeted by the Syrian government. In terms of injuries, children are also at greater risk. Blood loss is more devastating for them and fractures occur more easily. The images of Alan Kurdi, Omran Daqneesh and now Rawan Alowsh might have captured fleeting global attention, but they are by no means exceptional cases that happened to be captured on film. Rescue teams are finding children every day under piles of rubble. \"What pictures don't show is the mental scars that [these] children carry with them,\" says Ms Stoddard of War Child, which works with Syrian refugee children in Jordan. \"In the majority of cases, these children have lost one or more family members. They may be the sole survivor.\" An immediate ceasefire is a prerequisite to any solution that could bring an end to the suffering of Aleppo's children, aid groups say. Given the breakdown of a US and Russian brokered ceasefire last week and a spike in tensions between the two powers, the prospects for this appear slim. Still, if a ceasefire were to happen, sustained humanitarian access to all besieged areas could be possible, Ms Anning says. Groups need to be able to freely move in \"whatever aid is needed without preconditions, and evacuate medical casualties.\"", "abstract": "The haunting cries of five-year-old Rawan Alowsh, pulled alive from rubble in Aleppo by her ponytail, have reminded the world once again that behind the politics of Syria's civil war are millions of vulnerable children.", "candidate": "Rawan, the three-year-old Syrian girl killed in an air strike in the city of Aleppo on Sunday, is the latest child to be killed in the fighting.", "doc_id": 2849, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Eight million children are still in war-torn Syria despite heavy casualties.", "evidence": "\"Across the board things have never been worse for Syrian children,\" the group's humanitarian emergencies spokesperson, Caroline Anning, told the BBC.", "explanation": "the girl mentioned was never aged and was not clarified as dead.", "instruction": "Rewrite the summary by Mentioning the number of children still in Syria, that the country is war-torn and that there are many casualties.", "instruction_list": ["Rewrite the summary by Mentioning the number of children still in Syria, that the country is war-torn and that there are many casualties."]}}

But the South Wales Police officer from Abercrave, Powys, denied it was him and changed his number plates, Cardiff Crown Court heard. He denied perverting the course of justice but a jury found him guilty. Judge David Wynn Morgan told Rees-Thompson the offence \"strikes at the heart of the criminal justice system\". He said the points system was to punish people who drive badly, and it depended on the honest completion of the relevant forms. He added: \"Yours wasn't a panic reaction - it was a carefully considered and thought out course of action.\" The court heard Rees-Thompson had been driving along Fabian Way on his way to buy tickets for an Ospreys rugby match when he was caught speeding in a car belonging to his stepfather, who was away on holiday. The defendant, who has worked for South Wales Police for 10 years, challenged the fixed penalty notice and was asked to submit photographic proof that it was not the same vehicle. But the court heard he sent in photographs of the silver Vauxhall Corsa with new plates customised with a blue GB sign and the Welsh flag, bought for \u00c2\u00a321 online.

The venture will combine an education centre for young people with learning difficulties and an exhibition on the home, the song and Lennon's early life. The gates at the site, which is closed to the public, are a popular attraction for Beatles fans visiting Liverpool. The plans were announced on the 50th anniversary of the release of the single, which was a double-A side with Penny Lane, reaching number two in the UK charts and number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the USA. The original home in Woolton was demolished in the early 1970s and replaced with a smaller building. Major Drew McCombe, divisional leader for the North West branch of the charity, said: \"Strawberry Field is special in the hearts of many people in Liverpool, the UK and across the world, and we at the Salvation Army are aiming to redevelop the site to do justice to the many people that have been supported by the children's home or formed a connection with the iconic Beatles song.\" According to Blue Badge Beatles tour guide Neil McDonald, the gates are one of the must-see Beatles sights in the city. He said: \"It is a unique atmosphere. I've seen some people burst into tears and even proposals of marriage.\" According to Hunter Davies's biography of The Beatles, one of Lennon's childhood treats was the garden party that took place each summer on the grounds of Strawberry Field. His Aunt Mimi recalled: \"As soon as we could hear the Salvation Army band starting, John would jump up and down shouting 'Mimi, come on. We're going to be late.'\" The musician is said to have found a place of peace and refuge from his troubled childhood in the woods around the home, where he went to play with friends, climb trees and dream the hours away.

{"article": "The international team analysed 77 genes. Individually they each had a low impact on cancer risk, but were a powerful combination. The findings, in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, could eventually transform screening, preventive treatments and even HRT. Cancer charities said the field was developing rapidly. The genetic tests that have already been developed are restricted, in the UK, to those women with the very highest risk of developing breast cancer. They look for changes such as mutations in the BRCA genes that led the Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie to have her breasts and ovaries removed. They can give up to a 90% chance of cancer in a woman's lifetime, but are rare. The team, led by the Institute of Cancer Research in London and the University of Cambridge, looked at the parts of the genetic code that have a more subtle effect yet will influence every woman's chance of cancer. Of the 77 cancer-risk sites in the DNA inherited from the mother and the matching 77 from the father, an average woman would have 66. It allowed the team to calculate the probability of women developing breast cancer. \"These are quite substantial risks,\" said Prof Montserrat Garcia-Closas, of the Institute of Cancer Research. She told the BBC News website: \"I think it's very exciting at the moment. The discovery of these variants has progressed very quickly in the last five years and I think it's reaching a plateau. And at that point it's time to start designing a genetic test that includes all these elements. That's likely to be reached within a year.\" The ability to accurately predict the risk of breast cancer could have a powerful impact on medicine. It could clearly show which women need drugs, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, to reduce the risk of breast cancer. The lowest-risk women may not need breast cancer screening, while those at highest risk might need to start earlier. Hormone replacement therapy has many benefits, but it does increase the risk of cancer. So knowing the background genetic risk could also inform who should and should not have HRT. But one of the great challenges will be to combine these tests with current techniques. Prof Douglas Easton, of the University of Cambridge, said: \"We've now reached a crucial stage at which all this research can be combined to help target screening and advice to those women who need them the most. \"There's still work to be done to determine how tests like this could complement other risk factors, such as age, lifestyle and family history, but it's a major step in the right direction that will hopefully see genetic risk prediction become part of routine breast screening in the years to come.\" Dr Matthew Lam, of the charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: \"In recent years we've learnt so much about genetic risk factors of breast cancer. What's great to see now is that these findings are starting to be translated into practical methods to predict risk.\" Nell Barrie, of Cancer Research UK, said: \"This study shows how the genetic map of breast cancer that scientists have been building up over the years might be used to identify women most at risk, so we can take steps to reduce their chances of developing the disease or catch it at the earliest possible stage.\"", "abstract": "Scientists have predicted the odds of women developing breast cancer by looking for tiny errors in their DNA.", "candidate": "Scientists say they have unlocked the genetic secrets of breast cancer.", "doc_id": 3054, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "It allowed the team to calculate the probability of women developing breast cancer.", "explanation": "the original summary is correct because its claims about genetic secrets being unlocked are supported by the source text that talks about how scientists have analyzed genes that could be used to accurately predict the risk of breast cancer.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

{"article": "Government plans would give applicants a right to complain to an employment tribunal if they believed they had suffered discrimination. Jeremy Hunt said he wanted to create \"a culture of openness\" where staff feel they can speak up about patient safety. Barrister Sir Robert Francis recommended the measure after a public inquiry into Stafford Hospital deaths. Protecting NHS whistleblowers was a key recommendation from the inquiry into the scandal, which resulted in the trust that ran Stafford Hospital being fined \u00c2\u00a3500,000 for \"basic\" blunders linked to the deaths of four patients. Sir Robert, the inquiry chairman, warned that staff often faced bullying and isolation if they tried to speak out and that staff struggled to find new jobs in the NHS. Under the UK-wide plans, applicants for an NHS job would have the right to complain to an employment tribunal if they had been discriminated against because they had previously raised concerns about the safety of patients. Applicants would also have the right to bring a claim in court in order to prevent discriminatory conduct. And the draft guidelines, which are out for consultation, say that discrimination of an applicant by an NHS worker should be treated like discrimination by the NHS body itself. Health Secretary Mr Hunt said: \"Today we move another step closer to creating a culture of openness in the NHS, where people who have the courage to speak up about patient safety concerns are listened to, not vilified.\" He said the changes would ensure \"staff feel they are protected with the law on their side\". There has been a growing focus on patient safety since Sir Robert's inquiry in 2013. One of the main findings of that report was that people within the NHS had known about the poor levels of care at the hospital, but did not raise the alarm. Since then, a number of initiatives have been launched to improve safety. In 2015, the government introduced plans to appoint guardians to support staff who wanted to speak up about concerns over patient safety. Peter Walsh, chief executive of Action against Medical Accidents, said the plans were modest, but a \"welcome move in the right direction\". \"It is clearly unfair that staff who have been forced to become 'whistleblowers' should be discriminated against when they seek alternative jobs. \"However, this is a symptom of a much deeper cultural problem in the NHS which will not be solved with tinkering with rules here and there. \"So far we have not seen a joined-up approach to supporting and protecting staff from unfair treatment when they try to do the right thing and end up having to be whistleblowers.\" Mr Walsh said many NHS trusts had still not appointed guardians, as recommended by the Stafford Hospital inquiry.

{"article": "Zaur Dadayev shot the former deputy prime minister, a vocal critic of President Vladimir Putin, in February 2015 near the Kremlin. Four others acted as accomplices. The group were allegedly promised $250,000 (\u00c2\u00a3192,000) to kill Nemtsov. They all denied the charges. Nemtsov's relatives fear that whoever ordered the murder will never be found. Russian authorities are still looking for another Chechen said to be behind the killing, Ruslan Mukhudinov. He believed to have fled abroad. But lawyers for Nemtsov's family have said the investigators have exaggerated Mr Mukhudinov's role and \"the masterminds are high-ranking people\". The jury in Moscow convicted the five men after more than eight months of hearings. Zaur Dadayev is former member of an elite military unit. He was under the command of pro-Moscow's Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Russia's Chechen Republic in the North Caucasus. The other four defendants are brothers Anzor Gubashev and Shadid Gubashev, Khamzat Bakhayev and Tamerlan Eskerkhanov. A sixth man, Beslan Shabanov, died while he was being detained in Chechnya. Nemtsov served as first deputy prime minister under President Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s, and later became a vocal critic of President Putin. The 55-year-old was shot dead on 27 February 2015 on his way from a restaurant in central Moscow. Earlier that day he was interviewed on a liberal radio station, in which he had called on listeners to join a rally. At the time, Nemtsov was working on a report examining Russia's alleged role in the conflict in Ukraine. President Putin called the murder \"vile and cynical\" and vowed to hold those responsible to account. Russia has seen several killings of high-profile politicians and journalists in recent years. But the country has a long history of prosecuting alleged hit-men and failing to follow the chain of command to discover who ordered the murder, correspondents say. It took the 12 jury members more than 12 hours to reach their verdict. They spent it in a closed room in one corner of the military courthouse with a guard posted outside the window. But when they finally filed back into court, it was to pronounce every one of the accused guilty. In each case they ruled by a clear majority. Standing opposite them inside a glass cage, surrounded by armed police and a Rottweiler, the men from Chechnya listened in silence, looking relaxed and even smiling as they had for much of this trial. There was speculation that one of the accused, Khamzat Bakhayev, might be acquitted for lack of evidence. When the jury found him guilty too, his wife burst into tears. But outside, lawyers representing Boris Nemtsov's family said they believe the trail of evidence leads to senior figures within Chechnya, loyal to Vladimir Putin.

{"article": "It said the \"irresponsible\" advert for meal delivery service Diet Chef implied happiness and self-confidence could only be achieved through weight loss. The advert featured a woman, Cheryl, before and after using the service. Diet Chef said the advert showed her sense of achievement after taking control of her lifestyle. It said the actor who played both versions of Cheryl had a Body Mass Index of 27.4 when she played the earlier version, which was in the overweight category. In the advert, the later Cheryl tells her former self: \"I know how you feel; you can look that good again, you know,\" and \"I bought a bikini last week, for the first time since this picture.\" The former Cheryl says: \"You look amazing. I never dreamed I could be that slim again.\" The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received complaints from 26 viewers objecting that the advert was irresponsible for exploiting women's body insecurities by implying that they needed to be slim to be happy. Complainants also said it implied that overweight women did not take care of themselves or how they looked. The former Cheryl was shown wearing a baggy shirt and had messy hair, while the current, happier Cheryl had a more polished appearance. Diet Chef said the ad showed the frustration of the former Cheryl, who did not feel able to make a change in her lifestyle or to maintain a controlled diet and so was surprised that she had done so, and the sense of achievement of the later Cheryl. It also said the advert's approach was typical of the \"before and after\" genre commonly used to advertise weight loss products. The ASA said the advert did not give the impression that former Cheryl had neglected her personal appearance and said viewers would be unlikely to find this part of the advert offensive. But it said the character's unhappy demeanour while talking about wearing a bikini appeared disproportionate to concerns about her weight, especially as she did not appear to be particularly overweight. The ASA said the advert \"implied that weight loss was the only solution to her problems\". It went on: \"It therefore implied that those with insecurities about their bodies, and particularly their weight, could only achieve happiness and self-confidence through weight loss. \"We therefore concluded that the ad presented a socially irresponsible approach to body image and breached the code.\" It ruled that the advert must not appear again in its current form and told Diet Chef \"to ensure that their products were advertised in a socially responsible way\".", "abstract": "A television advert in which a tearful woman meets a slimmer and happier version of herself has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority.", "candidate": "An advert for a weight loss service has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority for exploiting women's body insecurities.", "doc_id": 1115, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "\"We therefore concluded that the ad presented a socially irresponsible approach to body image and breached the code.\"", "explanation": "The summary is correct because \"The Advertising Standards Authority\" \"We therefore concluded that the ad presented a socially irresponsible approach to body image and breached the code.\", and \"It ruled that the advert must not appear again in its current form \" is supported by ssource text.

{"article": "Sgt Elor Azaria, 20, shot Abdul Fatah al-Sharif, 21, in the head while he was lying immobile on a road. The incident happened in Hebron in the occupied West Bank last March, after another soldier was stabbed. Sgt Azaria said he thought Sharif might have an explosive vest, but prosecutors said his motive was revenge. The high-profile trial has proven extremely divisive in Israel, says the BBC's Yolande Knell in Tel Aviv. There have been rallies to support the soldier and some senior politicians backed Sgt Azaria. However, top military figures were quick to say that his actions did not reflect the values of the Israel Defence Forces (IDF). In the incident on 24 March, Sharif and another 21-year-old Palestinian, Ramzi Aziz al-Qasrawi, stabbed and wounded an Israeli soldier before troops opened fire on them, wounding Sharif and killing Qasrawi. Footage of the scene several minutes later, filmed by a Palestinian and released by the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, shows Sharif alive. A soldier, identified as Sgt Azaria, is then seen cocking his rifle and fatally shooting Sharif from several metres away. In their indictment, prosecutors said Sgt Azaria \"violated the rules of engagement without operational justification as the terrorist was lying on the ground wounded and represented no immediate threat for the accused or others who were present\". Delivering the verdict on Wednesday, the panel of three military judges rejected Sgt Azaria's defence that he shot Sharif because he continued to pose a threat. He had told the court that he believed there might be a suicide belt under the Palestinian's jacket. The judges, who took two-and-a-half hours to deliver their verdict, noted that Sgt Azaria's company and battalion commanders had testified that he did not mention the same concerns when they questioned him immediately after the shooting incident. The judges also said there was no dispute regarding the veracity of the statements made by another soldier, who testified to military investigators that Sgt Azaria had told him during the incident: \"They stabbed my friend and tried to kill him - he deserves to die.\" Sgt Azaria told the court that he did not recall having any such conversation, but the head of the judging panel, Col Maya Heller, described him as an \"unreliable witness\". \"His motive for shooting was that he felt the terrorist deserved to die,\" she said. Prosecutor Lt Col Nadav Weissman said: \"This is not a happy day for us. We would have preferred that this didn't happen. But the deed was done, and the offence was severe.\" A spokesman for Sgt Azaria's family said evidence proving his innocence had been ignored. \"It was like the court was detached from the fact that this was the area of an attack,\" he said. The soldier's mother, Oshra, shouted at the judges: \"You should be ashamed of yourselves.\" The defence team has said it will appeal against the verdict. Sentencing is expected in the next few weeks. Manslaughter in Israel carries a maximum 20-year term. Sharif's father Yusri was quoted as saying Sgt Azaria deserved a life sentence. Sharif's uncle, Fathi, told Haaretz that the decision to try him for manslaughter rather than murder was \"a perversion of justice and of the court\". Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who expressed support for Sgt Azaria before taking office in May, said the verdict was \"difficult\" and that the defence establishment would \"do everything it can to assist the soldier and his family\". But he also called on the public to respect the court's decision. Sari Bashi, Israel advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, described the verdict as \"a positive step toward reining in excessive use of force by Israeli soldiers against Palestinians\". The shooting happened during a wave of knife, gun and vehicle ramming attacks by Palestinians or Israeli Arabs in Israel and the West Bank that has killed at least 42 people since September 2015, according to the Israeli authorities. Human Rights Watch said on Monday that video footage or witness accounts raised serious questions about many of the more than 150 instances in which Israeli forces have fatally shot Palestinians during attacks or attempted attacks on Israelis.", "abstract": "An Israeli soldier filmed shooting dead a wounded Palestinian attacker after he had been disarmed of a knife has been convicted of manslaughter.", "candidate": "An Israeli soldier has been found guilty of manslaughter over the fatal shooting of a wounded Palestinian attacker.", "doc_id": 2639, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "Delivering the verdict on Wednesday, the panel of three military judges rejected Sgt Azaria's defence that he shot Sharif because he continued to pose a threat.", "explanation": "the original summary is correct, all its statements about the crime and verdict are supported by the source text.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

{"article": "But none of the groups fighting on the ground have been invited. So absent from the talks will be both the Assad government and the Syrian political opposition, as well as the myriad other rebel militias fighting the Assad regime. Syria's Kurds won't be present, and of course jihadist militants of the so-called Islamic State (IS) won't be either. But the hope is that if outside powers can bridge their differences, it could be a first step towards influencing at least some of the warring sides. And some things have changed since the last abortive diplomatic push to end Syria's war: Iran's nuclear deal has made it a more acceptable partner to the United States and its allies. Russia has more incentive to push for peace: to keep its military involvement in Syria limited. The mounting refugee crisis has increased pressure on Syria's neighbours and on European countries too. And there is growing alarm at the way IS militants keep extending their reach. The focus (not for the first time) will be on how to agree a political process, including changes to Syria's constitution and new elections, to open the door to a broader transition. The main sticking point remains President Bashar al-Assad's role, and whether he should be allowed to stay or at some point be forced to stand down. So where do the most important countries attending the Vienna talks now stand? The United States and other Western powers (who held a pre-meeting in Paris to present a united front in Vienna) have shifted slightly recently. They no longer say Mr Assad must go as soon as possible, but rather that a transition must guarantee that he departs under a precise timetable. Saudi Arabia and Turkey, which had been insistent Mr Assad must go, may also be softening their position somewhat. The Saudi foreign minister on Wednesday still insisted he must step down, but within a specific time frame. But Russia and Iran, both backing President Assad militarily, claim he is a necessary partner in the fight against IS jihadists, and whether he stays or goes is not a matter for outside powers, but for the Syrian people to decide in elections. What is less clear is whether behind the scenes they are prepared to be more flexible, or less. Russia's President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly denounced elected leaders being ousted under pressure. He recently invited Mr Assad to Moscow to show him his support. But senior Russian officials have usually been careful to offer support to Syria's legitimate government, rather than Mr Assad himself. So would Russia support a compromise? Iran meanwhile has said there is no reason for Mr Assad to go, since he won re-election last year and his term should last until 2021. Will Tehran make him staying in power a red line? If there were no agreement in Vienna it would not be surprising, but it could also be dangerous. The Saudi government said it was coming to see if Russia and Iran were serious about a peace process, and if not, it would know not to waste time on them.

Seven US FBI bomb experts are heading to Stockholm to help the investigation, Sweden's intelligence agency said. Although Abdaly was a Swedish citizen, he had been living in the UK. British police have been searching a house in Luton, north of London, where Abdaly lived. Mr Lindstrand said Swedish police were now trying to work out what the bomber's target had been before he blew himself up prematurely. \"He had a bomb belt on him, he had a backpack with a bomb and he was carrying an object that has been compared to a pressure cooker. If it had all blown up at the same time, it would have been very powerful,\" he said. A car containing gas canisters blew up first in a busy shopping street in the area of Drottninggatan at 1700 local time (1600 GMT) followed minutes later by a explosion in a street about 300m (985ft) away that killed the bomber. Abdaly was named as the registered owner of the car. Mr Lindstrand said they believed the bomber had intended to kill \"as many people as possible\". \"Where he was headed... we don't know,\" he said. \"It is likely that something happened, that he made some kind of mistake [and] part of the bombs he was carrying went off and caused his death. \"This was during Christmas shopping in central Stockholm and he was extremely well-equipped when it came to bomb material. It is not much of a stretch to say he was going to a place with as many people as possible.\" Mr Lindstrand said possible targets included the city's central train station or to Aahlens, a popular department store. In a profile on the Muslim dating website Muslima, Abdaly said he was born in Baghdad and moved to Sweden in 1992, before arriving in the UK in 2001 to study. He said he had got married in 2004 and had two young daughters. \"I want to get married again, and would like to have a big family. My wife agreed to this,\" he wrote. Mr Lindstrand said Abdaly was completely unknown to Swedish security services before the blasts. However, he pointed out: \"He didn't live in Sweden; he lived in the UK. He left Sweden maybe 10 years ago.\" Meanwhile, British police have been searching Abdaly's house in Luton. His wife and children are reported to live in the UK, although their exact whereabouts are not known. It has emerged that Abdaly had attended the Luton Islamic Centre but left after other members accused him of having a \"distorted view\" of Islam. A Swedish news agency has released an audio recording apparently made by Abdaly, in which he says oppression against Muslims in Europe will not be tolerated. He refers to drawings of the Prophet Muhammad and to the presence of foreign soldiers - including Swedes - in Afghanistan. If confirmed as a suicide bombing, the attack would be the first of its kind in Sweden. In pictures: Stockholm blasts . Sweden's Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt has said the attacks are unacceptable in Sweden's \"open society\", which he said was a democracy that respected different cultures. The blast appears to have been of the same relatively unsophisticated nature as recent attempted attacks in New York, Glasgow and London, says BBC security correspondent Nick Childs.

{"article": "Phillip Smith, 40, was arrested in a hostel in Rio de Janeiro by Brazilian police. He is expected to be extradited or deported. Smith used a passport in his birth name, Phillip Traynor, to fly to Chile and then go to Brazil on 6 November. He escaped while on a three-day release from a prison south of Auckland. Smith was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1996 after he murdered the father of a 13-year-old boy he had sexually abused between 1992 and 1995. The family had moved house but he had tracked the boy to their new home in Wellington in December 1995. He repeatedly stabbed the father, killing him. The boy managed to escaped and raise the alarm. The victim, who is now 30, told New Zealand's Fairfax media after news of Smith's capture, that he could now stop sleeping with a knife under his pillow. \"It's great news, it's excellent,\" he said from his new home in Australia. \"[I feel] relief, a bit of peace of mind that I can carry on with my life without having that fear over my shoulder.\" Smith's escape has thrown Corrections and various other government agencies into controversy. It has led to calls for an overhaul of short-term prison release and the monitoring of high-risk offenders. In an email Smith sent to Radio New Zealand he said he had planned the escape by running a criminal check on his birth name and discovering that it had not been red-flagged. \"My only anxiety was that somebody that knew me might happen to be at the airport at the same time to identify me,'' he wrote, according to Radio NZ. He also said he had been able to fund the escape with money from various businesses he had run from prison. Smith said he chose Brazil because he thought it would be more difficult to extradite him if he was caught, as the two countries do not have a formal extradition treaty. He was arrested after a member of the public in Rio De Janeiro recognised him from images being circulated in hostels and tipped off police. Smith appeared in court after his arrest and has been remanded in custody for 60 days. New Zealand Police Detective Superintendent Mike Pannett said in a press conference on Thursday that it was a relief to have Smith back in custody. He would not, however, say how long he expected Smith to remain in Brazil. \"New Zealand will bring him back as soon as possible but we are reliant on the Brazilian justice system to process and deal with the situation,\" Mr Pannett said. Criminal Bar Association President Tony Bouchier said police needed to be more thorough when checking the names of criminals. \"There's got to be a far more robust process gone through when police are entering people's names into their systems and starting somebody off with a criminal record,\" he told Radio NZ.

{"article": "The Lib Dem MP for Bristol West said pubs in parts of the city were closing because of the decline of the \"white working class\" and the arrival of migrants from Somalia and elsewhere. He said reports of his remarks had been \"twisted\" to suggest a focus on race. He had simply been proposing derelict premises should be converted, he said. The comments were made as Mr Williams was outlining a government proposal to protect community pubs. The plan involves changing the law to prevent places listed as assets of community value being demolished or having their use changed without planning permission. Some campaigners had called for the government to go further and impose a blanket ban on the redevelopment of all pubs without planning permission. Arguing against a blanket ban, Mr Williams told MPs: \"In my own constituency, lots of pubs have closed - but it is usually because of demographic change. \"Some parts of my constituency, which had a 'white working-class community' 20 or 30 years ago, are now populated primarily by recently arrived Somalis and other people. \"Obviously the pubs in those areas have closed, and some have been converted to other uses, but some of them are still derelict. \"What the government is proposing is to look at the public houses that are genuinely popular and valued by the community now, giving them protection that is already allowed in the Localism Act and further enhancing that protection in terms of the planning laws, saying you cannot convert this pub into another use or demolish it without planning permission.\" Some reports, including one in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, with the headline \"'Somali immigrants' cause pub closures\", had taken his comments out of context, Mr Williams said. \"There was no value judgement in what I said.

{"article": "There's no doubt he's getting back to his best form just in time for his fourth final, but he's striking a blow against sexism in tennis too. In early 2014, Murray split with his then coach Ivan Lendl - who'd helped Andy become a Grand Slam champion. His decision to replace Lendl with Amelie Mauresmo prompted more than a few raised eyebrows. Never before had a top male player hired a woman as coach (except for Jimmy Connors but the woman in charge of his game was his mother Gloria, so it doesn't count). The early signs for the new partnership weren't good. Murray appeared to be slipping back into some bad habits, playing defensively and berating himself in the process. Despite a late season surge, 2014 was Murray's most forgettable year since establishing himself as one of the \"Big Four\". Had Murray continued his iffy form into the Australian Open, there's no doubt the vultures would have been circling over the Murray-Mauresmo axis. But they'll have to wait as his early season form is arguably better than ever. His play against Tomas Berdych had Mauresmo's finger prints all over it - full of variety and controlled aggression. It was certainly Grand Slam-winning form, and if he can keep it up a first Australian Open title is definitely on the cards. \"A lot of people criticised me for working with her,\" Murray said in his on-court interview. \"So far this week we've shown that women can be good coaches as well.\" Mum Judy has always played a strong role in Andy's career, and she hailed the impact Amelie was having off the court, describing her as a \"calming influence\". Many male players have been dismissive of the women's game, albeit not as noisily as in the past. The 1996 Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek famously dismissed 80% of the women's tour as \"fat pigs\" in 1992. Last year, Rafael Nadal's uncle Toni criticised the appointment of a woman as Spain's Davis Cup captain. \"Men's tennis isn't the same as women's tennis,\" he said.

{"article": "But did you ever stop to think what this means? What are terms and conditions, and why do you have to agree to them? Read on to find out more. Terms and conditions are rules you have to agree to before you can use certain products or services, like social media. Last year, Newsround found out that many of you have signed up to have social media accounts. The companies that run these networks - for example, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat or WhatsApp - all have their own terms and conditions that you have to agree to before you can have an account with them. For example, they might say that you have to be a certain age to have an account, or that the company is allowed to use any pictures you post however they like. You might hear of terms and conditions being referred to as Ts and Cs. You aren't allowed to use these sites without agreeing to the terms and conditions. So many people - including adults - don't read them because they just want to get on and use the site or app. They don't think that there's any point wasting time to go through them, which means they don't know what they've agreed to. Also, the list of rules can be extremely long and complicated - and written in technical language - which can make them difficult to understand.

Current Ladbrokes chief executive, Jim Mullen, will become boss of the merged company, named Ladbrokes Coral. The two firms had announced merger talks last month. Peter Erskine, chairman of Ladbrokes, hailed the merger as a \"major strategic step for Ladbrokes\". He added: \"Together, we will create a leading betting and gaming business. The transaction will provide an attractive opportunity to generate considerable value for both sets of shareholders.\" The best way at looking at the challenges facing the merged betting giant of Ladbrokes and Coral is that they have tried to merge before. In 1998 that planned deal was squashed by Peter Mandelson, the trade and industry minister at the time, on the grounds that it would dominate the industry. Yet at that time the biggest threat to Ladbrokes and Coral did not even exist. Betfair is the world's largest internet-based betting exchange and it was not founded until 2000. It is only one of a huge number of online betting companies that pay lower tax bills, can compete for business both here and around the world and face few of the fixed costs of owning thousands of shops on the British High Street. The rationale behind this merger is to create a company that will stand a better chance of competing with those online giants. To fund the deal Ladbrokes will offer 93 million new shares to investors, representing 10% of the company. Gala Coral has been owned by a number of private equity firms, including Apollo Global Management, Cerberus Capital Management, Anchorage Capital Partners and Park Square Capital, since 2010, when it collapsed under \u00a32.5bn of debt. Under the terms of the deal, those private equity owners will own 48.25% of the new company's shares, with the remainder being held by Ladbrokes shareholders. Ladbrokes shares closed down 3.3% at 124.1p. Before the merger talks began, Gala Coral had appointed Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to advise on a possible stock market debut, initially planned for October.

Ukraine is believed to have some of the largest shale gas reserves in Europe. New technology means they are more easily recoverable, but opponents warn of a high risk of pollution. The deal between Ukraine's state company Nadra Yuzivska and Shell was signed by the energy giant's CEO Peter Voser and Ukrainian Energy Minister Eduard Stavytsky on Thursday. \"We have witnessed a great event today. I believe we have become almost relatives,\" said Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who was present at the ceremony. The 50-year production sharing deal is believed to be the biggest contract in Europe to extract natural gas trapped underground in shale rock. However, experts say that production in Ukraine is several years away and much will depend on results from test wells. Kiev is hoping that the deal would help it escape dependence on Russian natural gas. Ukraine \"might even go into surplus,\" Mr Stavytsky said.

She was speaking alongside ex-Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, who said the positive case for the EU had been missing from the campaign. But Commons leader Chris Grayling, in Caerphilly, said the Brexit case was an \"overwhelmingly positive one\". He was campaigning in the south Wales valleys for a Leave vote alongside Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, Monmouth Tory MP David Davies, and UKIP AMs Nathan Gill and Mark Reckless. The two sides have been stepping up their campaigns with just one week to go before the UK's in-out referendum on 23 June. Talking to BBC Wales in Cardiff city centre on Thursday, Mr Salmond agreed the vote was close, describing it as \"nip and tuck\". \"There's going to be a strong remain vote in Scotland as in Northern Ireland,\" he said. \"I'm hoping for a Remain vote in Wales to make it a Celtic triple, as it were. \"It's on a knife edge in England.\" Mr Salmond predicted a \"surge of European enthusiasm\" as \"you go deep into the European football championships\". \"What the campaign has been missing has been the positive aspect of Europe,\" he said. Claiming the EU had been a force for peace and prosperity, Mr Salmond urged voters not to \"jeopardise what we've built over 60 years\". Asked if she had been taken aback by the strength of the Leave campaign in Wales, Ms Wood said: \"Yes, I have.\" \"I've been quite surprised by how so many people have been able to be persuaded around this question of fear of immigration. \"We've got a week now to try to persuade as many people as possible that it is in Wales' best interests to Remain as a part of the European Union,\" she added. Earlier, Ms Wood said politicians in Wales wanting the UK to stay in the EU had failed to organise a \"proper, decent campaign\". She told BBC Radio Wales the assembly election in May had \"dominated all of us in Wales on the political scene\". \"The timing of this referendum was a bit of a disaster from a Welsh perspective,\" she said. \"It's been very difficult and challenging.\" Mr Grayling and his fellow Brexit vote campaigners gatherer around the Tommy Cooper statue in Caerphilly on Thursday, with drivers tooting their horns as they drove past. \"This is a battle between those who don't like the European Union and say we should definitely leave, and those who don't like the European Union but say 'oh well, we should stay',\" he said. \"I have to say there is little support for the EU anywhere in the United Kingdom.\" Mr Grayling added: \"I know how tough it is in parts of the valleys - I've been here many times before. \"I've seen some of the challenges in and around this area. \"I've spoken to some of the people who face the consequences of migration into this area.\" Mr Gill, UKIP Wales' leader, said that Leave had the momentum. \"There is something in the air.

{"article": "Gwynedd council is a considering charging a premium on holiday homes. Councillor Jason Humphreys, however, fears the authority will lose out as people sidestep the charge by classing their second homes as self-catering businesses. Gwynedd said it was powerless to stop owners making the change. Some Welsh councils have voted through hikes in council tax charges for second homes, including Anglesey and Pembrokeshire, with other councils still consulting on a change. Since 2006, the number of self-catering units in Gwynedd has risen from 78 to 968. Changes to the Housing (Wales) Act 2014 mean councils have the ability to charge a premium on top of the existing council tax payments for second homes from the 2017-18 financial year. But self-catering units are classed as businesses and so their owners pay business tax to the Treasury rather than council tax. According to the law, self-catering units have to be made available for letting for 140 days a year, and owners have to prove they have been let for at least 70 days. Mr Humphreys, chairman of the council's corporate scrutiny committee, told the Post Cyntaf programme there was no mechanism for monitoring the situation. He called for AMs and MPs to demand a law change to make it compulsory for anyone seeking to reclassify their holiday home as a self-catering unit to apply for planning permission. But Peredur Jenkins, cabinet member responsible for resources, said the council had no power to stop owners from designating their properties as self-catering units. The council previously warned the potential \"loophole\" could leave authorities worse off. Mr Jenkins said Gwynedd was pressing the Welsh Government to consider changing the planning regulations to give local authorities the power to determine whether owners could re-classify their properties. The Welsh Conservatives have criticised the second home tax as an unfair \"money-spinner\", with shadow local government minister Janet Finch-Saunders calling it a \"spiteful wealth tax\". She said it was a \"a direct tax on people with second homes, many of whom already pay twice for services they rarely use\".

{"article": "Tips on how to push students to sign up for expensive courses were included in records released during a class-action lawsuit against Trump University. Mr Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has denied that the school misled students. But Hillary Clinton described the venture as a \"fraudulent scheme\". Mrs Clinton, who leads to race to be the Democratic nominee, said the former school was \"used to prey upon those who could least afford it\". The now defunct for profit school is at the centre of two class-action lawsuits in San Diego, California, alleging the company scammed students by failing to deliver on promises to impart Mr Trump's secrets of real estate success. Former students say they were misled by adverts claiming Mr Trump had \"hand-picked\" teachers and \"overseen\" the curriculum. The billionaire businessman continues to maintain the majority of his customers were satisfied with the real estate programme. The documents were released following an order by US District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel. The judge ruled that the files were in the public interest since Mr Trump had become \"the front-runner in the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential race\". Trump University was launched in 2004 as a business venture under the Trump brand, offering courses in entrepreneurship. The extent of Mr Trump's involvement in the scheme is a key point on contention. The trove of documents include manuals or \"playbooks\" for employees outlining how to \"close the deal\" and convince students to invest in business seminars that cost up to nearly $35,000 (\u00c2\u00a324,288). The \"playbooks\" also advised sales staff on how to speak to reporters, how to dress and run Trump University events, as well as how to identify students with the most liquid assets. The unsealed files also included depositions from executives describing how the operation worked. They also included statements from employees describing the program a \"scam\". Former staff member Ronald Schnackenberg wrote that he left Trump University in 2007, citing the program used \"misleading, fraudulent and dishonest\" tactics. The previously unseen testimony from Trump University executives goes some way to show Mr Trump's level of involvement in the school's marketing strategy. Michael Sexton, Trump University president, said in a 2012 deposition that Mr Trump offered \"very good and substantive input\" to the program's marketing materials. The documents were released in one of two class-action lawsuits in California against Trump University. In a separate civil lawsuit in New York, Democratic Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has alleged that Trump University used deceptive practices and misled students about the support they would get. Mr Trump has denied any wrongdoing. A judge has said the $40m case in New York could proceed to trial, but Mr Trump has appealed the ruling. The San Diego case involving the released documents is expected to go to trial in late November, just weeks after the US presidential election. Mr Trump could be called to testify. But he is not the only presidential candidate marred by legal dispute.

At least 89 people were killed in the incident in rebel-held Khan Sheikhoun. Syria's government has repeatedly denied using any chemical weapons. The US has rejected the assertion, however, and on Friday it carried out a missile strike on the Shayrat airbase, where it said a Syrian Air Force jet that attacked Khan Sheikhoun with chemical weapons took off. President Bashar al-Assad's ally Russia, which says the Syrian jet had in fact hit a rebel depot full of chemical munitions, denounced the \"illegal action\" by the US. A number of casualties were treated at hospitals in Turkey, which opposes Mr Assad, following last Tuesday's incident in neighbouring Idlib province. The World Health Organization said their apparent lack of external injuries and similar symptoms, including acute respiratory distress, suggested they had been exposed to organophosphorus chemicals, a category that includes nerve agents. On Tuesday, Mr Akdag announced that a chemical known as isopropyl methyphosphonic acid (IMPA) had been \"identified in the blood and urine tests conducted on samples taken from the victims\". Once exposed to air and water, Sarin breaks down into IMPA and methylphosphonic acid (MPA). The UN concluded that rockets filled with sarin were fired at several rebel-held suburbs of Damascus in August 2013 after finding traces of IMPA in samples taken from the scene of the attack, which the US blamed on Syria's government.

Speaking alongside Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Mr Warner said that he was \"distressed\" by Mr Trump's words, and that the Republican nominee does not have respect for the military. This is the first time he has endorsed a Democrat for president. Other Republicans to have supported Mrs Clinton include Larry Pressler, a former governor and senator from South Dakota, and former Minnesota governor Arne Carlson. Wednesday's endorsement by the Arizona Republic's editorial board is the latest from a typically Republican-leaning newspaper. She has already been endorsed by the conservative-leaning newspapers such as the Dallas Morning News, the the Houston Chronicle, and the Cincinnati Enquirer. \"Since The Arizona Republic began publication in 1890, we have never endorsed a Democrat over a Republican for president. Never. This reflects a deep philosophical appreciation for conservative ideals and Republican principles. This year is different. The 2016 Republican candidate is not conservative and he is not qualified,\" the editorial in the Republic, the state's largest, says.

{"article": "The plan to restrict the promotion of foods high in fat, salt and sugar to under 16s is being consulted on by the Committee of Advertising Practice. It would see the existing ban on TV ads extended to all media, including online outlets, the industry regulator said. Current limits on using celebrities and characters to sell food to children could be relaxed for healthier foods. About one in five children in the England is classed as obese by the end of primary school, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre. The self-regulatory body, CAP, which sets rules for UK advertising, said the new rules could make a \"meaningful contribution to tackling this important health issue\". Currently, food and drink deemed unhealthy can be advertised to children in non-broadcast media, unlike television where strict regulation prohibits it through content and scheduling restrictions. Ofcom research suggests that 96% of 12 to 15-year-olds spent more time online than watching TV last year. The advertising industry needed to make sure its regulations reflected changing media habits among young people, CAP said. Evidence showed advertising had a \"modest\" effect on children's food preferences, it said. However, factors such as parental influence, opportunities for physical exercise and education playing a greater role in solutions to childhood obesity, it argued. Chairman James Best said: \"Advertising is just one small factor in a very complex equation but we believe we can play a positive part in addressing an urgent societal challenge. \"In proposing new rules, our aim is to strike the right balance between protecting children and enabling businesses to continue advertising their products responsibly.\" Alex Neill, of consumer watchdog Which?, said a rule change was \"long overdue\", and vital to tackling childhood obesity. But Children's Food Campaign co-ordinator Malcolm Clark said the proposals had \"too many gaps in the detail of the consultation and scope for the rules to be weakened\". The regulator had \"missed obvious opportunities to make the UK a world leader in putting the protection of children's health above food and advertising industry profits,\" he said.

{"article": "A win over Motherwell was not enough and Foran, who wants to stay on as manager, felt let down by some players. The manager made reference to \"two or three bad apples in the dressing room\". And he added: \"I probably should have got rid of them in January. I stayed loyal to a lot of players and some of them didn't pay me back.\" Inverness won three of their last four Premiership matches as they fought to finish in the play-off spot. But Hamilton Accies' 4-0 hammering of Dundee on Saturday ensured they will face Dundee United for a spot in the Premiership next term, while Inverness will play Championship football despite their 3-2 win over Well. \"It's obviously disappointment,\" Foran added. \"The best clubs in the world get knocked down, it's how you rebuild and come back. I've told the players there are far worse off people in life. \"But it happens in football. It is not all rosy. It is not all about winning all the time. I've been part of relegation teams - you stay loyal, you rebuild. You get knocked down, you get back up again. \"You need to get rid of the two or three players you don't want, that haven't given 100%, and I look forward to getting rid of those three. \"Of the starting 11 today, I would hope to have at least 10 of those for next season [midfielder Greg Tansey is leaving to join Aberdeen]. I am very proud of the players and when we got the right team playing, we could finish well, with guys giving their all for the club.\" Foran, who was a player at the time, stayed with Inverness when they were relegated from the top flight in 2009. One year into a four-year contract, he hopes to do the same as manager. \"I want to be here next season,\" he said. \"I will have a chat with the board probably on Monday or Tuesday and will find out what their thoughts are. But I am 100% behind this club and I expect to be here next season. \"There are changes to be made, on and off the field. Personally I want a smaller squad. \"I have got to look at myself as well. I haven't performed well enough. I have learned a heck of a lot this season - about myself, about players, the trust of people around you, and people you don't trust. \"One of my favourite seasons as a player was getting promoted, because we stuck together.

The previous highest chase by England at Lord's is 282-3 against New Zealand in 2004, meaning Alastair Cook's men are likely to face a record target. Asad Shafiq (49) and Sarfraz Ahmed (45) batted Pakistan into a strong position. England bowled well - Chris Woakes taking another five-wicket haul - but dropped two catches late in the day. Stuart Broad spilled a difficult chance to dismiss Yasir Shah (30 not out) at mid-off and then wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow dropped what was more of a regulation catch to end a punchy innings from strokemaker Sarfraz. They may also rue the moment Younus Khan, who put on 69 with Shafiq for the fifth wicket, had a leg-before dismissal reversed following a review with the score at 75-4 and Pakistan's lead just 142. Media playback is not supported on this device . Woakes was head and shoulders above the rest of his team-mates with the ball. The Warwickshire all-rounder started the day hoping to push England closer to Pakistan's first innings total of 339 all out. However, he was let down by his batting partners as England's last three wickets fell for 19 runs - leaving Woakes unbeaten on a well-constructed 35. He then shone with the ball, recording what are currently the second-best match figures (11-101) by an England bowler this decade. His expert line and length, which is delivered at a livelier pace than when he made his debut in 2013, saw him snare opener Shan Masood via a catch at first slip and helped him to pin Azhar Ali in front. He returned later in the day to bowl the obdurate Asad Shafiq for 49 and have both Sarfraz and Wahab Riaz caught behind with an outswinger and attempted bouncer respectively. England's batsman were bamboozled by the leg-spin of Yasir Shah in their first innings, with Steven Finn becoming the 30-year-old's sixth victim on a frenetic third morning. The odd delivery is beginning to stay low, while Woakes showed the benefit of a lively line and length on a sporting surface. History is also stacked against Alastair Cook's side. Their highest chase at Lord's is the 282-3 they scored against New Zealand in 2004, with the ground's highest successful fourth-innings total being the 344-1 hit by West Indies in 1984.

This explained why she leaked urine every day.

She said part of the problem is convincing people that there is something wrong. The 51-year-old said she has been told by specialists not to be frightened of her pain and to try to live and work through it.

I have had pain right down my legs. My hip often gives way when I am walking,\" she said . Susan said she wants the mesh removed. Sitting close by is 58-year-old Yvonne McIntosh. She had vaginal mesh inserted four years ago to try and fix incontinence. While it was a success at the start, she said it now feels like it is starting to unravel inside her body. \"I have been having excruciating pain. I have felt something within me is coming out and would have to go into the bathroom to push it up,\" she said. \"My husband could also feel it when we were being intimate - he said he could feel something sharp.\" A mother of three, Yvonne said it feels like it is making its way out of her body and coming through her groin.

About 140 officers from Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and two other units swooped on properties linked to the men on Wednesday. It is thought the gang bought the goods with money from the robberies. Police seized an Audi A5, a pick-up truck, a caravan, quad bikes and heavy machinery including diggers from properties in Wisbech in Cambridgeshire, Potton in Bedfordshire and Upwell in Norfolk. Cannabis factories, with a combined street value between \u00a318,000 and \u00a354,000, were also discovered at the Potton and Upwell properties. Police said the properties were connected to Joseph Upton, John Smith and Albert Smith. Along with John Christopher Smith and Alfred Stanley, they were sentenced to 22 years for carrying out ram-raids at 12 banks in 2012 across Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, Norfolk and Suffolk. They stole more than \u00a3300,000 from cash machines and cars and jewellery more than \u00a3100,000 during burglaries. Damage caused in the ram-raids was estimated at costing about \u00a3250,000 to repair. The courts will eventually decide what goods the gang accumulated from their wrong-doing and if they should be confiscated.

Loyalist protests followed Belfast City Council's vote last December to limit the flying of the union flag from city hall. Some of the demonstrations resulted in violence. On Saturday, Mr Doran told the conference in Lurgan, County Armagh, what had been opposed had been a \"democratic decision\" of Belfast City Council. Mr Doran told about 140 delegates that nationalists and unionists often viewed each other with \"mutual incomprehension\" even though they had a lot in common. He said loyalists could learn from organisations like the Gaelic Athletic Association, when it came to issues like community pride and reaching out. Progressive Unionist Party councillor John Kyle said loyalists had to do \"more than\" protest; he said they also had to come up with ways out of problems that arose. He said the party would not give \"cover or excuse\" to criminality.

{"article": "Ingram made 101 not out off 47 balls and, although Wright later matched his score, Glamorgan won by 18 runs. Colin Ackermann hit a six off the final ball as Leicestershire edged out Lancashire in a thrilling finish. Surrey beat Somerset despite a 12-run over-rate penalty and there were also wins for holders Northants and Kent. A total of 66 sixes were struck in Sunday's five games, 19 of them in the Sussex v Glamorgan game. While South Africa's Test team crashed to a 211-run defeat against England at Lord's, it was a good day for some of their compatriots on the county circuit - especially those playing for Glamorgan. Chief among them was Ingram, who hit seven sixes to rescue his side from 7-2. He added 130 with former Proteas batsman Jacques Rudolph (49) and then 70 off the final six overs with Johannesburg-born Chris Cooke (37 not out) as they posted 198-3. When it was Glamorgan's turn to field, Ingram weighed in with the wickets of Ross Taylor and Ben Brown. And although Wright equalled Ingram's sixes tally in his 101 off 53 balls, he fell to another South African, Marchant de Lange, in the penultimate over as they came up short on 180-6. At Aigburth, Liam Livingstone (48 off 34 balls) and Jos Buttler (39 off 21) were the main contributors to Lancashire Lightning's 173-9. Leicestershire looked comfortable needing only six off the final over, but Mathew Pillans was run out after four singles to start the over. Ackermann was on strike for the final ball from Kyle Jarvis and managed to clear the rope at deep extra cover to finish with an unbeaten 62 off 41 balls as they won by three wickets. \"In T20 cricket you have to come in with good intent, to hit the ball and to run hard,\" he told BBC Radio Leicester. Somerset looked dead and buried against Surrey at The Oval as they were reduced to 82-7 after Arran Finch's 61 off 42 balls led the home side to 181-7. But Surrey had reckoned without New Zealander Corey Anderson, who raced to a 30-ball half-century - and a decision by the umpires to award 12 penalty runs to the visitors because of their poor over-rate. Somerset needed 12 to win off the last over, but Anderson was run out for 81 - and innings featuring seven sixes - and Surrey scraped home by four runs. \"They said we were tight, but I certainly was trying to do everything I could (to keep the rate up),\" Surrey skipper Jade Dernbach told BBC Radio London. \"The other night, being on TV, there seemed to be a different kind of timekeeping taking place compared to this game. I'd like to see some consistency from a captain's point of view, so we know we're at. But we still got over the line and that's the most important thing.\" Essex import Mohammed Amir came in for some rough treatment from the Kent batsmen at Beckenham, with Joe Denly hitting three sixes and a four in his second over as they tried to defend a score of 166-8. Denly (32) and Sam Northeast (33) were removed by spinner Simon Harmer (2-21), but unlike the final over of the Essex innings in which three wickets fell, Kent opener Daniel Bell-Drummond saw his side home with a six off Amir, whose 3.3 overs cost 41 runs. Bell-Drummond was 90 not out as Kent reached 169-3 with nine balls to spare, having struck four sixes and eight fours. At Chester-le-Street, South Africans Rory Kleinveldt (3-28) and Tabraiz Shamsi (2-20) helped Northants restrict Durham Jets to 161-7, despite an unbeaten 53 by Jack Burnham.

Judge Charles Gratwicke described it as \"a brutal and sick, callous killing\". Jordan Taylor, 22, of Basildon, must serve a minimum of 23 years in jail for murdering Miss Davies just moments after she had ended their relationship. Follow live updates on this story and other Essex news . Taylor had denied murder but was found guilty by a jury at Chelmsford Crown Court on Thursday. Sentencing him to life in prison, Judge Gratwicke told Taylor: \"The jury saw through your lies, and saw you for what you are - a devious, jealous and ruthless individual prepared to unleash extreme violence on anyone who crosses your path. \"This was a brutal and sick, callous killing.\" During the eight-day trial the court heard Taylor and Miss Davies had been together since December 2014. He had moved into the flat which came with her job as a groom at the sanctuary. Miss Davies had told friends she planned to end the relationship on the evening of 3 July last year - the night she was murdered. The kitchen knife Taylor turned on Miss Davies had been used with such force it was bent to a 45-degree angle. The court heard Taylor claimed he stabbed her twice in self-defence after she attacked him. Things went \"foggy\" after that, he said. He said he could not remember most of the attack and denied murdering Miss Davies. However, the Crown Prosecution Service described it as a \"vicious and sustained attack\" carried out by Taylor while he was in a \"jealous rage\" after Miss Davies ended the relationship. Prosecutors said the attack on Miss Davies began in the flat in Pitsea Hall Lane, then continued outside as she fled in her pyjamas. Taylor had denied initially making \"disfiguring\" cuts to Miss Davies' face and left breast as \"punishment\" for trying to end the relationship, before eventually going on to kill her. CCTV footage showed Taylor attempting to hoist Miss Davies' near-lifeless body over a hedge out of view. He was found by police crouching in bushes near her body. Miss Davies died later that night in Basildon Hospital. Taylor was charged with her murder. The jury heard Taylor, a martial arts enthusiast, had tried to control a number of aspects of Miss Davies' life. Her mother Dyanne Lambert told the court he would not allow her daughter to wear short-sleeved or low-cut tops and the couple would often argue. \"She became very quiet and didn't want to talk about what was going on,\" she said. Speaking after Taylor was sentenced, Mrs Lambert said: \"Obviously nothing will bring our Laura back but we are glad that he will be off the streets for a very long time. \"Twenty-three years is long, but it will not bring our baby back.\" Miss Davies' father, John Davies, said: \"We've lost Laura forever and it's very hard to deal with. \"We thank the justice system for all their work and for the sentence, but we repeat, it still never brings our beautiful Laura back.\" Judge Gratwicke told Taylor his \"wicked actions\" had \"totally devastated the family\". \"This was an appalling killing and you have shown not a shred of remorse through the trial for your actions,\" he said.", "abstract": "A man who murdered his girlfriend by stabbing her 80 times in a \"jealous rage\" has been jailed for life.", "candidate": "A \"devious, jealous and ruthless\" man has been jailed for life for stabbing his girlfriend to death.", "doc_id": 1317, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "The jury saw through your lies, and saw you for what you are - a devious, jealous and ruthless individual prepared to unleash extreme violence on anyone who crosses your path.", "explanation": "all the summary statements about the vicious crime are supported by the source text.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}
{"article": "Civil Aviation Authority data suggested there were 83 incidents at the airport in 2016, up from 44 the previous year. The British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) said the rate of attacks was dangerously high and could soon result in a serious incident. It has called for new police powers to help prevent attacks from taking place. The rate of attacks, in relation to the number of flights taking off or landing at Glasgow Airport, was \"significantly high\". There were 98,127 flights to and from Glasgow last year compared to 474,963 at Heathrow Airport, where there were 151 laser attacks. Birmingham and Manchester also continued to experience high numbers of attacks. Incidents at Edinburgh Airport dropped from 55 to 44 from 2015 to 2016. Across the UK, 1,258 laser attacks were reported in 2016, down from 1,439 the year before, which equates to more than three incidents a day on average. Balpa flight safety specialist Steve Landells said: \"We are concerned that at more than three reports a day this figure is still dangerously high. \"We're also concerned that under-reporting of incidents could mean that we don't have a true idea of the scale of the problem.\" He welcomed the new Vehicle Technology and Aviation Bill, which proposes to increase the powers of the courts to allow them to impose prison sentences for laser attacks. He said: \"Balpa wants to see these people stopped before they commit this reckless act and we hope that the bill will give police and authorities the powers to ensure they don't happen in the first place.\" The UK government's transport secretary Chris Grayling said shining a laser pointer at pilots was \"incredibly dangerous and could have fatal consequences\" He added: \"Whilst we know laser pens can be fun and many users have good intentions, some are not aware of the risks of dazzling drivers or pilots putting public safety at risk. \"That's why we want to take the common sense approach to strengthen our laws to protect the public from those who are unaware of the dangers or, even worse, intentionally want to cause harm.

The teenager who died in a water-filled quarry in County Tyrone is the third member of his extended family to die in a drowning tragedy. The body of Rhys Jack was recovered from the disused quarry in the Backtown area of Strabane on Tuesday afternoon. Parish priest, Father Michael Doherty, said both of the teenager's parents had lost family members through drowning. His mother lost her five-year-old brother about 40 years ago, while his father's uncle drowned in recent years. Father Doherty has been with members of the Jack family since the tragedy began to unfold on Monday evening. The 17-year-old was in the quarry with three teenage friends when they fell into the water from a makeshift raft. His three friends, who were later rescued, had frantically tried to save him. Father Doherty told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme that Rhys's parents, Elaine and Mark, identified his body at the quarry shortly after it was recovered by search teams. He said: \"They knew over the past day, or from about eight o'clock last night (20:00 BST) that although they would have liked to have thought there was a chance he would be still alive, they knew that he was gone and their hope was that the body would be found sooner rather than later.\" The priest said that their \"deep sadness\" at losing their son was mixed with \"relief\". He explained that the corpse of Elaine Jack's young brother had never been found, so they were relieved that Rhys's body had been recovered. He also said it was his understanding that Mark Jack's uncle had drowned in the River Finn a number of years ago. Father Doherty was the Jack family's parish priest and had baptised Rhys 17 years ago. He was also a chaplain at the teenager's school.

{"article": "The rebel, known as Roman Ruiz, led the 18th division of the Farc, which operates in north-west Colombia. The bombing was the latest in a series of attacks on the Farc by Colombian security forces. The two sides are holding peace talks but have not agreed a ceasefire. The Colombian air force said it bombed a rebel position near the town of Riosucio in north-western Choco province on Monday. Sources in the security forces later told local media that among those killed in the raid was Alfredo Alarcon Machado, better known by his alias, Roman Ruiz. However, Ruiz has been reported killed once before. Last year, sources in the security forces announced he had been killed, only for the head of the police to deny it later. Ruiz is believed to be the right-hand man of Pastor Alape, who is part of the Farc team negotiating with the Colombian government at peace talks in the Cuban capital, Havana. About 40 Farc rebels have been killed since the security forces resumed their bombing raids. President Juan Manuel Santos gave the order for the resumption after 11 soldiers were killed on 15 April in a Farc ambush in south-western Cauca province. The attack on the soldiers caused outrage in Colombia, with many questioning the rebels' commitment to the peace talks. The Farc had declared a unilateral ceasefire in December as a sign of its commitment to the talks. It argued the ambush in Cauca had been a \"defensive measure\" taken by its rebels as they came under pressure from the security forces. When the peace talks officially began in November 2012, President Juan Manuel Santos ruled out a ceasefire, arguing that the guerrilla had used them during previous negotiations to re-group and re-arm. In March of this year, he did however order the suspension of bombing raids. The peace talks have been going on for two and a half years during which the two sides have so far reached agreement on three topics on their five-point agenda. An estimated 220,000 people have died in a half century of armed conflict in Colombia. November 2012 - Formal peace talks begin in the Cuban capital Havana between the Colombian government and the Farc. May 2013 - A deal is reached on land reform, one of the most contentious issues. It calls for fair access to land, and rural development, two key causes of the conflict. November 2013 - The two sides agree on the political participation of the Farc should a peace deal be reached. May 2014 - Both parties pledge to eliminate all illicit drug production in Colombia. December 2014 - Farc declares a unilateral ceasefire. March 2015 - Both sides agree to work together to remove landmines. Colombia is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world.

Many customers found their debit cards were declined and about 3,500 ATMs were not working for three hours. The technical fault has now been fixed, and the banking group has apologised to those affected. The hardware failure came on a normal day for the banking group, it said. \"We were in 'business as usual' mode - and there was no maintenance or update activity on the system at the time,\" said a spokeswoman for Lloyds. By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter, BBC News . This is not the first bank to suffer from a computer failure, and it certainly won't be the last. New technology will put even more strain on the banks' creaking IT systems, which were built to run a very different banking system decades ago. So how do we cope as consumers? The irony is that the more we embrace the digital wallet, the more emergency cash we may need to carry for when these systems crash. \"We are working with our suppliers to understand what caused the hardware failure, but there is no evidence that it was as a result of an external intervention or attack on our systems. \"We continually review and update our systems as necessary and make significant investment to do this.\" The chief executive of TSB, Paul Pester, said on Sunday that its customers' debit card transactions had been affected after problems with two out of seven IT servers. He tweeted an apology and replied to some comments personally. Lloyds Banking Group serves about 30 million customers and is the largest retail banking group in the UK. TSB has about five million UK customers and is in the process of being split from Lloyds Banking Group. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the City watchdog, said it had been in contact with Lloyds and would be updated on how customers had been affected. Not everyone who tried to use their cards suffered problems, and Lloyds said that online customers were unaffected. UK banks have suffered a series of IT problems over the past few years. In December, an estimated 750,000 customers at the Royal Bank of Scotland group were unable to use their credit and debit cards for several hours. Leanne Seaward, 29, from Verwood in Dorset, said she discovered she had problems when she went to pay for her weekly supermarket shop at about 16.15 GMT on Sunday. \"It was a little embarrassing, I put my card in and it kept saying transaction void. I thought it was because I am in the process of switching banks, so assumed they might have closed my account without telling me. \"Luckily I had my husband with me so he was able to pay, but if I was getting petrol and on my own it could have been a completely different matter.\" Your experiences . A week later, NatWest - which is part of the group - said that it was hit by a cyber attack. A deliberate attempt to disrupt services by creating a surge in traffic - known as a distributed denial of service attack - meant some customers struggled to access online banking. In 2012, a major IT failure locked many RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank customers out of their accounts for several days. The issue was particularly bad for Ulster Bank, with customers facing access problems for weeks. Most banks have seen online and card failures in recent years, with many of the computer systems being used dating back decades. TechUK, a trade body for a number of technology companies, said: \"It is now widely acknowledged that the technology infrastructure across many financial institutions is exceptionally complex, to the point where it no longer serves many banks, it hinders them. \"However many financial institutions are unable to address these issues because of the sheer cost and disruption that replacing these systems would entail.\"", "abstract": "A hardware failure was the cause of the shutdown of some Halifax, Lloyds, Bank of Scotland and TSB cash machines and debit cards on Sunday.", "candidate": "Thousands of customers of Lloyds and TSB were unable to use their debit and credit cards on Sunday.", "doc_id": 3345, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "Customers of Lloyds Banking Group were unable to use their debit cards or ATM machines for a short period.", "evidence": "Many customers found their debit cards were declined and about 3,500 ATMs were not working for three hours.", "explanation": "Does not say how many customers of Lloyds, and only mentions TSB in the past.

Next year's festival will take place from 21 to 25 June, with the first batch of tickets, for those buying coach packages, released on 6 October. General tickets will be released three days later, at 09:00 BST on 9 October. Last year's initial release of 120,000 tickets sold out in just over half an hour. The highlight of the music calendar, this summer Glastonbury featured performances from headliners Adele, Coldplay and Muse, who rocked the Pyramid stage, festooned with a giant lightning bolt in honour of David Bowie.

{"article": "Researchers from Boston Children's Hospital in Massachusetts found a doubling in the odds of obesity by the time the child was three years old. The team said birth by C-section might affect bacteria in the gut, which in turn affects the way food is digested. The study looked at 1,255 pairs of mothers and children from 1999 to 2002. The mothers joined the study - published in the Archives of Disease in Childhood - before 22 weeks of pregnancy. Their babies were measured and weighed at birth and this was repeated at the age of three. About one in four of the deliveries were C-section births and the remainder were vaginal deliveries. The team found a link between body mass, skin thickness and how a child was born. They also found that mothers who delivered by C-section tended to weigh more than those delivering traditionally - something which is known to influence obesity. But the researchers said another possible explanation was the difference in the composition of gut bacteria acquired at birth between the two delivery methods. They suggested expectant mothers who choose a C-section should be made aware of the obesity risk to their babies. In the UK just over 23% of births are Caesarean.

People have been protesting since Sunday over President Pierre Nkurunziza's decision to stand for re-election in June. African news at it happens: 1 May 2015 . The government closed the university on Thursday citing \"insecurity\". Earlier on Thursday several hundred students tried to organise a march into the centre of Bujumbura. They wanted to stop the president from officially presenting his nomination papers to the electoral commission. The students told the BBC's Maud Jullien that the US embassy was the only place they felt safe and that they feared security forces were pursuing them. She estimates around 500 students are outside the embassy. The US has not reacted to their presence. Senior US diplomat Tom Malinowski met Mr Nkurunziza on Thursday, and afterwards said he had warned that the situation in Burundi was \"dangerous\". \"Some of the measures that have been taken... to shut down social media, to suspend radio stations not only are wrong as a matter of principle but very counter-productive,\" he told journalists. Rupert Colville from the UN human rights office also said on Friday that he was \"deeply concerned\" about the authorities' curtailing people's freedom of speech. At least seven people have died amid the biggest protests Burundi has seen since the civil war ended in 2005.

{"article": "A pregnant traveller, 18, said she was put in a ward on her own and not allowed visitors, as \"she was a Gypsy\". It was one account uncovered in a study into Gypsy and travellers' experiences of the Welsh NHS. Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said there were \"real challenges\" and more needed to be done. Chairwoman of the assembly's Gypsy and Traveller Committee Labour AM Julie Morgan said the discrimination was an \"absolute disgrace\". According to the last official count over 900 Gypsy and traveller families live in caravans across Wales, with 35% living on sites in Cardiff and Pembrokeshire alone. In what is thought to be the first survey of its kind in Europe, about 100 Gypsies and travellers were interviewed by community champions as part of the study, between April 2016 and March 2017. Travellers spoke of difficulties accessing GP services, claiming they faced discrimination from receptionists and barriers filling in registration forms as many are illiterate. A distrust of dentists also led to children saying they had needed to have between 10 and 20 rotten teeth removed. Report author Dr Adrian Marsh said while some GPs gave travellers prescriptions for during the summer period, when they travel to festivals and cultural events, others did not. He said large numbers of visitors descending on hospital wards during visiting hours often created tensions and lead to conflict. Some evidence of good practice especially in north Wales were also highlighted in the report. Speaking at the report's launch at the Pierhead in Cardiff Mrs Morgan said the experiences of the community were often \"very negative\" and people were nervous of seeking help. She said she hoped the report could be a blueprint for improving services for a community which was \"one of the most stigmatised\" in Wales. \"It's very shocking to hear some of the ways people have been treated in the health service,\" she said. \"There have been very good examples, very good relationships with district nurses, with GPs, but also a lot of stories of discrimination; difficulties getting access to the health service, ways people had been treated, stigma, and this really illustrates it, and it is really something we have got to tackle.\" Mr Gething said the Welsh Government was working in partnership with health boards to improve access to NHS services for communities. \"I know we are not a perfect country but I do think we are doing the right thing to make sure there is equality,\" he said.", "abstract": "Gypsies and travellers are facing barriers to accessing health care in Wales due to discrimination, a report suggests.", "candidate": "Gypsies and travellers in Wales face discrimination in the health service, a report has found.", "doc_id": 3015, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "It was one account uncovered in a study into Gypsy and travellers' experiences of the Welsh NHS.", "explanation": "it correctly pulls the info (gypsies, travelers, Wales, discrimination, health services) from the source text", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

{"article": "In the 1960s and 70s, the spirits of scores of convicted Japanese war criminals were \"enshrined\" there. The most controversial were the 14 \"Class A\" war criminals, including wartime leader Hideki Tojo, who were \"enshrined\" in the late 1970s. These men were the ones who ordered and oversaw Japan's brutal war in China and South East Asia. Yasukuni Shrine . It was a war in which millions died, in which there were widespread massacres of civilians, in which rape was routinely used as a weapon and where Japan used chemical and biological warfare against civilians. So if the shrine is so offensive to China and South Korea why did Mr Abe go? Firstly, because he wanted to. Close observers of the Japanese prime minister say he is at heart a nationalist and a historical revisionist. He believes the trials that convicted Japan's wartime leaders were \"victors' justice\". His own grandfather Nobusuke Kishi served in the war cabinet and was arrested by the Americans on suspicion of being a Class A war criminal. He was later released without charge. But the stain of association with Japan's war crimes in China never completely went away. Secondly, Mr Abe's support base comes from the right wing of the Liberal Democratic Party. According to Professor Jeff Kingston of Temple University in Tokyo, Mr Abe is \"showing he is a tough guy\", that he is not afraid of China. It is something that plays very well to his base. But there is perhaps a bigger goal that Mr Abe has in mind. He wants to radically revise Japan's post-war constitution. This, too, is a long-held dream that started with his grandfather in the 1950s. Mr Abe believes he is the man to complete the historic task of getting rid of the hated \"peace constitution\". Like many on the right here, Mr Abe believes that constitution was forced on Japan by America and is a humiliation. It imposes not only pacifism, but also Western notions of human rights and civil liberties. It rejects Japan's uniqueness in favour of \"universal values\". Mr Abe would like to change a lot of this. But it will be very hard. And so he will need some help. \"Abe has provoked China, and China has reacted just as Abe wanted it to,\" says Prof Kingston. \"There is a shrewd political calculus at work here.\" What he means is that having an external threat in the shape of big and frightening China may be just what Mr Abe wants to help push through his controversial nationalist agenda at home.", "abstract": "Whatever Shinzo Abe says, any visit to the Yasakuni shrine by a Japanese prime minister is deeply political and sure to cause offence.", "candidate": "Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo.", "doc_id": 1420, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has visited the Yasukuni Shrine.", "evidence": "So if the shrine is so offensive to China and South Korea why did Mr Abe go?", "explanation": "the original summary is mostly correct, but it states the shrine is in Tokyo and this is incorrect because the source text does not contain this fact.", "instruction": "Remove the information about the shrine being in Tokyo from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about the shrine being in Tokyo from the summary."]}}

He submitted his handwritten lyrics by post and, although the contest was online-only, the organisers were so moved they put the words to music. Oh Sweet Lorraine is number seven on US iTunes and has 1.9m YouTube views. Billboard magazine said the song had sold 6,000 copies so far, placing it at number 49 in its rock digital songs sales chart. The track is also in the iTunes charts for Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Sweden, Norway and Luxembourg. \"Oh sweet Lorraine,\" the chorus begins, \"I wish we could do all the good times over again.\" Stobaugh does not perform the song himself - on his original submission, he wrote: \"I don't sing, I would scare people, haha!\" Vocals are provided instead by Jacob Colgan, whose Green Shoe Studio organised the original contest. A documentary about the recording of the song, uploaded to YouTube in July, explains how the recording came about. \"What made Fred's entry so special to us was, one, it's an online contest. People are supposed to upload their videos,\" Colgan says in the clip. \"But, instead of a video, we received a very large manila envelope. Well, I was excited to see what it was. Lo and behold, it was a letter from a 96-year-old man who said, 'I've written a song for my wife'. \"He sounds like a sweet guy,\" he continues, \"but, as I'm reading through the letter, I begin to realise that his wife had just passed away a month earlier.\" Stobaugh says the song, his first, came to him out of the blue. \"After she passed away, I was just sitting in the front room one evening by myself\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6it just [came] to me.

The city of Wuhan has been placed on red alert for heavy rainfall, after torrential downpours left parts of the city submerged and some state media estimates suggest flooding has killed more than 180 across China. This young man is reported to be a student at Wuhan University and was said to be studying for exams when water started coming into his room.

It was 1997 when 12-year-old Mark Baker began his campaign to safeguard the building's future. Since then he and volunteers have saved sections and signed a lease to look after a large part of the grounds. Gwrych Castle was built between 1812 and 1822 by Lloyd Hesketh Bamford-Hesketh as a memorial to his mother's ancestors, the Lloyds of Gwrych. By 1989 it was sold to an American and although there were plans for its future, it began to fall into decline. Travellers moved onto the site for two years before finally being forced to leave in 1997. Mark Baker, now Dr Baker, an architectural historian, said he felt compelled to try to save it after walking by it daily on his way to school. His campaign to set up Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust attracted the attention of the local newspapers and won support of community leaders. Today, the registered charity has a 25-year lease for five acres (two hectares) of the site. This has enabled it to begin restoration of the first section of the castle, the Countess's Writing Room in the Gardener's Tower. Although the formal gardens are regularly opened, from this month visitors can explore the grounds themselves for the first time. Dr Baker said public access had always been his \"main aim\".

{"article": "Mr Jammeh has denied similar allegations in the past. He will be seeking re-election for a fifth term and for the first time he will be facing a single major opposition candidate. HRW urges external pressure on The Gambia to prevent further violence. In a report published on Wednesday, the group says two Gambian activists have died in custody, with dozens of critics of President Jammeh in jail. They are being denied medical or legal help, the report says. The Gambia, a popular tourist destination because of its beaches, has never experienced a democratic transition of power since independence. Mr Jammeh took over in a 1994 coup. His critics accuse him of running a repressive state, an allegation he denies. Most of the major Gambian opposition parties last week picked a single candidate - businessman Adama Barrow of the United Democratic Party (UDP). Mr Barrow's nomination is the result of the biggest opposition alliance in Gambia since independence, the AFP news agency reported. HRW says the prospect of political change in December has prompted Mr Jammeh's government to step up oppression against critics. It claims a torture squad, linked to the presidential guard, is terrorising opponents ahead of the election. The group wants freedom benchmarks to be imposed now - by the United States, the European Union and The Gambia's West African neighbours - to prevent more bloodshed.

{"article": "The hosts went ahead after 14 seconds when a poor Hugo Lloris clearance led to Jesus Navas brilliantly chipping in. Alvaro Negredo's shot went in off Sandro and Sergio Aguero turned in a cross to put City 3-0 up at half-time. Media playback is not supported on this device . Aguero again slotted in before Negredo's 18-yard strike and a side-footed Navas shot completed the rout. City have struggled on their travels this season but at home they have been an irresistible force and they were once again in sublime form at Etihad Stadium, where they have a 100% record in the present campaign with six wins from as many games. The movement and ruthlessness of Aguero, the invention of Samir Nasri, the midfield power of Yaya Toure and pace of Navas was too much for a shell-shocked Spurs as they suffered their biggest league defeat since losing 7-1 to Newcastle in December 1996. The defeat left Tottenham with just one point from their last three top-flight outings and the drop in form has put them ninth in the Premier League. Spurs had only conceded one league goal on the road this season - and six in total - but any hope they may have had before the game evaporated after just 14 seconds. \"Tottenham have taken a hammering from a Manchester City side who have achieved an emphatic win with an exhilarating performance. City have won six out of six in the Premier League this season and scored 26 goals in the process. They were brilliant from the start.\" Lloris sent a clearance straight to Aguero and, even though the Tottenham keeper parried the Argentine's resulting 22-yard shot, he was beaten when Navas got to the loose ball ahead of Younes Kaboul and brilliantly scored with a first-time chip. The visitors tried to respond and City centre-back Martin Demichelis cleared an Erik Lamela shot off his goal-line after keeper Costel Pantilimon had missed a low Kyle Walker cross. However, that was as good as it got for Tottenham as City stunned their rivals. Aguero latched on to a Nasri cross and, despite Lloris getting a hand to the striker's chipped shot, the ball fell to Negredo, whose shot rebounded off Kaboul and Sandro on the way into the net. City right-back Pablo Zabaleta then released Navas on the right flank and the Spaniard's inviting low cross was expertly turned in from Aguero as the hosts all-but wrapped up the game before half-time. Media playback is not supported on this device . Pellegrini's side continued to dominate after the break and Toure played a one-two with Negredo before surging into the Tottenham box and squaring for Aguero to slot in his 14th goal in 11 games for the club this season. A Nasri effort came back off the crossbar before the quality of Negredo's finish for City's fifth then epitomised the home side's confidence. The Spain forward produced a drag back from Fernandinho's through ball to leave defender Michael Dawson trailing before rifling a shot past Lloris from the edge of the box. Pantilimon had to save an angled shot from recalled Spurs striker Emmanuel Adebayor but it was a rare chance for the visitors, whose misery was compounded when Navas raced clear and slotted in a sixth for City.

{"article": "Dr Balshaw will become the first female director in the Tate's 120-year history and will replace Sir Nicholas Serota, who has been at the helm since 1988. She will take charge of the Tate Modern and Tate Britain in London as well as offshoots in Liverpool and St Ives. Under her stewardship, the Whitworth had an award-winning expansion in 2015. She also runs Manchester Art Gallery. Dr Balshaw said she will focus on developing the organisation's reputation as \"artistically adventurous\". She added: \"I am tremendously excited to be leading Tate in the next chapter of its life. I look forward to developing Tate's reputation as the most artistically adventurous and culturally inclusive gallery in the world.\" Balshaw, whose appointment was approved by Prime Minister Theresa May, is the gallery's ninth director and will take up her new post on 1 June. Lord Browne, chairman of the trustees of Tate, said: \"The Trustees and I know that Maria has the vision, drive and stature to lead Tate into its next phase of development. We enthusiastically look forward to working with her as she does so.\" An ambitious, charismatic and indefatigable operator who is admired by artists and administrators alike, Dr Balshaw has been one of the key movers in Manchester's cultural renaissance over the past decade. She took over the Whitworth in 2006 then took on the main civic gallery, Manchester Art Gallery, in 2011. They have been good training for Tate - you could say the contemporary Whitworth is the Tate Modern of Manchester, while the more traditional Manchester Art Gallery is the equivalent of Tate Britain. She has been Manchester City Council's cultural leader, is on the Arts Council England board and was made a CBE in 2015. She proved her vision and leadership with the \u00c2\u00a315m redevelopment of the Whitworth, which was named museum of the year by The Art Fund in 2015. She also helped persuade then Chancellor George Osborne to include a \u00c2\u00a3110m arts venue, The Factory, in his Northern Powerhouse plans. But she is equally at home with the world's leading artists - she has forged strong relationships with the likes of Gerhard Richter, Marina Abramovic and Cornelia Parker. Her Whitworth exhibitions have shown a passion for work from all corners of the globe, from the excellent current Warhol show to the art of her beloved West Africa, and work that brings her rooms to life - stimulating, not static. Which sums her up pretty well. She has big shoes to fill. During his 29 years in charge, Sir Nicholas has built up the Tate to be one of the world's most successful art brands. Tate Modern alone gets 4.5 million visitors per year and has just opened a \u00c2\u00a3260m new extension. Tate St Ives is currently closed for renovation and will reopen in March. When he announced his departure, Sir Nicholas set a challenge to his successor, saying Tate still has \"the potential to reach broad audiences across the UK and abroad, through its own programmes, partnerships and online\". Sir Nicholas will now become chairman of Arts Council England. Maria Balshaw's appointment as director of the Tate sees her join a growing number of women in top jobs in the UK arts establishment. They include Frances Morris, who became Tate Modern's director last year, Jude Kelly, artistic director of London's Southbank Centre and Tamara Rojo, artistic director as well as principal lead dancer at English National Ballet. Vicky Featherstone and Josie Rourke head up London's Royal Court and Donmar Warehouse theatres, while Erica Whyman is deputy artistic director of the RSC and Cressida Pollock has been the ENO's chief executive officer since 2015. In the world of film, a pair of Amandas - Berry and Nevill - hold the chief executive positions at Bafta and the BFI respectively. As co-organiser of the annual Glastonbury Festival, Emily Eavis arguably occupies one of the most influential posts in the UK music scene. Not half as influential, though, as Karen Bradley MP's current role - that of Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.

The official citation marking Donald Mackintosh's VC reads: . \"For most conspicuous bravery and resolution in the face of intense machine gun fire. \"During the initial advance he was shot through the right leg, but though crippled he continued to lead his men and captured the trench. \"In the captured trench Lt. Mackintosh collected men of another company who had lost their leader, and drove back a counterattack. \"He was again wounded, and although unable to stand, he continued, nevertheless, to control the situation. \"With only fifteen men left, he ordered his party to be ready to advance to the final objective, and with great difficulty got out of the trench and encouraged his men to advance. \"He was again wounded and fell. \"The gallantry and devotion to duty of this officer were beyond all praise.\" Lt Mackintosh was just 21 when he was killed. British artillery had attacked German lines with heavy shells in preparation for the advance at Arras. But many German machine-gun positions remained intact. British units, including The Seaforths, suffered massive losses as they attacked. In many cases, more junior officers like Mackintosh were expected to rally soldiers whose company commanders had already fallen. By the time the Battle of Arras ended, the Allies had suffered 159,000 casualties, 46,000 of them Scots.", "abstract": "A memorial stone has been laid in Glasgow to honour a World War One officer who led a successful advance while so badly wounded he could not stand.", "candidate": "A Scottish soldier killed during World War One has been awarded the country's highest military honour.", "doc_id": 2152, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "A Scottish soldier killed during World War One has been awarded the Victoria Cross.", "evidence": "Lt Donald Mackintosh, who served with the Seaforth Highlanders, died in the Battle of Arras in 1917.", "explanation": "it makes up it being the country's highest military honour.", "instruction": "Replace the information about the country's highest military honour. with the information about the name of the award.", "instruction_list": ["Replace the information about the country's highest military honour. with the information about the name of the award."]}}
{"article": "Warburton wants to use the spur of helping Blues qualify for Europe to secure his spot on the three-Test tour in June. Four successive wins have put the Blues just a point outside the Pro12 top six. \"That is how I approach it, making it show that I am worthy of a place in the Welsh team,\" Warburton told BBC Wales. The eighth-placed Blues have two games remaining, starting with the Judgement Day showdown with Ospreys on 30 April at the Principality Stadium. They then visit direct rivals Edinburgh, currently sixth and a place ahead of Muster, on the final day of the campaign on 7 May. \"I have felt like the last two games for the Blues have been a trial for Wales if I am honest, there are some pretty big personal battles all across the field,\" Warburton said. \"You get a lot of respect for performing well in Welsh derbies, individually and as a team and for me personally, I have felt the need to prove myself all over again in a Blues shirt after the Six Nations. \"I still feel I have a point to prove when it comes to Welsh selection because I want to make sure you can go into the New Zealand tour, hopefully having your hand held up as one of the form players.\" Dual contract star Warburton says a return to his beloved Blues has been the perfect way to get over Wales failing to win the Six Nations. \"I still felt I was chasing a little bit of match fitness.

The key aim for the Conservative whips is to try get enough mainstream Labour MPs onside for the government's policy rather than relying on old Blairites to stick it to Mr Corbyn.

It warned the merger could cause \"long-term damage\" for UK consumers as it would leave only three mobile networks. CK Hutchison, the owner of Three, said it was \"very disappointed\" the CMA had published the letter. The European Commission has until 19 May to make a decision on Three's proposed \u00a310.5bn takeover of O2. Hutchison said: \"It is no surprise that CMA opposes the merger. It always has, and so has Ofcom. But it is for the Commission to assess any competition concerns, on the basis of the facts and proposed remedies.\" Sky, Virgin, Tesco and UK Broadband have agreed to use Three-O2's share of UK airwaves to offer their own mobile packages, the company said. \"The entry of so many diverse, strong and committed players will ensure that there is plenty of competition in the UK market and plenty of counter offers to any supposed price increases post-merger,\" it said. Three's owner added that it would invest \u00a35bn in UK mobile infrastructure and that new entrants would add a further \u00a35bn. The planned purchase of O2 by Hutchison, which is owned by Asia's richest person Li Ka-shing, was announced early last year. If approved, the deal would leave just two other major UK operators: EE and Vodafone. Hutchison sent its suggested remedies to the European Commission last week to smooth the takeover. The CMA said the remedies \"fall well short\" and insisted the Commission should instead force most of O2 or Three's mobile network to be sold off after the deal. \"Absent such structural remedies, the only option available to the Commission is prohibition,\" Alex Chisholm, chief executive of the CMA, said in the letter to the European Commission. European competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager will make the final decision on the deal, rather than UK regulators. \"At best we see UK deal approval odds at 50/50. The risk, here, is the decision could become increasingly political (from a UK perspective it already is) as it's so close to the Brexit vote,\" said Mandeep Singh, a partner at Redburn analysts.

{"article": "The review panel says WHO was too slow to act to get on top of the deadly virus which has now killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa. And it calls for an urgent overhaul of the organisation. WHO says it has plans for reform. It has already admitted that it waited too long to declare Ebola a public health emergency of international concern. WHO Director General, Margaret Chan, admitted in May it had been \"overwhelmed\" by the Ebola outbreak, saying it \"shook this organization to its core\". The disease began spreading in December 2013, but it took until August 2014 for WHO to sound the alarm. By that point, more than 1,000 people had died of the virus. The death toll now stands at more than 11,000. According to the report, WHO lacked a culture of rapid decision-making. In the early stages of the Ebola crisis, messages were sent about the seriousness of the situation but these \"either did not reach senior leaders or senior leaders did not recognise their significance\". \"There seems to have been a hope that the crisis could be managed by good diplomacy rather than by scaling up emergency action,\" the report says. WHO was also criticised for failing to keep governments and the public up to speed about the extent and severity of the outbreak. But the review praised WHO for playing a critical role in pushing forward work to find new treatments and cures for Ebola. And it said WHO should be given the job of leading future health emergency responses - be that for Ebola or an outbreak of pandemic flu, for example. The report suggests an immediate contribution from all member countries towards a $100 million special outbreak response fund, and says WHO should establish a Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response. The panel's head, Dame Barbara Stocking, former chief executive of the charity Oxfam, said the WHO must now be made fit for the task. \"To me, coming from somewhere like Oxfam which is an emergency culture, you are very much, if you like, on the front foot. You are always trying to prevent a situation coming through or grab it when it starts and really get it under control very fast and those are some of the internal changes that have to be made at WHO.\" The WHO said it was \"already moving forward\" on some of the panel's recommendations including the development of the global health emergency workforce and the contingency fund. It will be up to member states to make these voluntary financial contributions. Dr Joanne Liu, President of MSF International, questioned how the recommendations would translate to real action on the ground. \"We have seen so many reports calling for change, with everyone focused on how to improve future response and meanwhile, with 20-25 new Ebola cases per week in the region, we still don`t have the current epidemic under control. On Ebola, we went from global indifference, to global fear, to global response and now to global fatigue. We must finish the job,\" she said.

{"article": "A senior official at the Tunisian interior ministry told the Associated Press that Rezgui had been in Libya in January, the same time as two men who attacked a Tunisian museum in March. Most of the dead in Sousse were foreign tourists, including 30 Britons. The Islamic State group (IS) has claimed the attack as its own. \"The attacker trained in Libya with weapons at the same period as the Bardo [museum] attackers,\" Rafik Chelli from the interior ministry told AP. IS also said it was behind the Bardo museum attack in Tunis that left 22 people dead. Mr Chelli said that Rezgui had travelled to the Libyan town of Sabratha at the same time as the Bardo attackers. \"He crossed the borders secretly,\" Mr Chielli told AP. IS has a significant presence in Libya, Tunisia's eastern neighbour, and is thought to control the major towns of Derna and Sirte. The Tunisian authorities have released photos of two suspects, Bin Abdallah and Rafkhe Talari - friends of Rezgui that the police have yet to locate. Rezgui, 23, was radicalised while studying engineering. The Tunisian authorities have already arrested several suspected accomplices. However, Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi has admitted that the security services were not prepared for an attack of this kind. He said extra security had been put in place at other locations during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, but nobody had expected beaches to be a target. The UK Foreign Office has updated its travel advice to warn that further terrorist attacks in Tunisia are possible, and has urged people to be vigilant. Tour companies have laid on extra flights and about 10,000 British tourists have flown home from Tunisia since Friday, according to the Association of British Travel Agents. The repatriation of bodies of Britons killed in the attack will begin on Wednesday, Downing Street has said. Twenty-one Britons have been identified as victims, with nine more believed to be among the dead, it added. Three Irish tourists, two Germans, a Belgian and a Portuguese national died in the attack.

{"article": "The announcement came after a pact was agreed between the Socialists and centre-right Ciudadanos (Citizens). \"What has been agreed with Ciudadanos is incompatible with us,\" said Podemos's Inigo Errejon. It deals a blow to Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez's hopes of becoming PM. Between them, the Socialists and Ciudadanos command only 130 seats in the 350-seat lower house - leaving Mr Sanchez far short of a parliamentary majority. In a vote on 1 March, he will seek the support of deputies in a vote of confidence that the former ruling Popular Party (PP), led by acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, has indicated it is likely to oppose. Podemos now appears less likely to offer its support - overtly or tacitly, in the form of abstentions - now it has framed the pact between the Socialists (PSOE) and Ciudadanos as \"an invitation to the PP\". \"For the moment we have failed,\" Mr Errejon was quoted as saying. \"The change [we sought] was not just to remove Mr Rajoy from the Moncloa [prime ministerial residence], but his policies.\" Earlier, signing a deal based on a five-point plan for constitutional reform, Ciudadanos leader Albert Rivera had urged other parties to come on board. Podemos's radical policies are at odds with the liberal-centrist slant of Ciudadanos, and it had already warned they were unlikely to join forces, but it was not clear that Podemos would withdraw from the negotiating table entirely. Should Mr Sanchez fail to secure an absolute majority on 2 March, he could then aim for a simple majority in a second vote on 5 March. If he fails, the PP may attempt once again to form a coalition - perhaps a \"grand coalition\" with the Socialists and Ciudadanos.

{"article": "She told her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party in Berlin she expected her toughest campaign yet and would \"fight for our values and our way of life\". An election is due to be held next year after four years of coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD). Mrs Merkel's poll ratings have slipped since the height of her popularity but she retains wide support. The chancellor, who has been in office since 2005, is also being challenged by the populist right-wing AfD party. She announced she would stand again after meeting party leaders at CDU headquarters. She told reporters that the decision to run for a fourth term had been \"anything but trivial after 11 years in office\". She added that she expected challenges from both the right and the left of the political spectrum. Is Merkel really on the ropes? Profile: Angela Merkel . In September, Mrs Merkel accepted responsibility for election defeats for the CDU in several states and conceded that her open-door policy towards migrants was a factor. Germany expected up to 300,000 migrants to arrive in the country this year, the head of the country's federal office for migration and refugees said earlier this year. In 2015, Germany received more than a million applications for asylum. She's kept Germany guessing for weeks, but it looks as though Angela Merkel has finally answered the so called K-frage (chancellor question). A poll for one Sunday newspaper (in German) found that 55% of Germans would vote for her. Mrs Merkel's approval ratings have gone up and down in recent months as a result of her refugee policy but they remain the envy of other world leaders. Even so, she will be battling the tide of populism that swept Donald Trump to victory in the States and which is also washing across Europe. The anti-Muslim party Alternative fuer Deutschland (AfD) is likely to win seats in the national parliament next year. It's highly unlikely to take Mrs Merkel down but it is leaching votes from Germany's established political parties. Those parties are - by and large - likely to be relieved by Mrs Merkel's decision. In the past few years the job of German chancellor has become one of the most powerful political positions in the world. The next incumbent must not only lead the country but deal with a fragmenting EU, in a world which may be much changed by the new US administration. It's widely (sometimes grudgingly ) accepted here that there simply isn't another realistic candidate for the job. As one broadcaster put it: \"Angela Merkel - the indispensable\".

{"article": "The list of MPs who will chair Labour policy committees reads like a who's who of Mr Corbyn's internal critics. They include pro-Trident MP John Woodcock who reportedly turned the air blue at a Blairite event as he summed up his views on Mr Corbyn's leadership. The annual Parliamentary party departmental committee elections normally pass without controversy. But this year there appears to have been a concerted effort by Corbyn-sceptic MPs to gain control of one of the party's policy making mechanisms, according to grassroots website Labour List. Particularly as only four of the 17 posts were contested - although that may be because most of Corbyn's Labour allies already have roles as shadow ministers. Former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie, who has said Mr Corbyn's economic policy would result in \"higher inflation and higher cost of living\" which would hit \"the very people we should be standing up for\", will chair the Parliamentary Party's Treasury committee. Ian Austin, who tweeted \"I'm getting a little tired of the self-indulgent comfort-zone fantasy that Corbyn could ever persuade mainstream voters to make him PM,\" will chair the party's education committee. Shabana Mahmood, who quit the shadow cabinet, because she \"strongly disagreed\" with Mr Corbyn's economic policies, will chair the justice committee. Other Corbyn critics to be appointed to committee chairs include Caroline Flint, Tristram Hunt, Ivan Lewis, Mike Gapes and Emma Reynolds. They will have the power to stand in for shadow ministers at the despatch box, although this is rarely used, and influence policy decisions behind the scenes. Who chairs Labour backbench committees doesn't usually make the headlines - but then there has rarely been such a gulf between a leader and many of his own MPs. The lack of support for Jeremy Corbyn at Westminster was underlined by the fact that all but two of the successful candidates backed either Liz Kendall or Yvette Cooper for leader - and none backed him. Mr Corbyn had said he wanted these positions to become more influential - and that is exactly the intention of the new chairmen and women, too. Nine of them will serve on Labour's National Policy Forum. John Woodcock - who is now the Parliamentary Labour Party's defence chairman - said he will remind his leadership that MPs were elected on a policy of retaining the nuclear deterrent. And the new Treasury chairman Chris Leslie has denounced both his leader - and the shadow chancellor's - economic policies. Mr Corbyn is at odds with his many of his centre-left MPs in key policy areas, including the renewal of Trident, the welfare cap and military action in Syria. But he has vowed to open up the party's policy making process to its members, the vast majority of whom voted for him to be leader. This has sparked fears among \"moderate\" MPs that their views will be sidelined. \"Many MPs feel the agenda of many of Corbyn's backers is less about Jeremy, more about a left realignment of the party,\" writes an anonymous columnist on Blairite website Progress. \"This would be achieved with manifestos decided by conferences and executive meetings, with MPs restrained by fear of reselection.

{"article": "But his pro-Western party is set to win 41% of the votes, short of the majority he wanted to ensure a push to join Nato and the EU. Mr Djukanovic had presented the vote as a choice between the West or becoming a \"Russian colony\". Earlier, authorities said 20 Serbian paramilitaries had been arrested. Prosecutors said the group may have been planning to kidnap Mr Djukanovic, who has been in charge for a quarter of a century. The development, hours before voting took place, was described by opposition Democratic Front leader Andrija Mandic as \"gross propaganda\" and Serbia's prime minister, Aleksandar Vucic, said the timing was strange. Serbia's former special forces commander, Bratislav Dikic, who was removed from the post in 2013 because of alleged criminal activities, was reported to be among those arrested. The men had been charged with terror offences and one Serb was still on the run, Montenegro's police chief said. Montenegro: Nato's newest and last member? Montenegro country profile . Mr Djukanovic will now try to form a majority with smaller parties, and told supporters as the results came through that \"tonight we can say that Montenegro will continue its path towards a secure place in Europe\". Montenegro would formally join Nato in months and step up talks on joining the EU, he said. The Democratic Front Alliance, made up of largely pro-Serbian and pro-Russian groups, is forecast to win just over 20% of the votes. It also hopes to form a coalition among other opposition parties.

{"article": "The Japanese engineer created many popular drum machines, including the iconic TR-808. Its sound is a staple of hip-hop and electronic music, used by everyone from Kanye West to Marvin Gaye. Kakehashi received a technical Grammy in 2013 for contributions to electronic music technology. Dave Smith - Kakehashi's co-winner - told the BBC he \"was just an amazing man, a good friend, a very good competitor of course and just innovative continually all that time\". Before leading Roland for 40 years, Mr Kakehashi founded Ace Tone in the 1960s. The firm made amplifiers and primitive drum machines, laying the groundwork for the engineer's future success. The sound of the TR-808 proved a game-changer in the 1980s and 90s. It appears on Marvin Gaye's \"Sexual Healing\", and in the opening bars of Whitney Houston's \"I Wanna Dance with Somebody\". Rapper Kanye West's 2008 album 808s & Heartbreak showcases the machine throughout. Musicians have shared their tributes to Mr Kakehashi online, calling his impact immeasurable. Marc Almond of synthpop duo Soft Cell called him \"a man who changed music\". Martyn Ware, who played keyboards for The Human League, told the BBC: \"Roland was central to everything that we did for the whole of the first two albums - they featured on every track.\" \"We were loyal to them like people would be loyal to a football team.\" In 2015 the TR-808 was the subject of a documentary featuring Pharrell Williams, Fatboy Slim, and Phil Collins - among many others.

{"article": "The Victorian-era vessel became part of nautical folklore after it vanished in the mid-19th Century. Its captain, Sir John Franklin, had been searching for the fabled Northwest Passage. Experts on Thursday confirmed that the wreck, discovered last month, was indeed the celebrated Royal Navy vessel. \"It is in astonishing condition,'' said search team member John Geiger, president of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society. \"We're over the moon.\" The ship set sail from England in 1845 under Sir John's command. He was accompanied by a second ship, HMS Terror, captained by Francis Crozier. Alongside Sir John were 128 officers, all of them aiming to find the elusive sea route linking the Atlantic to the Pacific via the Arctic seas off northern Canada. The two vessels were last seen in the summer of that year bypassing whaling boats in Baffin Bay, off the coast of Greenland. But soon afterwards, the ships vanished. Inuit hunters told tales of starving white men who had been seen in the freezing wilderness over the following months and years. Historians speculated that the ships had become trapped in the vast ice floes of the Canadian Arctic. But until Thursday the exact fate of HMS Erebus had not been known. The ship was discovered after the Canadian government ploughed millions of pounds into an extensive search operation. It was found under just 11 metres of water near King William Island, 2,000km (1,200 miles) north-west of Toronto. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper even participated in the search himself, such was his determination to resolve the mystery. HMS Terror has still not been discovered.

{"article": "Despite returning 80 more councillors, 184 in total, at Thursday's local elections in Wales, the party only took control of Monmouthshire. Welsh Tory chairman Jonathan Evans said June's poll will be regarded as a Theresa May-Jeremy Corbyn battle. Welsh Labour's Chris Evans said the local election results gave the party a \"firm foundation\" to build on. Although Labour lost more than 100 councillors in Wales, taking its tally down to 472, and lost control of both Bridgend and Blaenau Gwent councils, the results were not as bad for the party as had been predicted. Labour was also three seats short of a majority in Merthyr Tydfil, but polling has been delayed until next month in the Cyfarthfa ward following the death of a candidate. It means a five-week wait before the council's final political makeup is clear. The ward elected two independents and one Labour councillor in 2012. Ex-MP and general election candidate in June Chris Evans said: \"What's quite clear is Labour in Wales is much stronger than the polls are telling us at the moment. \"People haven't deserted the Labour Party - people still have faith and they're still strong with the Labour Party and that is what we will build on in the next four weeks.\" Jonathan Evans, who is running the Conservative general election campaign in Wales, told the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme there had been a range of alternatives to Labour in Welsh elections. But he said: \"In the general election it's my expectation that people will see this as a two party contest. \"The election has been presented as a choice between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May. \"I see it that way, and the public see it that way as well and I think that is going to be very helpful for the Conservative Party in these elections.\" Plaid Cymru said gaining more than 30 councillors, meaning the party now has 202, was \"great news\". It said voting patterns in some local election areas were a cause for optimism ahead of the general election. Ynys Mon AM Rhun ap Iorwerth said it was \"pleasing\" to see gains \"in places where we aren't seen as traditionally strong\". \"Looking across the board it's got to be seen I think as a pretty solid result for Plaid Cymru and bodes well for the poll which is coming up in just a few weeks' time.\" The Liberal Democrats lost 11 council seats and now have 62 councillors in Wales in what Lib Dem AM and Welsh Government Education Secretary Kirsty Williams called \"a mixed set of results\". But she said local election voting should not be seen as a prediction of what will happen on 8 June. \"I think we have to be very careful not to make a direct read across from local government elections to the general election,\" she said. \"What's absolutely clear is that politics is in a state of flux and there are arguments to be made on doorsteps in the weeks to come.\" UKIP AM Gareth Bennett said his party still had a key role despite failing to win any councillors in Wales and losing 145 in England. \"UKIP should have a future because there are so many issues which will be unresolved in British politics which the main parties won't tackle,\" he said. \"Who the heck is going to tackle these if not UKIP?\" Sunday Politics Wales, BBC One Wales, 11:00 BST, 7 May .", "abstract": "Welsh Conservatives will benefit from a general election seen as a two party contest, a senior Tory has said.", "candidate": "Labour is \"much stronger than the polls are telling us\", the party's Welsh leader has said.", "doc_id": 1194, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "Ex-MP and general election candidate in June Chris Evans said: \"What's quite clear is Labour in Wales is much stronger than the polls are telling us at the moment.", "explanation": "Chris Evans is one of the leaders for the Welsh labour party and he quoted about labour being much stronger than the polls suggest.

{"article": "Shadow Scottish Secretary Margaret Curran has written to the UK government offering support for early legislation. The Scottish government has already called for action before Westminster breaks for the general election. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael has said officials are looking at the options. These are likely to include a section 30 order which is much less complicated than an act of parliament. In a letter to the Scottish secretary, Ms Curran said: \"I am writing to offer our support for a Section 30 order to devolve the franchise to the Scottish Parliament immediately if it is brought forward by the government. \"This will ensure that there is enough time for the Scottish Parliament to make the changes necessary to ensure 16 and 17-year-olds are able to vote in 2016.\" The Smith Commission on further devolution called for the UK to \"devolve the relevant powers in sufficient time\" for that election. Its recommendations were agreed by all five political parties in the Scottish Parliament. The independence referendum was the first national vote in which 16 and 17-year-olds were able to take part. The chief counting officer for the referendum, Mary Pitcaithly, chairs the board that oversees election management in Scotland. She said: \"If changes of this significance are going to be made, the earlier that election professionals know about this the better, so that appropriate preparations can be made to minimise any risks\". Mr Carmichael discussed the issue with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon last week. Ahead of that meeting he said he saw \"no reason\" why votes at 16 could not be in place for the 2016 vote. Labour also wants him to consider which other powers might be suitable for fast-track devolution. Ms Curran said: \"Many of the Smith Commission proposals will require primary legislation, and Labour will introduce a Scotland Act in our first Queen's Speech. \"However, it is right that we should assess which powers could be passed more quickly and where the Labour Party could offer its support.\" The Scottish government has specifically called for early control of air passenger duty and disability living allowance.

{"article": "Their study of more than 7,000 people suggests exposure to bleach and other chemicals is a factor in one in six cases of adult-onset asthma among British people in their mid-50s . The study, in Thorax, identified 18 high-risk jobs - four of which involved cleaning. Top of the list were farmers, followed by aircraft mechanics and typesetters. General cleaners, office cleaners, domestic helpers and care workers all featured on the list. So too did hairdressers and laundry workers. Experts say a person's working environment is to blame rather than their occupation per se. Hundreds of occupational agents have been linked to asthma. This includes flour and grain as well as detergents. Fine particles can be inhaled into the airways and cause irritation. Lead researcher Dr Rebecca Ghosh said cleaning products were starting to be recognised as a potential cause of asthma. She said there were specific Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) guidelines relating to cleaning products. Employers are expected to control exposures to hazardous substances and report any cases of occupational asthma. \"Occupational asthma is widely under-recognised by employers, employees and healthcare professionals. Raising awareness that this is an almost entirely preventable disease would be a major step in reducing its incidence,\" Dr Ghosh said. Malayka Rahman, of Asthma UK, said: \"We advise anyone who works in the industries highlighted in this study and who have experienced breathing problems to discuss this with their GP, and we urge healthcare professionals to make sure they consider possible occupational causes in adult-onset asthma and tailor their advice to people with asthma accordingly.\"", "abstract": "People who work with cleaning products risk developing asthma, believe UK experts who have explored the link.", "candidate": "Cleaning products may be a risk factor for asthma, according to researchers at the University of Bristol.", "doc_id": 759, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Cleaning products may be a risk factor for asthma, according to a scientific study.", "evidence": "The study, in Thorax, identified 18 high-risk jobs - four of which involved cleaning.", "explanation": "The summary states the study was done by the University of Bristol and that information was not given in the source text.", "instruction": "Replace the information about researchers at the University of Bristol with the information about a scientific study.", "instruction_list": ["Replace the information about researchers at the University of Bristol with the information about a scientific study."]}}
{"article": "Kevin McKearney and his elderly uncle Jack McKearney were shot at their family shop in County Tyrone in 1992 by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). Their family has welcomed the report by the Historical Enquiries Team (HET). The HET found no evidence of security force collusion but also said it could not allay the family's suspicions. The report has identified eight areas of concern about the security force operation, both in the lead up to and the aftermath of the murders. The McKearney family were well-known in Republican circles and felt they were particularly vulnerable to attack. Days before the murders, Kevin's mother Maura had received a telephone call threatening that three men \"in white coats\" would be killed in Moy Square. The family, several of whom wore white coats while working at the butchers shop they owned in the centre of the County Tyrone village, reported the call to police through a local councillor. The HET report has concluded that the RUC \"did not formally record or investigate the reported death threat\". It stated that the McKearney family were given no police advice about their personal security after they were threatened. The inquiries team also said that the loss of forensic material during the RUC investigation, and the \"fact that a special branch officer was aware of the getaway car three minutes after the murders\" remained unexplained. Kevin McKearney, a father of four, was working behind the counter of the butcher shop on 3 January 1992 when a gunman walked in a shot him several times. The 32 year old died at the scene. His 68-year-old uncle John McKearney - known as Jack - was shot and seriously wounded in the attack. He was taken to hospital but died from his injuries three months later on 4 April 1992. The murders took place two weeks after a Protestant man was shot dead by Republican paramilitaries at his family's shop in the same village. Robin Farmer, the 19-year-old son of a policeman, was murdered on 21 December 1991 by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA). The HET report stated Mr Farmer's murder had \"raised fears among the Catholic community in Moy of a retaliatory attack because of the history of tit-for-tat sectarian murders in mid-Ulster throughout the Troubles\". Mrs McKearney received the death threat from anonymous caller just six days after the teenager was killed. The butcher shop murders were not the first time the Troubles had affected the McKearney family. Three of Kevin's brothers had joined the IRA. In May 1974, his older brother Sean McKearney died when a bomb he was planting at a petrol station outside Dungannon exploded prematurely . In May 1987, his brother Patrick McKearney was one of eight IRA men killed by the SAS when they tried to attack Loughall police station in County Armagh. Last year, a HET report into that incident concluded that the IRA opened fire first. A third brother, Tommy McKearney, was jailed for his involvement in the killing of a part-time UDR soldier in 1976. Tommy McKearney spent 53 days on hunger strike in the Maze Prison, and now works as an author and freelance journalist. At the time of Kevin's death, his parents insisted that he had no paramilitary links. He had worked at the butchers shop since leaving school. Among its conclusions, the HET report stated: \"Kevin and Jack were not members of any paramilitary groups. They were both completely innocent victims.\" The HET is a specialist police team set up in 2005 to re-examine 3,269 murders which took place during the Troubles.", "abstract": "A new report into the murders of two men shot by loyalist paramiltaries 20 years ago has concluded the RUC did not do enough to prevent their murders.", "candidate": "A report into the murders of two Catholic men by republican paramilitaries has found no evidence of collusion between the security forces and the killers.", "doc_id": 1807, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "A report into the murders of two men during The Troubles has found no evidence of collusion between the security forces and the killers.", "evidence": "The HET found no evidence of security force collusion but also said it could not allay the family's suspicions.", "explanation": "The summary iis incorrect because it misinterprets that the two men were murdered by\"republican paramilitaries\" and that they were  \"among the Catholic community\".

{"article": "Experts say tiger numbers are the most reliable indicators of the health of the population. But they also warn that it is more important to monitor individual tiger populations every year to really get a handle on their health. \"Once-in-four-years country-wide estimates do not have much practical use. But everyone, including politicians and conservationists, seems to set much in store by these numbers,\" says Dr K Ulhas Karanth, one of India's top conservation experts. According to the latest tiger census, the tiger population rose from 1,706 in 2011 to 2,226 in 2014. The latest tiger estimation identified 1,540 tigers through images collected from 9,735 camera trap locations in 18 states. \"Because of the extensive survey effort and camera trap results, which identified nearly 70% of the estimated tiger number; these figures are the most accurate ever,\" claims WWF India, one of the country's top conservation organisations. Sure, tiger numbers have definitely increased since 2006 when India upped investments under pressure from global and international conservationists in hiring more guards, protecting reserves and promoting voluntary village relocation. All this helped, say experts, in many parts of India, although over large swathes, tigers have been wiped out or are in low numbers. But many questions remain. What is the state of availability of prey in India's tiger reserves? Every tiger requires a breeding prey population of 500 animals in its territory to ensure a \"food bank\". Tiger populations thrive on abundant prey - a breeding female tiger produces a litter of three cubs every third year. Mortality rates can be high: Dr Karanth's studies show 20% or more higher mortality rates in a thriving tiger habitat in Nagarhole in southern India. \"If we have 600 breeding tigresses in India, we will be adding 600 cubs to the population every year. So we should not be obsessing over individual tiger deaths and focus on population recovery,\" says Dr Karanth. India has some 200,000 sq km (77,220 sq miles) of tiger habitat. Well-managed habitats with abundant prey can support anything between 5,000 to 10,000 tigers in the long run. \"We have a long way to go, but it is doable if we get our act together. This is no time to be complacent,\" cautions Dr Karanth.", "abstract": "How good is the news that India has almost a third more tigers than it did four years ago?", "candidate": "India's latest estimation that there are more than 2,000 tigers in the country is a boost for conservationists, but what is the long-term picture?", "doc_id": 1865, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "But everyone, including politicians and conservationists, seems to set much in store by these numbers,\" says Dr K Ulhas Karanth, one of India's top conservation experts.", "explanation": "The summary is correct because the source supports that \"According to the latest tiger census, the tiger population rose from 1,706 in 2011 to 2,226 in 2014.\" \"conservationists, seems to set much in store by these numbers,\", \"But many questions remain.

{"article": "The verdict threatens Apple's ability to offer its voice-controlled virtual assistant, Siri, in the country. Shanghai-based Zhizhen Network Technology has sought to block Apple from selling products with the app installed, saying it infringed its rights. Apple said it would pursue an appeal with the Beijing Higher People's Court. \"Apple believes deeply in protecting innovation, and we take intellectual property rights very seriously,\" said a spokesman. \"Apple created Siri to provide customers with their own personal assistant by using their voice. \"Unfortunately, we were not aware of Zhizhen's patent before we introduced Siri, and we do not believe we are using this patent. \"While a separate court considers this question, we remain open to reasonable discussions with Zhizhen.\" The Chinese company could not be reached for comment. Zhizhen offers its own voice-controlled service, named Xiao i Robot, which began life, in 2003, as a text-based chatbot that ran on others' instant-messaging tools. It later evolved into call-centre software used by the Chinese government and several companies. In addition, Zhizhen developed voice-controlled software for smart TVs, cars and smartphones - including an iPhone app that allows users to find restaurants, train times and stock prices. In June 2012, Zhizhen accused Apple of intellectual property infringement after the US company announced at its developers' conference that Mandarin and Cantonese were being added to the list of Siri's supported languages. Zhizhen noted that it had filed for the intellectual rights to the underlying technology in 2004 and had been granted the patent two years later. Apple countered that Siri used a different process to power its voice-recognition tech - a court has yet to rule on this claim. Apple also sought to block the case by asking China's State Intellectual Property Office to invalidate the patent, but was refused. It then challenged that decision, suing both the patent authority and Zhizhen - but was thwarted on Tuesday when Beijing's Number One Intermediate People's Court ruled against it.

{"article": "She also understands why athletes get into trouble because \"sometimes your mind isn't 100% as all you're thinking about is training\". According to the Daily Mail, Mo Farah missed two tests before winning double Olympic gold for Britain in 2012. The Mail says the second one came at Farah's home in February 2011, when he claimed not to have heard the doorbell. Nine UK athletes missed two tests in the same year as Farah did. Yet UK Anti-Doping chief executive Nicole Sapstead told BBC Sport that it is \"not common\" for an athlete to miss a test. Farah's gold medals in the 5,000m and 10,000m at London 2012 were among the defining moments of the Games. At the time, UK Anti-Doping rules stated that an athlete who missed three tests in any 18-month period could face a ban of up to two years. That meant Farah could have been ruled out of his home Olympics with one more breach of the regulations. The rules have since been amended and athletes who now miss three tests in a 12-month period can be banned for four years. Sotherton said top-level athletes are tested up to 20 times a year and have to know three months in advance where they are going to be. \"You are never free of drug testing,\" said the 38-year-old, who won Olympic bronze at the 2004 Games in Athens. \"I've been tested nine times in six weeks before - at my house, at the track, at my partner's house. \"But a missed test doesn't mean you are doping. It may mean you have been a little bit careless. That doesn't make you a drugs cheat. \"I was very organised and I made a slip of a number by one day. That's how a missed test can happen.\" Sotherton's sentiments were echoed by Jenny Meadows. \"It is very difficult to work out where you are going to be three months in advance,\" said the former European indoor 800m champion. \"You do have to remember, of course, where you said you would be and make sure you are at that place. Even this week I was out of the house before my testing slot should have started.\" While European and Commonwealth 800m silver medallist Lynsey Sharp spent one hour every day for two weeks sat in a Boston cafe while on holiday because the doorbell did not work in her rented apartment. \"There is not a lot of room for mistakes,\" said Sharp. \"I do think we have great system but it can make it difficult for athletes.\" Michael Rimmer, who won an 800m silver medal at the 2010 European Championships, said he had missed tests in the past and has suggested athletes are tagged so the testers know where they are at all times. But Michele Verroken, a sports ethics and anti-doping adviser, said there had to be \"an element of surprise\" to testing. \"There is no obligation on the testing agency to test you in just that hour because athletes would manipulate the system and provide you with a clean sample,\" she said. Christine Ohuruogu, who won 400m gold at the 2012 Olympics, was given a one-year ban in 2006 for missing three out-of-competition tests. The independent disciplinary committee which heard the Briton's case admitted it was a \"harsh sanction\" for someone who had \"no intention of infringing anti-doping rules\". The ban was described as a \"much-needed wake-up call for athletes\" by John Scott, who was UK Sport director of drug-free sport.

{"article": "The charges start from 1 April 2017 and will increase BT's annual valuation fourfold, from \u00a3165m to \u00a3743m. \"We are extremely disappointed by the new rateable values, which are clearly excessive,\" BT said. On Friday, the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) published revaluation details of 1.96 million non-domestic properties in England and Wales. But BT said: \"It is highly likely that an increase of this size would lead to higher prices for consumers and businesses.\" The telecoms giant warned that if the proposed new rates are brought in, \"it could have a negative impact on future investment in the network\". That point was echoed by Virgin Media chief executive Tom Mockridge, who said: \"The Chancellor Philip Hammond is choosing to side-step responsibility for a huge increase in infrastructure taxes, at the very moment after the Brexit vote the UK needs to maximise investment into its digital fibre network.\" BT said it will challenge the VOA's \"method and assumptions\". \"The Government has made it clear that it wants companies such as BT to invest heavily in the UK. We have stepped up to that challenge but we need a more joined up and logical approach from the public sector if there is to be a more conducive environment for investment,\" the company said. The proposed rates will be welcomed by many small businesses, which will see a drop in their charges. That is because they have overpaid in recent years, as rates have been based on 2008 valuations which are now out of date, said the Federation of Small Businesses. Chairman Mike Cherry said: \"Many businesses across the country will be getting some relief from years of overpayment or see their rates remain steady. \"In other areas, there will be a big jump between the old valuation and the new one. To avoid such big discrepancies in payments, we believe more frequent valuations are necessary.\" But he added that transitional relief plans, which were announced by the government earlier this week, will help reduce some of the pain for those facing a big rate hike. Under proposed changes to Small Business Rate Relief announced in the March 2016 Budget, small firms with a rateable value of less than \u00a312,000 will pay no business rates at all, with further assistance handed to those with a rateable value of under \u00a351,000. \"It means that today's revaluations could have big consequences, especially for those firms on the margins of these cut-off points,\" said Mr Cherry. Local Government Minister Marcus Jones said: \"Local firms also need to be confident that the rates they pay are accurate and fair, no matter where they are in the country, and these updates will give them that reassurance. \"We are committed to helping all businesses flourish and as we make the system fairer up and down the country, nearly three quarters of companies will see no change, or even a fall, in their bills - including 600,000 who from next April will have their bills cut altogether. \"But for the small minority of businesses that do face an increase, we're putting in place \u00a33.4bn of transitional relief to provide vital support as they adjust to these changes.\"", "abstract": "BT has condemned \"excessive\" new business rates, which it says will push up the cost of broadband services.", "candidate": "BT will see its annual business rates bill rise by more than \u00a3400m as a result of new valuations.", "doc_id": 1462, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "The charges start from 1 April 2017 and will increase BT's annual valuation fourfold, from \u00a3165m to \u00a3743m.", "explanation": "The summary id correct because the source supports that these new valuations will change BT business rate and that the increase is over  \u00a3400m.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

He said that he was not aware his actions were illegal. \"The explosives I bought are readily available in most department stores, and even most law enforcers I have spoken to are not aware that they are illegal,\" he told the BBC. He said that he had detonated exploding targets before on his remote farmland west of Scottsbluff, Nebraska, without upsetting anyone. How are new babies celebrated around the world? He said that Saturday's explosion contained blue smoke - caused by chalk powder - to tell the outside world that his wife Ashley is expecting a baby boy. Mr Sterkel, 26, can be heard proclaiming \"it's a boy!\" on the video of the explosion which has been widely featured on numerous US websites. But the blast was so loud that police in nearby Scottsbluff were alerted, with some residents concerned that a major disaster had taken place. Mr Sterkel said that he immediately called the local sheriff to explain what had happened in addition to apologising for his actions. \"I would like to say sorry for all of the confusion,\" he said. \"I am a man of character and will willingly go to court if the district attorney chooses to prosecute me. \"This was just our way of announcing what gender our baby was.\" Mr Sterkel faces charges for detonating the explosive without a valid permit. There was no damage or injury but he could be punished with a prison sentence and a fine of $1,000 (\u00c2\u00a3800).

{"article": "UK passport holder Lee Bo, 65 - also known as Paul Lee - is one of five booksellers who have gone missing. All five men worked for a publisher known for books critical of China. Activists fear they have been detained by Chinese officials. The Foreign Office said it was \"deeply concerned\". The disappearances have sparked fury from lawmakers and activists in semi-autonomous Hong Kong, adding to growing unease that freedoms in the city are being eroded, the BBC's Hong Kong correspondent Juliana Liu said. Mr Lee is the latest bookseller to go missing, after raising the alarm about four of his colleagues at publishing house Mighty Current, who disappeared in October. He disappeared last week and was last seen in Hong Kong. A letter faxed to his bookshop, apparently written by Mr Lee, says he travelled to China on his own and is fine. Activists believe the letter is genuine - but was written under duress. However, Mr Lee's wife, Sophie Choi, has withdrawn her request for police to help find him saying he has been in contact. She had previously told the BBC she was \"really afraid\" about his whereabouts. The 'unprecedented' case of the missing Hong Kong bookseller . Hong Kong bookstore disappearances shock publishing industry . Speaking at a news conference in Beijing alongside his counterpart, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Mr Hammond said he had raised concerns about Mr Lee's whereabouts. \"These people have gone missing. A Mr Lee Bo, who is a British passport holder, has gone missing and we have urgently enquired both of the Hong Kong authorities and of the mainland Chinese authorities what if anything they know of his whereabouts,\" he said. Mr Wang told journalists the missing bookseller was \"first and foremost a Chinese citizen\", while the Chinese foreign ministry has said other countries had \"no right to interfere\". But Mr Hammond said that any charges against Mr Lee should be dealt with in Hong Kong, not mainland China. \"Our view is that the Basic Law, the joint declaration, the principle of One Country Two Systems means that in a question of any breach of Hong Kong laws the question must be settled in Hong Kong by the Hong Kong judicial system.\" Mr Lee's disappearance has sparked an outcry in Hong Kong, where some suspect he may have been kidnapped and illegally transported across the border to mainland China - in a process akin to extraordinary rendition. Activists believe he may have been detained because of a book about the private life of Chinese President Xi Jinping. The BBC's correspondent in Beijing, Steve Evans, said the booksellers had been publishing \"pretty scurrilous stuff about mainland Chinese politicians\" which was freely available in Hong Kong, but had been seeping over into mainland China. If they have been snatched by the Chinese authorities, that would represent a breach of the guarantees made by China to Britain when Hong Kong was handed over to China in 1997, he said. \"It matters for Hong Kong, because if there is perceived to be an erosion of the rule of law, that throws into doubt the whole basis on which this system of one country, two economic systems, is upheld,\" he said.

However, his adult son, who did not wish to be named, told local media that the man was a \"good father\" who had changed. \"He's just got a massive heart. He's made mistakes, we've accepted it... he's made up for them,\" he said. The case of baby Gammy has made international headlines and caused uproar in Australia. Besides Down's syndrome, the six-month-old has a congenital heart condition and a lung infection. Surrogate mother Pattharamon Chanbua, who has been looking after Gammy, said the couple had asked her to have an abortion when she was told of the child's condition four months after becoming pregnant. She said she refused, as it was against her Buddhist beliefs. Abortion on the grounds of foetal impairment is illegal in Thailand. Ms Chanbua, 21, has said the father met the twins, but only took care of the girl. The parents have told local media in Australia that they did not know of his existence, and claimed that the allegations made by Ms Chanbua are lies. Meanwhile, Thai authorities say they have found six boys and three girls, all aged two or younger, in a condominium in Bangkok. The children were accompanied by several nannies and a pregnant woman. A Thai lawyer told police he was representing a Japanese man, who was father to all the surrogate babies, telling the Bangkok Post that the surrogacy arrangements were all legal. Deputy national police chief Aek Angsananont told Reuters news agency: \"We are questioning the nannies, as well as asking for co-operation from the Japanese embassy, to help conduct DNA testing. \"If the Japanese man admits that all the children are his babies, we would ask him why he wanted to have so many babies.\" Commercial surrogacy is not illegal in Thailand, although the authorities are now seeking to tighten regulations. Thailand is a popular destination for surrogacy arrangements, along with the US, India, and Russia. Thailand's medical governing body has recently said that its rules prohibit same-sex couples or single people from engaging a surrogate mother, fees should not be paid, and the surrogate mother must be a blood relative of the intended parents.", "abstract": "Australia's child protection services have contacted a couple accused of abandoning a baby with Down's syndrome to his surrogate mother in Thailand.", "candidate": "Authorities in Western Australia have contacted an Australian couple accused of abandoning their Down's syndrome baby in Thailand.", "doc_id": 1505, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "Western Australia Child Protection Minister Helen Morton told Fairfax Radio on Thursday: \"We've had telephone contact with the family and we're in the process of putting other arrangements in place.\"", "explanation": "The designation of the baby as \"their baby\" (the couple's) is reasonable.

{"article": "Mr Maduro issued a decree to convene a constituent assembly amid continuing anti-government protests. The president says a new constitution will bring peace to Venezuela, but the opposition says it is a ruse to delay holding elections. More than 50 people have been killed in protest-related violence since 1 April. Mr Maduro signed the decree at a rally attended by thousands of his supporters. He said the assembly would be made up of 540 members, some of whom would be elected at local level while the rest would be chosen from various groups such as students, workers, farmers, pensioners, and indigenous people. The National Electoral Council later said that elections for the constituent assembly would be held at the end of July. The move was immediately denounced by the opposition-controlled National Assembly. National Assembly leader Julio Borges called it \"nothing more than an evil announcement meant to divide, distract, and confuse Venezuelans further\". He said there would be more \"street action\" and called for a march opposing the constituent assembly to be held on Wednesday. Fifty-five people have been killed in protests since the beginning of April. The unrest was sparked by a Supreme Court ruling on 29 March stripping the National Assembly of its powers and transferring those powers to the court. The Supreme Court suspended the most controversial paragraphs three days later, but the ruling united the hitherto divided opposition and spurred them into action. The opposition says the Supreme Court ruling and Mr Maduro's call for a constituent assembly are attempts by the president to cling on to power beyond the end of his term in 2019. They say that he has become increasingly authoritarian since he was elected in 2013, blocking their attempts to hold a recall referendum and delaying elections for governors. On Tuesday, National Electoral Council head Tibisay Lucena also announced that the gubernatorial elections would be held on 10 December, a year after they were originally due.

{"article": "Army ants are a predatory nomadic species: they raid other insect colonies and are always on the move, without a permanent nest. In this lifestyle, finding the shortest foraging path - with sufficient workforce left over - is crucial. The new research shows they adjust their bridges to find that balance. Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the scientists say their findings have implications for creating intelligent, self-assembling systems. Many species of ants show many complex, collective behaviours. Fire ants form rafts, bridges and tower structures, while weaver ants in Australia build chains that \"sew\" leaves together to make nests. The American and German researchers behind the new study focussed on the army ant, Eciton hamatum. They travelled to Panama to observe this species in its natural environment, hoping \"to understand the simple rules that allow them to communicate and build the complex bridge structures\", said co-first author Matthew Lutz. The team used a 3D-printed, angled platform that mimicked the ants' natural environment but also allowed the scientists to adjust the path for their experiments. \"The ants started to form a small bridge at the tip of the angle, which then moved away, making the bridge bigger and bigger so as to shorten the path,\" explained Mr Lutz, a PhD student at Princeton University in the US. \"What was even more interesting was that the bridge didn't move as far away as it possibly could. It tended to stop at some intermediate point.\" If the angle to be bridged was wider, that \"bridge migration\" ceased even sooner. In the wild, a foraging trail contains several such bridges, and they respond to the intensity of the traffic overhead: \"If you stop the traffic across the bridge, it breaks in 1-2 minutes,\" Mr Lutz said. He and his colleagues reasoned that the ants were facing a trade-off between a shorter, faster path and the number of ants that had to be immobilised in building the structure - which would otherwise boost the community' foraging power. From a foraging perspective, the shortest path is not necessarily the most efficient one. \"This is an elegant, quantitative study of the wonderful adaptive abilities of army ants,\" commented Prof Nigel Franks, who runs an ant research lab at the University of Bristol. \"The army ants are such effective raiders that they deplete their prey as they go. They are here today, gone tomorrow. \"Using their bodies to build dynamic bridges and to cover \"potholes\" in their route makes sense to them, as opposed to spending time and energy bulldozing obstacles out of their way.\" Mr Lutz, an architect by training, is interested in self-assembling structures. \"I started doing this PhD in biology to study more specifically the structures that are formed by these ants,\" he said. Contemporary architecture and robotics are turning to natural self-assembling systems like the army ants to learn how to design and produce such dynamic structures in the future. \"In 10-15 years, this sort of stuff will be more common,\" Mr Lutz predicted. Chris Reid, his co-author on the study, expressed similar hopes. \"Artificial systems made of independent robots operating via the same principles as the army ants could build large-scale structures,\" said Dr Reid, who was working at the New Jersey Institute of Technology when the study was conducted but is now at the University of Sydney in Australia. \"Such swarms could accomplish remarkable tasks, such as creating bridges to navigate complex terrain, plugs to repair structural breaches, or supports to stabilise a failing structure.\"", "abstract": "Ants are well-known for building with their bodies, but a new study has shown that army ants can optimise traffic flow using bridges that move.", "candidate": "Scientists have used a 3D-printed platform to study an ant's ability to build bridges.", "doc_id": 3658, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "\"The ants started to form a small bridge at the tip of the angle, which then moved away, making the bridge bigger and bigger so as to shorten the path,\" explained Mr Lutz, a PhD student at Princeton University in the US.", "explanation": "This is accurate because earlier in the text the 3D Printed platform that was designed to mimic the ants natural environment was made and then after that the ants were studied on their ability to build bridges.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}
{"article": "It was opposed to the ICC trying Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta on charges of crimes against humanity, said Ethiopia's Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn. The AU would raise its concerns with the UN, he added. Mr Kenyatta, who was elected in March, is due to be tried in July. He denies the charges, which arise from accusations that he fuelled violence after disputed elections in 2007. Analysts say the charges bolstered his campaign in this year's poll, as many voters saw the trial as interference in Kenya's domestic affairs. He beat then-Prime Minister Raila Odinga by 50.07% to 43.28%, giving him a narrow victory in the first round. Speaking at the end of an AU summit in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, Mr Hailemariam said the cases of Mr Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto should be referred to the Kenyan courts. African leaders were concerned that out of those indicted by the ICC, \"99% are Africans\", Mr Hailemariam added. \"This shows something is flawed within the system of the ICC and we object to that,\" he said. The ICC had been formed more than a decade ago to end the culture of impunity, but \"now the process has degenerated into some kind of race hunting\", Mr Hailemariam said. It was \"chasing\" Mr Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto, despite the fact that the rival Kalenjin and Kikuyu ethnic groups, who had fought after the 2007 election, had come together to vote for them in the March poll, he added. \"The AU is mandated by the assembly [of the AU] to take care of this issue, to present to the UN the core of this matter,\" Mr Hailemariam said. Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto were on opposite sides in the 2007 election, after which some 1,000 people were killed and 600,000 people fled their homes. The trial of Mr Ruto, who faces similar charges as Mr Kenyatta, was due to begin this month but it has been postponed. A new date is yet to be set. The ICC insists that it acts impartially, and says it intends to press ahead with the case against Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto. Source: ICC factsheet . Kenyan lawyer Wilfred Nderitu, who represents about 150 victims of the violence, told BBC Focus on Africa he was concerned about the safety of witnesses if Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto were tried in local courts. He also doubted whether Kenya's judiciary was capable of dealing with such complex cases, he said. \"A lot of judges don't have an international criminal justice background. Therefore, the technical expertise will be lacking,\" Mr Nderitu told BBC Focus on Africa. Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir attended the summit, in defiance of an ICC warrant for his arrest. It was unreasonable for the UN Security Council to refer Mr Bashir to the ICC when three of its five permanent members - the United States, Russia and China - had either not signed up to or not ratified the Rome Statute which established the ICC, said AU Peace and Security Council head Ramtane Lamamra, Reuters news agency reports. \"How could you refer the cases of others while you don't feel compelled to abide by the same rule?\" he is quoted as saying. The ICC has charged Mr Bashir with genocide over the conflict in Darfur. He denies the charge, and accuses the ICC of being a tool of Western powers. Around 300,000 people are estimated to have died in Darfur since 2003, according to the UN. Earlier this month, Kenya's government wrote to the UN Security Council, asking for Mr Kenyatta's and Mr Ruto's trials be halted. The prosecution was \"neither impartial nor independent\", said the letter, signed by Kenya's UN Ambassador Macharia Kamau. Mr Kenyatta and Mr Ruto were the \"glue\" that held the country together during the March poll, the letter added. The UN Security Council is able to defer ICC cases for up to 12 months.

Raikkonen pitted five laps before Vettel and came out behind slower cars, which he had to pass. Meanwhile, on a clear track, Vettel began setting fastest times and by the time he stopped he had made up enough time to emerge in the lead.

{"article": "The exhibition called Metamorphosis is divided into seven ages, which is a reference to the \"Seven Ages of Man\" speech from the play As You Like It. Visitors to the university's Senate House Library can see some of the sources of inspiration for Shakespeare's plays and sonnets. They can also examine his four folios and consider how he became such a cultural giant, the world over. When Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616 there were no officially recognised versions of his plays or sonnets, Senate House librarian Jackie Marfleet said. The first time his works were collected together and published as a printed volume (folio) was in 1623. The first folio is believed to be based on play manuscripts and memories of his performances. By 1685 a fourth edition had been published with some 3,251 changes from the original, aimed at making his work easier to read for a wider audience. Modern scholarship now suggests seven plays contained in the third and fourth folios were not in fact penned by Shakespeare. Towards the end of the 18th Century, Samuel Johnson, author of the Dictionary of the English Language, produced his own edition of the Plays of William Shakespeare that included details of Shakespeare's will. It also elevated the importance of the first folio which he said was closest to the author's original text. Meanwhile on stage, Shakespeare's plays were being purged of regional accents and were held up as \"a paragon of phonetic propriety\". The practice contributed to the establishment of a standard English accent, Sonia Massai, professor of Shakespeare studies at Kings College London said. In print, Victorian readers became acquainted with illustrations by John Gilbert which brought to life many scenes that had not been sketched before. He illustrated other renowned literary works but his Shakespeare illustrations earned him by far the greatest fame. As Shakespeare's fame grew, collectors sought to buy editions of his books primarily to display, as opposed to read. Ernest Nister's edition of A Midsummer Night's Dream in 1888 was produced on pages as thick as cardboard with 28 sepia illustrations and gilt edges. His appeal has endured and modern audiences can access Shakespeare online. A first folio was found in St Omer, northern France, in 2014 and has been digitized to give free access to all.

Officials and residents of Saint-Quentin-Fallavier gathered outside the town hall on Saturday morning to observe a minute's silence. Mr Salhi was arrested at the Air Products factory on Friday morning. Later, anti-terror police searched the apartment of Mr Salhi, a father-of-three, in the Moines neighbourhood of the town. They took his wife and sister into custody. Another man was arrested but released without charge. Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor's office, has said police have so far not found any motive or possible foreign connection, and that Mr Salhi is not speaking to investigators. Under French anti-terrorism laws, suspects can be held for up to four days before either being released or charged. Yassin Salhi had been investigated in the past about his alleged links with Islamist militants. It is alleged he was waved through the gates of the factory because he was a regular delivery driver. Police and firefighters later found a half-destroyed car which had been rammed into canisters containing chemicals and a man trying to ignite more. Mr Salhi's boss, a 54-year-old man whose name has not been released by police, was found beheaded at the scene. His head had been placed on the factory railings. It is not clear when he died.

{"article": "The senator from South Carolina told CBS This Morning that he would make an official announcement on 1 June in his home town of Central. But when asked why he was considering it, he said \"I'm running\" because \"the world is falling apart\" and he would make the best commander-in-chief. He becomes the seventh leading Republican to join a crowded field. Mr Graham has been a fierce critic of President Barack Obama's foreign policy, particularly in the Middle East. He wants US ground troops to be sent into Iraq and Syria to combat Islamic State, to prevent terror attacks in the US. Lindsey Graham tried to be coy about whether he was going to run for president, but his decision is clear - he's in. That makes four members of the US Senate - 9% of all Republican senators in office in 2014 - now running.

When asked by CBS whether he thought the Republican field was weak, he revealed his intention to run himself. \"I'm running because of what you see on television, I'm running because I think the world is falling apart, I've been more right than wrong on foreign policy,\" he said. \"It's not the fault of others, or their lack of this or that that makes me want to run, it's my ability in my own mind to be a good commander-in-chief and to make Washington work.\" Meet the 2016 hopefuls .", "abstract": "Senator Lindsey Graham, the Republican foreign policy hawk, has confirmed that he will run for US president in 2016.", "candidate": "Republican Senator Lindsey Graham has confirmed he will run for president in 2016.", "doc_id": 2698, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "Lindsey Graham tried to be coy about whether he was going to run for president, but his decision is clear - he's in.", "explanation": "it correctly pulls the info (name, GOP, 2016, president) from the source text", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

It is the second day of flight disruptions due to continued eruptions from Mount Raung. Some of those affected by the Bali closure have been speaking to the BBC about their situation: . Erika Fitzgerald, who was on holiday in Bali, said she was due to start a new job near Sydney on Monday but will not make it back in time. \"My main concern at the moment is getting back for that,\" she said. Instead of flying direct, she is now trying to get on a flight to Singapore on Saturday then three connecting flight back to Sydney. \"If we hadn't taken the four flight option we wouldn't have been able to get back till Sunday 19 [July],\" she said. Janan Jedrzejewski said she had booked a Bali villa with a private pool as part of a post-breakup retreat. \"I wanted to go get my nails done and get mud baths and go back looking fabulous,\" she said. But when she arrived at the airport on Thursday night Jetstar staff told her the flight had been cancelled. \"I used to work for the airlines so take in my stride, [it's] better safe than sorry, but I'm trying to cancel my villa,\" Ms Jedrzejewski told the BBC. Jake Powell said he managed to get back to Australia but his parents are stuck in Bali for another 10 days and may not be able to make a claim for the delay through their travel insurance. \"[Mum] was supposed to fly back tonight to Sydney and catch a connecting flight to Newcastle so I could pick her and Dad up tomorrow at 1pm,\" Jake told the BBC. Wendy Robertson, 78, was hoping to return from Bali feeling relaxed, but has instead been stuck with little information about when she and her eight-year-old grand-daughter, Ashley, will get home. \"I have run out of my medications for blood pressure and diabetes,\" she told Fairfax. \"I have to take them every day, I only brought a supply for six days. \"I am in a hiatus.

The engine, which retired from service in 1963, has been restored for the NRM in a decade-long, \u00a34.2m refit. On Saturday it ventured on to the mainline network for the first time in 40 years as it took a test run through Cumbria and Lancashire.

{"article": "Sheikh Nimr Baqir al-Nimr's brother said he was found guilty of seeking \"foreign meddling\" in the kingdom, \"disobeying\" its rulers and taking up arms against the security forces. The cleric was a vocal supporter of the mass anti-government protests that erupted in Eastern Province in 2011. His arrest two years ago, during which he was shot, triggered days of unrest. Oil-rich Eastern Province is home to a Shia majority that has long complained of marginalisation at the hands of the Sunni royal family. Protests began there in February 2011 after the start of the pro-democracy uprising in neighbouring Bahrain, which has a Shia majority and a Sunni royal family. The Saudi authorities deny discriminating against Shia and blame Iran for stirring up discontent. Sheikh Nimr's brother Mohammed said on Twitter that he had been sentenced to death by Riyadh's Specialised Criminal Court, which tries terrorism cases, on Wednesday morning. A statement by the cleric's family described the verdict as \"discretionary\", saying the judge had the option of imposing a lighter sentence, according to the Associated Press. It also warned that the trial had been \"political\" and had set a \"dangerous precedent for decades to come\". When Sheikh Nimr, who holds the rank of ayatollah, went on trial in March 2013 prosecutors called for his execution by \"crucifixion\", a punishment which in Saudi Arabia involves beheading followed by public display of the decapitated body. Human rights groups expressed concern at the time that he would not receive a fair trial. They also said he had still not been given access to adequate medical care for the gunshot wounds he received during his arrest in July 2012, something denied by the authorities. Police shot Sheikh Nimr in the leg four times in disputed circumstances as they detained him after a car chase in Eastern Province's Qatif district. Officials said he rammed a security forces vehicle, leading to a gun battle. However, his family disputed the allegation that he resisted arrest and insisted that he did not own a weapon. The cleric was held for eight months before being charged and reportedly spent the first four in an isolation cell at a prison hospital in Riyadh. Activists and relatives say Sheikh Nimr, who has a wide following among Shia in Eastern Province and other states, supported only peaceful protests and eschewed all violent opposition to the government. In 2011, he told the BBC that he supported \"the roar of the word against authorities rather than weapons... the weapon of the word is stronger than bullets, because authorities will profit from a battle of weapons\". His arrest prompted days of protests in which three people were killed. Human Rights Watch said more than 1,040 people had been arrested at Shia protests between February 2011 and August 2014. At least 240 are still believed to be in detention. \"I think the message that Saudis are saying is: 'We will arrest anybody. We don't care how high profile they are... nobody is above this. We don't have any tolerance. We don't have any flexibility,'\" HRW Middle East researcher Adam Coogle told AP after Sheikh Nimr's sentencing.", "abstract": "A court in Saudi Arabia has sentenced the Shia cleric Sheikh Nimr Baqir al-Nimr to death, his family says.", "candidate": "A prominent Shia Muslim cleric in Saudi Arabia has been sentenced to death for terrorism, his family says.", "doc_id": 2641, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "A prominent Shia Muslim cleric in Saudi Arabia has been sentenced to death, his family says.", "evidence": "Sheikh Nimr's brother Mohammed said on Twitter that he had been sentenced to death by Riyadh's Specialised Criminal Court, which tries terrorism cases, on Wednesday morning.", "explanation": "it makes up that he was sentenced to death for terrorism", "instruction": "Remove the information about him being sentenced to death for terrorism from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about him being sentenced to death for terrorism from the summary."]}}

This is not the first incident of its kind in Kerala: the famous Sabarimala temple banned fireworks in 1952 after 68 people died in a firecracker explosion.

{"article": "She found overnight fame on the sketch comedy series, and spent two years being doused with water every time she said the phrase \"Sock it to me!\". Carne was also known for her tumultuous relationship with actor Burt Reynolds, to whom she was married from 1963-65. The Northampton-born actress died on 3 September, reported The Telegraph. Carne's other TV credits included appearances in The Man from Uncle, Juke Box Jury, sitcoms The Rag Trade and Fair Exchange, and the 1962 comedy film A Pair of Briefs. The actress detailed her relationship with Reynolds in her 1985 autobiography Laughing on the Outside, Crying on the Inside: The Bittersweet Saga of the Sock-It-To-Me Girl. In the book she confessed to several affairs and also described her long struggle with drug addiction. When she and Reynolds met she said they \"were immediately in love, so we immediately made love\", but they divorced in 1966, with Carne claiming the actor had become abusive. The actress - who was born Joyce Audrey Botterill on 27 April 1939 - was brought up in Kingsthorpe, Northamptonshire, where her parents ran a greengrocer's shop. She was a popular figure during her time on Laugh-In, but quit the show in the middle of the third series - around the same time Goldie Hawn emerged as the show's female star - complaining that it had become \"a bore\". Carne once described herself as \"a 1960s flowerchild who has refused to grow up. Mature and responsible are words I don't understand,\" she said. During her lifetime she talked of relationships with several well known figures including Vidal Sassoon, Stirling Moss, the actor Anthony Newley, Steve McQueen and Warren Beatty - as well as a \"meaningful relationship with a woman for a year and a half\".

{"article": "In a statement, Pyongyang warned that South Korea's ultimatum would \"lead to no good results\". On Thursday, Seoul gave the North 24 hours to agree to talks on the Kaesong Industrial Complex, warning of \"grave measures\" if its offer was ignored. South Korea's president later held a meeting with top officials to discuss next steps, Yonhap reported. The stoppage was taking a heavy toll on South Korean firms, the agency quoted her as saying. A statement from the Unification Ministry was expected shortly, a separate report said. North-South tensions are high following Pyongyang's nuclear test in February and the subsequent imposition of expanded UN sanctions. The Kaesong complex, launched in 2003 as a sign of North-South co-operation, is located just inside North Korea. It is the biggest contributor to inter-Korean trade and provides the North with much-needed hard currency. Q&A: Kaesong Industrial Complex . Analysis: The North Korea threat . Missile defences in the region . Picking apart the bluster . But Pyongyang blocked South Korean access to the site and pulled out its 53,000 workers earlier this month, amid a series of threats and strong rhetoric from the communist state. \"Pyongyang will be the first to take tough action if the South insists on worsening the situation at the border town,\" North Korea's National Defense Commission said in a statement. \"The kind of ultimatum made by the South the day before will only lead to no good results\". The remaining 175 South Koreans still in the complex are believed to be running out of food and medicines, because the North has refused to allow fresh supplies from the South into the industrial park. The South Korean government has refused to spell out what measures it may take, but there is speculation that it may be considering pulling out its remaining citizens, the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Seoul reports.

But Holland then dismissed Byrom, James Hildreth, Tom Abell and Steven Davies in a remarkable four-over spell of 4-8. He ran out Lewis Gregory before Gareth Berg (3-26) claimed two wickets, then rain forced an early close at 135-8. Somerset came into the day in a commanding position, having triggered a similar collapse from Hampshire with the pink ball under the floodlights in their first innings. However, the poor middle-order batting that has undermined their County Championship season came back to haunt them, meaning a first win of the season is now very unlikely. Opener Byrom, who had looked otherwise solid, chipped USA-born Australian Holland to mid-on and Hildreth went lbw for two before Abell and Davies feathered edges to Lewis McManus, both without scoring. Gregory was run out by Holland when he slipped trying to run a quick single, leaving Berg to pin Hose lbw and have Craig Overton caught at mid-wicket before rain prevented any play in the final session. Ian Holland told BBC Radio Solent: . \"It was a strange session of cricket. Obviously they had the momentum early and they got a decent partnership but we got a load of wickets in a hurry, so it's a decent end for us. \"It puts us in a strong position. You never know.

Plaid said costs could be passed on to parents - which is denied by the council. Caerphilly said it was one proposal as part of a drive to save \u00a39m in 2016/17. A spokeswoman said \"extensive consultation\" had taken place with head teachers, adding: \"There is certainly no intention that any financial impact would be passed onto parents, or that the service would cease to be provided by schools.\" The Labour-run authority said it was committed to spending an extra \u00a31.9m on county borough schools in 2016.17. A cabinet report set to be discussed next week says the 75 schools may decide to use their lunch-time supervisor to undertake the cleaning task. However, if this happened, 75 posts (working on average one hour per day) would be withdrawn in \"a worst case scenario\". This would amount to 375 hours of cleaning lost across all schools per week and the work would be shared among the remaining staff. Plaid Cymru said the proposal would save the council \u00a3175,000 a year, which equated to around \u00a32,200 being passed onto each school. It added that it would be based on how many pupils eat sandwiches.

Aspell, who won in 2014 aboard Pineau De Re, steered his 25-1 shot to the front three fences from home and then held off the challenge of Saint Are to win by a length and three-quarters. Monbeg Dude finished third and Alvarado came in fourth. Aspell, 38, becomes the first jockey since Brian Fletcher on Red Rum in 1973 and 1974 to win back-to-back Nationals, while it was a third success for 79-year-old owner Trevor Hemmings, who has previously won with Hedgehunter and Ballabriggs. Aspell said: \"It was wonderful and we will certainly celebrate tonight. I asked some big questions, but he dug deep. \"We really refreshed and recharged his battery and I tried to conserve energy. He is all heart. All season, he has had hard races. Win lose or draw, that's the best ride I have had in the National. I just hoped his battery life lasted out and it did.\" McCoy appeared well placed in the latter stages, but Shutthefrontdoor tired badly from the elbow. \"I thought from the third-last fence I was running on empty,\" McCoy said. \"I will miss riding horses and races like that. I thought for a long way he could win. It was my last National but was a very enjoyable one.\" The Northern Irishman had said he would retire immediately if he had won, but the 40-year-old could now race on until the Sandown meeting at the end of April. Winning trainer Oliver Sherwood was in tears after his decision to run Many Clouds was vindicated. The eight-year-old was a disappointing sixth in last month's Cheltenham Gold Cup after winning the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury in November and scoring at Cheltenham in January. Many Clouds becomes the youngest winner of the National since Bindaree in 2002 and at 11st 9lb, the heaviest winner since Red Rum. He also won \u00a3561,300 for Hemmings out of a total prize fund of \u00a31m. About 72,000 spectators turned out on a sunny day at Aintree to watch the 168th running of the National. McCoy had been strongly backed in the lead-up to the race - with more money wagered on this National than any other horse race - and bookmakers had feared a \u00a350m pay-out if he had claimed his second victory over the 30 National fences.

{"article": "Paul Thomas, from Telford, was jailed for 10 years in April for the manslaughter of his son Oliver Sargent. Oliver's mother Ashlea was convicted of causing or allowing his death. The infant could have been removed from his home had the abuse been recognised earlier, the review concluded. Oliver's parents, whose relationship was described in the report as \"unstable\", took him to the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford on four occasions. He was was seen by a number of doctors there and one questioned if the injuries could have been non-accidental, but another, a consultant, accepted Oliver's mother's claim that he was a \"very active child who rolled on to toys\". The report, which refers to Oliver as Child B, stated: \"Although there is no guarantee, there is a probability that had health professionals been clearer in recognising that there was no plausible explanation for the injuries, Child B would have been subjected to child protection procedures and consideration given to protecting Child B by removing them from the home. \"Health professionals were in a position to raise concerns when Child B was observed to have bruising and occipital swelling. \"The parents either gave no explanation for the bruising or the explanation was questionable.\" Oliver died in hospital on 27 July 2012, five days after sustaining a skull fracture during an assault. His injuries were consistent with shaking. He was not previously known to social care services or police, the report said. Jurors at Birmingham Crown Court were told at his parents' trial that Oliver had injuries consistent with a 40mph car crash. A post-mortem examination showed he had 13 separate marks on his body and face and had been subjected to at least one impact to the left side of his head. Further medical investigations discovered historical injuries, including two fractured ribs and a broken collarbone, all of which had healed. Paul Thomas was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter, while Ashlea Thomas was cleared of both murder and manslaughter. She was given a two-year jail term, suspended for two years, for causing or allowing her son's death. The report set out a number of recommendations for agencies. It said Shropshire Community Health Trust (SCHT) responses to bruising seen in young children must be improved, consideration should be given to seeing a child's father and injuries should not be seen in isolation, but considered with other concerns. In cases where a child has life-threatening injuries out of office hours, senior managers of children's social care should be alerted. The review noted poor quality in recording of injuries at Princess Royal Hospital and a lack of consideration of previous admission and/or injuries.

Shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn accused Mr Hammond of \"scaremongering\". Steve Symonds of Amnesty International UK described Mr Hammond's \"mean-spirited response\" as \"shameful\". \"Rather than throwing up the drawbridge and talking about how Europe can 'protect' itself from migrants, Mr Hammond should be working with our EU partners to ensure that people don't drown in the Mediterranean or get crushed beneath lorries at Calais,\" he said. Mr Benn added that Mr Hammond should \"think more carefully about what he says\". \"We need responsibility and international leadership from this government, not scaremongering,\" he said. \"Those fleeing Syria are desperate refugees from a country being torn apart by war.\" Speaking during a visit to Singapore, Mr Hammond said: \"So long as the European Union's laws are the way they are, many of them will only have to set foot in Europe to be pretty confident that they will never be returned to their country of origin. \"Now, that is not a sustainable situation because Europe can't protect itself and preserve its standard of living and social infrastructure, if it has to absorb millions of migrants from Africa.\" He said the problem had to ultimately be resolved by being able to return those who are not entitled to claim asylum back to their countries of origin - something Mr Hammond described as \"our number one priority\". This, he added, was key to resolving the \"crisis\" at Calais, where thousands are gathered in the hope of crossing the Channel into the UK.

{"article": "With more than 40 firms now offering gas and electricity deals it warns of the danger of one becoming insolvent. At present anyone who is in credit with their energy supplier could lose out. The watchdog wants the cost of a safety net to be paid for by customers, which would have \"a small impact on bills\", it said. Ofgem's senior partner for consumers and competition, Rachel Fletcher, said: \"\"We are proposing a safety net to protect customers' credit balances in the unlikely event of a supplier failure.\" Under current rules, if a gas or electricity supplier becomes insolvent Ofgem appoints a replacement to ensure that customers continue to be supplied with energy. But it warns that \"there may be financial implications for the failed supplier's customers\". That is because as direct debit energy payments spread the cost evenly across the year, customers are often in debit during the winter and build up credit in the summer. Ofgem reckons that a typical customer's credit balance peaks at a little over \u00c2\u00a3100 each year. But it warns that without regulatory intervention, customers are unlikely to receive all - or possibly any - of their money back if their supplier fails. Some industries already have a financial safety net for consumers. If a financial services firm goes bust, for instance, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme protects people's savings with authorised firms up to \u00c2\u00a375,000. The scheme is paid for by a levy on all financial services companies. Meanwhile if a travel company collapses, customers are protected if it was a member of travel trade association ABTA. The scheme is funded through a bond on members. Ofgem wants similar protection for energy customers and is proposing to allow, on a case-by-case basis, the costs of reimbursing credit balances to be spread across all energy customers. \"This would better protect customers' money and have a small impact on bills,\" it said. The watchdog was keen to stress that it does not expect any suppliers to go out of business. \"These proposals are for reassurance and to give customers the confidence to shop around and get the best energy deal,\" Ms Fletcher said. But it points out that while competition benefits consumers, it can lead to suppliers to fail in the same way as companies can in other markets.

Andorra and Israel did not have correct rules in place. Drug testing will continue, but it will be carried out independently and the country in question will foot the bill. This will continue until the country reinstalls quality anti-doping programmes. Wada cannot prevent athletes from \"non-compliant\" countries competing - such a decision is taken by organisations such as the IAAF and International Olympic Committee. Russia's athletics federation is already provisionally banned from international competition for its alleged involvement in widespread doping. The IAAF imposed the sanction after a Wada independent commission report accused the country of \"state-sponsored doping\". The head of the Russian doping laboratory accused by the Wada report of destroying more than 1,400 blood and urine samples, has left his position, and the laboratory has had its accreditation suspended. Media playback is not supported on this device . However, the report's co-author Dick Pound said it would be \"child's play\" for Russian athletics and Rusada - the country's anti-doping organisation - to meet the conditions in time to compete in Rio. \"I don't think you'll get the culture fixed in nine months but you can do actions that will come to the same result,\" Pound said. \"In a sense, I don't care whether you're there with clean athletes if the only reason is fear of getting caught, as opposed to thinking that's the right thing to do. Listen, Russia built Sochi in seven years. This is child's play.\" The country's Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said Russian athletics will co-operate \"in any way\" to prove it is clean. Pound's report stated Russia was not the only country with anti-doping issues, and that athletics was not the only sport with those problems. Pound also alleged Kenya has a \"real problem with doping\". However, during a two-day meeting in Colorado Springs in the United States, Wada said it was \"encouraged\" by reports the Kenyan government is committing funding to its national anti-doping programme. Last week, the country approved the immediate establishment of an anti-doping agency. The government said the new agency will carry out testing and ensure compliance with doping rules. The head of Kenya's Olympic committee, Kipchoge Keino, has accused his government of complacency. Travis Tygart, chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, said athletics is \"at a crossroads\" and declared the current investigation is the biggest since Wada was formed in 1999. \"We have to decide,\" he told BBC Sport. \"Are we going to end up regulating ourselves to be a toothless bureaucracy or are we going to roll up our sleeves and get into the field of play and win this fight for clean athletes? The eyes of the clean athletes are watching. \"I don't think we have seen something on this scale since Wada took over. It far eclipses anything we have seen from corruption and impacts on the rights of clean athletes. It is why it is so important. \"We, as the world anti-doping community, have to step up for them and support their decision to do it the right way or we might as well walk away and throw in the towel and quit the charade.\"", "abstract": "Russia is one of six countries ruled to be in breach of the World Anti-Doping Agency's codes.", "candidate": "Russia is one of six countries facing sanctions from the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).", "doc_id": 1536, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "Russia is one of six countries found to be \"non-compliant\" by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada).", "evidence": "Wada cannot prevent athletes from \"non-compliant\" countries competing - such a decision is taken by organisations such as the IAAF and International Olympic Committee.", "explanation": "The summary is incorrect because it has misinterpreted That WADA imposes santions. \"Wada cannot prevent athletes from \"non-compliant\" countries competing - such a decision is taken by organisations such as the IAAF and International Olympic Committee.\" .

{"article": "That is the warning in a report from economists at the World Bank. But there are some more upbeat aspects of their assessment. They don't reject the idea that this might just be a temporary soft patch. And they say emerging economies are not as vulnerable as they were in previous decades. The starting point for this report is the marked slowdown in growth that has already taken place in the emerging market economies since 2010. They have grown more slowly than the five years before the international financial crisis. By last year, the growth rate had slipped below the long-term average. China is the most high-profile example and in a way it's a special case. A slowdown there was seen as inevitable after three decade of rapid economic expansion. But many others in this group have also seen their performance weaken including Brazil, Russia and South Africa. (India is something of an exception.) Their slowdown contrasts with a weak but steady recovery in the advanced economies. The central question posed by the report is whether this is a temporary problem or the beginning of a new era of slower growth. There is no definitive answer in this report, but there is a clear sense of unease that it might be the latter, less attractive of the two possibilities. Some of the factors behind the slowdown are likely to be persistent. Many are affected by sliding prices of commodities such as metals and oil. There has also been weaker demand in export markets for their products, which in turn partly reflects what the report calls \"anaemic growth in the advanced economies\". International trade is likely to stay weak as the rich countries' recovery remains hesitant. Large investments in commodity production in recent years are likely to mean strong supplies which will keep downward pressure on prices. Some, especially oil exporters, have seen a deterioration in government finances as tax revenue has fallen sharply. There also been a marked decline in foreign investment going into emerging economies. It fell by about a quarter between 2010 and 2014. In the first part of 2015 there was a marked increase in capital leaving the emerging economies. There are also domestic factors, including aging populations in many emerging economies. The growth in productivity - the amount that each worker produces - has slowed in many. The report describes the slowdown as \"unusually synchronous (affecting many countries at the same time) and protracted\". Looking, ahead the report notes the prospect of higher borrowing costs as the US Federal Reserve is expected to start raising interest rates - widely expected to begin as soon as next week. That is likely to lead also to a stronger dollar. That makes money borrowed in dollars more expensive to repay and the amount of foreign currency debt has increased from 30% of emerging economies' national income in 2007 to 36% last year. Declining currencies could also cause an inflation problem - they make imports more costly. There are clearly some reasons to be concerned. But the World Bank's economists also emphasise how these countries have changed compared with the 1980s and 90s. They have reduced debt and inflation levels, diversified their economies (they are less dependent on specific industries and so less in danger if those industries get into difficulty). And they have improved their economic policies. What should they do? There is no one-size-fits-all. Those who can afford to spend more on infrastructure (transport, telecommunications, energy) would benefit from doing so. There's a call for continued efforts to improve the climate for business, make labour markets more effective, tackle corruption and improve the efficiency of government. Much of this is frankly advice the Bank would give to most countries most of the time. So no hard conclusions here.

However, there was no evidence injuries that caused his death could have been anticipated, a safeguarding board said. But it said staff were not questioning enough of the \"concerning history\" given by his parents. Read more news for Birmingham and the Black Country . The review looked at two visits to New Cross Hospital's emergency unit by Joshua with Sanzone and the baby's mother, Zoe Howell, before the fatal shaking incident at their home in Pendeford. Sanzone's trial had heard a nurse and a junior doctor assessed Joshua and found no swelling and no pain but later bone experts suggested he had suffered some leg fractures at this point. However, the review found the fracture would have been very hard to identify in a baby so small and no X-ray was taken.

{"article": "Finance Minister Jane Hutt told AMs the 2016/17 draft budget backed Labour's \"priorities for Wales and its future\". Total health spending rises by 4.1% while education and skills goes up by 1.1%, but local government faces a cut of 2%. The Conservatives said the spending plans offered \"too little, far too late for our hardworking NHS staff\". Ms Hutt said the Welsh government had faced a 3.6% cut in UK government funding over five years, once the effects of inflation were taken into account. About \u00a3260m will go on day-to-day, or revenue, funding for the NHS and another \u00a333m will be spent on infrastructure, maintaining the NHS estate and equipment. There will, however, be a reduction of \u00a315m from other parts of the health budget, giving a net figure for the NHS of \u00a3278m. Although the education and skills funding is getting an increase, the body which funds Welsh universities said its budget was being cut by \u00a341m, nearly a third of the total. The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales had already warned not enough money was available to Welsh universities, because of the way tuition fees are funded. Boosts to the Communities, Economy and Natural Resources budgets are largely made up of capital spending increases, for example housing and flood defence projects. Their day-to-day, or revenue, budgets, are being cut. Ms Hutt said her aim was to protect the services that mattered most to people, within the financial constraints. \"It has been another challenging settlement which has been set against the backdrop of successive real terms cuts to our Budget over the last five years,\" she said. \"We have continued our record investment in health with more than a quarter of a billion pounds going to the Welsh NHS in 2016-17 - demonstrating our wider approach to the health and social care and the value of preventative spend.\" The lion's share of the Welsh government's total expenditure of \u00a315.9bn comes from the UK Treasury, apart from about \u00a31bn raised in business rates. Almost half of the budget is spent on health, which has seen above-inflation increases since October 2013, when the Welsh government reversed its controversial decision not to protect the NHS budget between 2011 and 2013. Conservative Shadow Finance Minister Nick Ramsay said Labour's latest budget boost for health could not make up for previous cuts to NHS funding. \"Hospital downgrading, huge delays in waiting times, a failure to recruit staff; this chaos is a direct result of Labour's record-breaking NHS budget cuts,\" he said. \"By failing to protect the budget, our health service has been starved of \u00a31bn since 2010/11.\" However, Plaid Cymru AM Alun Ffred Jones \"warmly welcomed\" the extra NHS cash. \"I do very much hope that this will enable waiting lists to be substantially reduced, in light of the harsh criticism of the Royal College of Surgeons in their statement yesterday,\" he said. Liberal Democrat Peter Black highlighted an extra \u00a31,150 each school would receive for every pupil eligible for free school meals, as part of a two year deal his party had struck with Labour ministers in 2014.

The 26-year-old French national was born in Brussels and lived there before the Paris attacks. He would be held in solitary confinement in a maximum-security prison in the Paris area, said Justice Minister Jean-Jacques Urvoas. The co-ordinated attacks carried out by so-called Islamic State in Paris on 13 November claimed 130 lives and left dozens more severely wounded. Belgium's federal prosecutor said Salah Abdeslam had been \"surrendered to the French authorities this morning (in execution of the European Arrest Warrant issued by France on 19 March 2016)\". He was then formally placed under arrest. Although he was initially held at a prison in Bruges, he had most recently been in custody at a high-security jail at Beveren, near Antwerp. Salah Abdeslam is charged in France with participation in terrorist murder and the activities of a terrorist organisation. He was also indicted by Belgian authorities last week over a shoot-out in the Forest area of Brussels in which four police were wounded, three days before he was arrested. Earlier, French criminal lawyer Frank Berton told French media that he would be taking on Salah Abdeslam's defence in France following a two-and-a-half-hour meeting between the two last Friday at Beveren. Mr Berton BFMTV (in French) he hoped the man would be judged \"for what he has done and not what he has not done... not for what he represents because he is the last survivor\". Most of the Paris attackers are now dead. Frank Berton has defended some high-profile clients in recent years: . Florence Cassez, a Frenchwoman jailed in Mexico in 2007 for 60 years for kidnapping but controversially freed in 2013. She is alleged to have been part of the Zodiacs gang . Dominique Cottrez, sentenced to nine years in prison in 2015 for killing eight of her newborn babies .

Mr Berton described Salah Abdeslam as \"falling apart because of the drama that unfolded in France\" and said he wanted to explain his actions. He said he was aware of the risks in representing his client, but insisted \"he has the right to a fair trial\". Mr Abdeslam's Belgian lawyer, Sven Mary, has spoken of the dangers he faced in representing him - telling France's Liberation website (in French) that he was threatened, assaulted physically and verbally in his office, and that on occasion police had escorted his daughters to school.

{"article": "The claim: Prime Minister Theresa May says there is no turning back from the triggering of Article 50, which starts the process of leaving the EU. Reality Check verdict: The government is clear that it respects the result of the referendum, so it argues that any debate is theoretical. However, the question of whether Article 50 is irrevocable is the subject of legal dispute. As a result, the UK government has been unable to make any definitive legal statements on the issue. The Justice Secretary, Liz Truss, has said \"My understanding is that it is irrevocable,\" while the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, said in December 2016: \"Is it irrevocable? I don't know.\" In the recent UK Supreme Court case on Article 50, both sides assumed that it was irrevocable and the court judgement concluded: \"We are content to proceed on the basis that that is correct, without expressing any view of our own.\" So this is not an issue that has been formally tested in a UK court. But European Council President Donald Tusk has said that he believes Article 50 can be reversed. When asked if the UK could unilaterally withdraw its Article 50 notification during the next two years, he said, \"Formally, legally, yes.\" Lord Kerr - the former British ambassador to the EU, who helped draft Article 50 - agreed. \"You can change your mind while the process is going on,\" he said. He acknowledged that this might annoy the rest of the EU, and be seen as a huge waste of time. \"They might try to extract a political price,\" Lord Kerr said, \"but legally they couldn't insist that you leave.\" The distinction between political and legal opinion on this issue is critical. The politics might become way too complicated if the UK tried to change its mind. But who might have the final legal say on what could yet become a critical question? Article 50 is a piece of European law, so the ultimate arbiter on this issue is the European Court of Justice. There is an ongoing case in Dublin at the moment that is seeking to refer the question of irrevocability to the European Court to get a definitive answer. One other point is worth bearing in mind: everyone is talking about a two-year period for negotiating under Article 50, at the end of which the UK would leave the EU. But Article 50 does provide for that two-year period to be extended, if all 28 EU countries, including the UK, agreed. No-one is advocating that, but it remains a legal possibility. The argument that Article 50 cannot be reversed once it has been triggered has not been tested in court. The rest of the EU has said it does not want the UK to leave, but - politically speaking - it would be very difficult to revoke notification of Article 50, and the current UK government says it has no intention of doing so.

{"article": "It came as figures obtained by BBC Radio Wales showed 15% of medical positions were vacant or filled by temporary staff. In the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, one in 10 of the medical staff positions were vacant. The Welsh government said there were difficulties recruiting A&E doctors. BBC Radio Wales submitted Freedom of Information requests to the seven boards in Wales asking about staff levels for consultants, doctors and nurses. All responded for the 11 months to August 2013 and showed that all the A&E wards were regularly operating below agreed staff levels. The worst was Aneurin Bevan University Health Board in south east Wales, where one in 10 of the medical staff positions were vacant. In the Hywel Dda Health Board in south west Wales, a quarter of the A&E staff were temporary. The chair of College of Emergency Medicine Mark Poulden called the issue in Wales a \"vacancy staffing crisis\". \"Over the last year or 18 months we have seen a change. We've essentially reached a tipping point in our staffing levels. Some departments you cannot deliver what you want to for patients,\" he said. \"Sometimes you can't deliver the quality and certain times we can't deliver the safety we require either which can be difficult.\" Across Wales, more than 15% or almost one in seven positions at A&Es were either vacant or being filled by temporary staff. However the average NHS vacancy rate was more than 5% which is less than the English NHS rate of 9%. In September the Auditor General for Wales identified a deterioration of care at A&Es. Nicola Davis-Job, who represents A&E nurses for the Royal College of Nursing, said: \"If you have a nurse down on your shift and nobody to fill that the patient care level it doesn't go down, it just means that the nurses have less time to spend with each patient. \"You have to choose which patients that you're going to care for and that's not something that nurses like to do. \"They feel they should give dignified care to all those patients on their shift.\" Responding to the figures, the Welsh government said: \"While just over 96% of all medical and dental posts are filled, demonstrating we do not have a general recruitment problem, there are geographical hotspots and recruitment difficulties in some specialities... \"If we want senior A&E doctors present for more hours of the week, we will only achieve this if we stop spreading them so thinly and focus their working in fewer centres.\" Health Minister Mark Drakeford added: \"Right across the United Kingdom there is a shortage of senior doctors to work in A&E departments and Wales is no exception.\" He told BBC Radio Wales that the NHS in Wales was being overhauled, including A&E care in an attempt to prevent such issues arising. \"The problems of recruitment don't go away by reorganisation but they become more manageable because you are able to concentrate your forces,\" he said.

{"article": "The hit show about the life of one of America's founding fathers just fell short of The Producers' record of 12 statuettes in 2001. For the first time at the ceremony, all four musical acting winners were black, including British star Cynthia Erivo. But Saturday's mass shooting in an Orlando gay club overshadowed the show, and many paid tribute to the victims. Host James Corden dedicated the night in New York to celebrating the diversity of Broadway, saying: \"Our hearts go out to all of those affected by this atrocity. All we can say is you're not on your own right now. Your tragedy is our tragedy. \"Hate will never win. Tonight's show stands as a symbol and a celebration of that principle.\" Corden won a Tony Award in 2012 for his performance in One Man, Two Guvnors. US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle introduced the cast of Hamilton, which had 16 nominations, with a video message at the ceremony. The president said it was \"not only a smash hit but a civics lesson our kids can't get enough of\", while rapper Common described the show as a \"cultural phenomenon\". It won awards including best musical, best director, best original score and best book of a musical for the spoken, non-sung dialogue and storyline. The cast changed their performance in the light of the Orlando shooting, which killed 50 people and wounded 53, leaving their prop guns behind when they took to the stage. Hamilton, which won the Pulitzer Prize for drama earlier this year, has been hailed as \"a landmark American musical\", garnering celebrity fans including Star Wars director JJ Abrams, Jay Z and President Obama. In addition to blockbuster ticket sales, the album of the show is the highest-selling cast recording for 50 years, picking up this year's Grammy Award for best musical theatre album. Erivo, who won best actress for her leading role in the Broadway revival of The Color Purple, said: \"I promised myself I wouldn't cry because my make-up artist would be really mad at me. Thank you American Theatre Wing for making a London girl very, very happy.\" The Color Purple began at the Menier Chocolate Factory in London in 2013, where Erivo played Celie. Its artistic director David Babani said: \"It's an honour to be recognised in this way by the theatre community in New York. \"However wonderful the events of tonight, they are overshadowed by the tragedy in Orlando, and our thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by this awful event.\" The other three best musical actor winners were from Hamilton. They were Leslie Odom Jr for lead actor, Daveed Diggs for featured actor and Renee Elise Goldsberry for featured actress. The show is expected to open at London's Victoria Palace Theatre in October 2017. Speaking before the ceremony, Hamilton's star and creator Lin-Manuel Miranda said the shooting was \"heavy in my heart and heavy in my mind\". Veteran US actor Frank Langella, who won best performance by a lead actor in a play for his role in The Father, urged Orlando to be \"strong\" in the wake of the atrocity. \"I'm standing in a room full of the most generous human beings on earth and we will be with you every step of the way,\" he said. Jessica Lange won the award for best performance by a lead actress in a play for her role as morphine-addicted Mary Tyrone in Long Day's Journey Into Night. \"This is a dream come true.

{"article": "The government plans to raise fees above \u00a39,000 for universities in England with \"high quality\" teaching. But Exeter has announced that the increase will also be applied to current as well as new students. The Liberal Democrats say they will table an amendment in Parliament to \"stop this outrageous practice\". Exeter students have used social media to express their irritation at the increase. Tim Quine, Exeter's deputy vice-chancellor, said: \"The decision to charge \u00a39,250 has not been taken lightly, but follows four years in which tuition fees have been frozen, while the costs of delivering a world leading education have continued to rise.\" But Labour's education spokesman Gordon Marsden said Exeter's raising fees, before the increase had been approved by Parliament, was a \"concerning and disturbing development\". Mr Marsden said students signed up for degree courses on the assumption that fees would not change - and that universities which introduced such increases would face \"criticism for changing the goalposts in an unethical manner\". John Pugh, Liberal Democrat education spokesman, said the increase for current students was \"completely unacceptable\". On the last day before the parliamentary summer break, the government published details of plans to allow universities to increase fees to \u00a39,250 from 2017-18, scrapping the maximum upper limit introduced during the controversial trebling of tuition fees in 2012. The plan would allow universities assessed as having \"high teaching standards\" to increase fees in line with inflation, calculated as 2.8% for next year. Universities had begun to advertise these higher fees for students about to apply this autumn, for next year's courses. But Exeter is also applying the increase to students already at the university. The measure is permitted under the government's proposals, but many other universities have so far not made a decision on whether to charge higher fees for students who entered when the legal maximum was set at \u00a39,000 per year. The University of Nottingham has promised current students, and those about to start this autumn, that there will be no increase above \u00a39,000 for the duration of their courses. Exeter's website says that the increase for new and current students is \"subject to approval from the government that we meet the criteria in the Teaching Excellence Framework\". The Teaching Excellence Framework is the system being created to measure the quality of teaching in universities. For the first year, no universities have failed to reach the necessary quality threshold. There was controversy over whether the university fee increase had been properly debated in Parliament. Opposition MPs were angry that the higher fees were being announced before the Higher Education Research Bill, currently before Parliament, had been approved. The government said the cap on fees could be lifted legitimately, via a statutory instrument, and that a vote would still be required if there was a challenge from MPs. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have warned the government that they intend to block the planned increases and there were warnings that ministers had tried to \"sneak out\" the fee changes. Universities had been accused by MPs of \"disgraceful arrogance\" in advertising higher fees before Parliament had approved them. Universities have argued that a fixed upper limit of \u00a39,000 has meant that the value of fees is being steadily eroded by inflation. They have also voiced concern about the legal requirement to provide consumer information about forthcoming higher fees, to students applying this autumn, though a legal maximum of \u00a39,000 remains in place until the proposed increase is approved.", "abstract": "Exeter University has told its current students that their tuition fees are going to be increased to \u00a39,250 from autumn 2017.", "candidate": "Students at the University of Exeter are to be charged \u00a39,250 per year for their degree courses.", "doc_id": 3261, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "Tim Quine, Exeter's deputy vice-chancellor, said: \"The decision to charge \u00a39,250 has not been taken lightly, but follows four years in which tuition fees have been frozen, while the costs of delivering a world leading education have continued to rise.\"", "explanation": "the dollar amount is correct, the university name is correct, and it is being charged for degree courses and for current students. all can be verified.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

It has already been on \"black alert\" - meaning there are not enough beds to cope with numbers coming in to A&E - twice this winter, in January and February. Dr Howes said the pressure was partly explained by the area's ageing population, many of whom have \"multiple conditions\".

George Ford kicked a late penalty to earn fifth-placed Bath a losing bonus point, but with two games left to play they are four points behind Leicester, who hammered Newcastle at Welford Road.

{"article": "Spray-painted yellow bikes stuck on walls compete with thousands of banners and flags. It is mass mobilisation with road closure signs in place for race days and temporary camp sites and car parks being prepared. Even one of my favourite pubs, The Waggon and Horses at Langsett in South Yorkshire, has temporarily changed its name to The Pedalers in honour of riders in Europe's biggest sporting event flashing by. The cafe across the road has come out in spots - its walls now painted like a giant King of the Mountains shirt. In all the razzmatazz one little sign might be missed as the peloton heads out of the West Yorkshire \"Last of the Summer Wine\" Pennine market town of Holmfirth and starts the long climb up the moorland road to the summit at Holme Moss on its way to Sheffield. It is a round granite millstone propped up at the side of the road. Pass it and you are in the boundaries of the Peak District National Park which spans the rugged spectacular moorlands bordering West and South Yorkshire. It is certainly no coincidence that the Tour organisers chose a county with three national parks to stage the opening two days of the 2014 competition - the \"Grand Depart\". By the time the riders have reached the top of Holme Moss they will already have gone right through one of the county's other National Parks, the Yorkshire Dales, and come within spitting distanced of the third - the North York Moors. These huge areas of natural beauty became parks over 60 years ago in order to give them legal protection from encroaching modernisation and urbanisation. The windfall in the 21st Century is they are now at the heart of a tourism industry that draws in 30 million visitors a year, film and TV production companies and now major money-spinning events like the Tour de France. But who oversees the running of the national parks and are they up to the job? Well there has just been a pretty broad hint that the government believes the growing economic role of the parks is far beyond the system devised in the 1950s where each park is run by an authority made up of appointed members with most seats on it reserved for local councillors. The messenger was Her Majesty the Queen. In her annual address on the opening of Parliament her speech contained just one line that could see the biggest change to governance in the six decades of the parks. She said her government would introduce legislation to enable ballot boxes to be used in the parks for the first time with the suggestion that members should be directly elected. It is likely to be fiercely debated with many of those on the authorities at the moment saying they are already elected as local councillors. Others point out that being elected for one body does not mean they can be held accountable for the decisions they make about another one.

{"article": "The weapons were intended for Syrian Kurdish fighters. Small arms, ammunition and other weaponry were dropped in 28 bundles on Monday by the US to help those defending the town of Kobane from IS. A US spokesman said 26 of the dropped equipment ended up in the right hands. The Pentagon says one bundle of weapons was taken by IS fighters while a second stray bundle was destroyed in an air strike. So how did it happen? And could the same mistake be made again? Dr David Betz from the Department of War Studies at King's College London is an expert in strategy, insurgency and counter-insurgency. Newsbeat put these questions to him. Air dropping supplies to forces on the ground is never a first choice. It's costly relative to other means, and though it is a well-established and a long-practised technique, it is also relatively inaccurate, for obvious reasons. It's done when there is no other alternative, most often as in this case, because the supported force is effectively beleaguered. It would seem that Turkey is not permitting supplies to the Kurds fighting in Syria to cross its border. If it were it would be much simpler, more efficient, and effective to do it that way. Often. That is why it's a last resort. Military history is full of instances of surrounded forces being supplied from the air. Think of the Germans at Stalingrad surrounded by the Russians in the winter of 1942-43, the British paras at Arnhem in the Netherlands surrounded by German forces in 1944, American marines at Khe Sanh surrounded by North Vietnamese forces in 1968. Or in a slightly different way the Allied supply of the French Resistance throughout the war. Sometimes it works - often it doesn't. As noted above, it is a well established skill and no doubt armed forces have gotten a lot more accurate over time but there are inherent limitations of accuracy when dropping things on pallets dangling from parachutes into an active combat zone where forces are intermixed in close proximity. Undoubtedly they are deriving propagandic value from it, as the article suggests, but that is not to say they are making it up. I would say all of the above, of course. Weather, enemy action, pilot or navigational error, equipment failure... War is inherently chancy and it makes the simplest things difficult. I wouldn't necessarily characterise the drop as not going as planned. The planners would have known quite well that there was a strong possibility of some items going astray. In fact, they'd know to a good deal of precision what the per cent would be. It goes back to the previous point of having no better option. If the only way of getting however many tonnes of military supplies to the Kurdish forces was to drop them in a way that IS got its hands on a fraction of them it might still be judged worthwhile to do so.

What you may not realise is that from low-cost Vietnam to high-rolling Venezuela, the bill can vary hugely. They are the cheapest and dearest nations in e-commerce platform Linio.com's Beauty Price Index. To compile its list, Linio surveyed the cost of cosmetic products and services in 50 countries to find the price of beauty around the world. It looked at three different categories: beauty services, such as hairdos; cosmetic procedures, including Botox and breast jobs; and products, such as make-up and perfume. It found that on the whole, developing nations offer the most affordable beauty services, but show mark-ups on popular cosmetic products. However, Venezuela bucks the emerging market trend. Despite being renowned for its beauty queens, the South American nation is in the throes of economic collapse after years of fiscal mismanagement, and this has caused the cost of looking good to spiral out of control. Apart from that anomaly, the price gap is much as you would expect. The countries where the cost of beauty is higher tend to be in regions that have a higher cost of living in general, such as northern Europe and North America. After Venezuela, the most expensive countries for cosmetic products and services are Switzerland, Norway, Denmark and Finland, with Australia, Sweden and the US close behind. The cheapest places after Vietnam are India, South Africa, Thailand and Egypt. The Czech Republic, Colombia and Panama also score well. The UK comes in on the pricey side, ranking 36th cheapest out of the 50 nations surveyed. \"We hope that our index helps people more confidently interpret variations in costs associated with beauty around the world,\" said Linio's chief executive, Andreas Mjelde. \"Increasingly, the average citizen is a global one, and with a better understanding of global markets comes empowerment to travel, shop and live smarter.\"", "abstract": "Country star Dolly Parton once said of her appearance that \"it costs a lot of money to look this cheap\".", "candidate": "If you've ever been to a beauty salon, you'll have seen people paying thousands of dollars to look their best.", "doc_id": 1612, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Linio surveyed 50 countries to find the price of beauty around the world and found things generally cost more in countries with a higher cost of living.", "evidence": "The countries where the cost of beauty is higher tend to be in regions that have a higher cost of living in general, such as northern Europe and North America.", "explanation": "the original summary is not correct because it is a generic statement that doesn't really capture what the source text describes.", "instruction": "Rewrite the summary by using the info in the source text to come up with a summary that accurately reflects what it says.", "instruction_list": ["Rewrite the summary by using the info in the source text to come up with a summary that accurately reflects what it says."]}}

Officials says more than 1.4 million people urgently need humanitarian help. There are also fears of a cholera outbreak, with spikes in cases and deaths reported in the south west. The waterborne disease reached the island via Nepalese UN troops after the deadly earthquake in 2010, causing the deaths of nearly 10,000 people.

Polanski has been wanted by US police since 1977, when he fled the country fearing a lengthy jail sentence after being charged with having sex with a 13-year-old girl. The Rosemary's Baby director was held in Switzerland in 2009 after travelling to Zurich to pick up a prize at another film festival, but the extradition bid failed and he was eventually allowed to return to his home in France. 1977: Polanski is charged in the US with the rape of a 13-year-old girl.

A citizen of France, he is protected by the country's limited extradition with the US. 2009: The US rejects Polanski's request for the case against him to be dismissed. On a visit to Switzerland later that year, he is at first imprisoned and then placed under house arrest, as the authorities consider a US extradition request. 2010: Swiss authorities decide against extraditing Polanski, freeing him from house arrest. 2014: Polanski is questioned by prosecutors in Poland, acting on a US request.

{"article": "A first-half David McAllister own goal was all that separated the sides in a tight affair at Mourneview Park. Coleraine hammered Glentoran 4-1 at the Showgrounds with James McLaughlin scoring twice. David Jeffrey's Ballymena United ran out easy 4-1 winners away to Carrick Rangers to move into the top half of the table. Relive the action from Friday's Premiership matches . Despite suffering their first defeat of the season, Ards are still tied on points at the top of the table. There were few clear chances in the game, with defences on top before McAllister nodded past keeper Aaron Hogg and into his own net after 17 minutes of play. Crusaders and Linfield can overtake the joint leaders if they win their respective games on Saturday. The Bannsiders put four goals past Glentoran, who continued their disappointing start to the league campaign. Coleraine took the lead after eight minutes when referee Mervyn Smith pointed to the penalty spot when Elliott Morris was adjudged to have brought down James McLaughlin despite getting a strong palm on the ball. Neil McCafferty made no mistake from the spot by slotting past Morris, although the Glentoran keeper may feel aggrieved that he wasn't ready to face the kick. Three goals in nine minutes assured Coleraine of the points. Darren McCauley tucked home after being played through by Rodney Brown, before McLaughlin drove the ball home from the edge of the penalty area three minutes later. McLaughlin grabbed his second just after the hour mark to wrap up the victory, before Jonathan Smith fired home after some good work from Nacho Novo to give Glentoran a consolation goal. Defeat for Glentoran means that the East Belfast side slip into the bottom half of the table, while Coleraine's first victory of the season carries Oran Kearney's side up to eighth. Ballymena responded from last weekend's defeat by Ards in perfect style, putting four goals past Carrick Rangers. Allan Jenkins opened the scoring, slamming home from a corner after just three minutes. Cathair Friel doubled Ballymena's advantage on 22 minutes by heading in from a Tony Kane free-kick. Carrick Rangers were provided with a glimmer of hope when Alan Blayney picked up a back-pass and Gareth McKeown's free-kick rebounded off the United wall for Nathan Hanley to make no mistake from the rebound.

{"article": "Some see in this the potential for a new era in Russian-French relations. Maybe not the strategic alliance of old, but certainly an end to the modern-day chill. Events have certainly moved quickly. A year ago France was in the middle of a nasty spat over warships which it was refusing to sell to Vladimir Putin. For France, the Russian leader was a destabilising presence on Europe's eastern borders. EU sanctions - intended to contain Russian ambitions in Crimea and Ukraine - had full French backing. Today there are more pressing concerns. In the wake of the Paris attacks, President Hollande had a vision of a single, united international coalition - the nations of the world working together to eradicate IS. Realities have since deflated that ambition. The Americans and the Russians are not going to work together any time soon. And the Turko-Russian crisis over the downed Sukhoi Russian warplane is a further complication. But still, the French want as many countries on side as possible. And the Russians - by dint of their military presence in Syria - are a major player. As one diplomatic official told Le Monde: \"Right now we are probably more prepared to work with the Russians than Barack Obama is.\" President Hollande has two goals in his talks with Vladimir Putin. First he wants to persuade Russia to direct its airstrikes away from the \"moderate\" Syrian opposition and onto targets belonging to IS. Second, he wants a firmer understanding that Russia will not stick indefinitely behind Bashar al-Assad. The French feel they have made a significant change in policy by de-prioritising the removal of the Syrian leader. It took a good deal of pride-swallowing to make the concession, because until two weeks ago Paris was President Assad's greatest scourge. But there is only so far that the French will go down this line. And they feel Russia should also give some slack. There are a number of factors in favour of a rapprochement. First of all, Russia has itself now come face-to-face with IS terrorism - with the destruction of the tourist plane from Sharm el-Sheikh. This has jolted perceptions in Moscow, for which IS is now a designated enemy. Second, Russia has every interest in cultivating Paris as a new friend. Straight after the Paris attacks, Mr Putin ordered his military to co-ordinate with the French in the campaign against IS - an unprecedented act given that France is in Nato. The Russian leader was effusive with compassion, and even sent a dog - Dobrynya - to replace Diesel the French special forces Alsatian who was killed in the raid in Saint Denis. It was all very deliberate, because there is nothing the Russians would like more than to lure the French out of the American-Western orbit. In the geopolitics departments of Russian universities - and some French ones too - this is regarded as a historically-determined necessity. France and Russia, after all, are two great nations lying at either end of the European continent - with a shared interest in preventing its domination either by outsiders (the US) or insiders (Germany). Throughout the last three centuries the two countries have been periodic allies - notably in the run-up to World War One. But also President Charles de Gaulle himself - though viscerally anti-Communist - kept his distance from the Americans by flirting with the Soviet Union. What could be more natural - say Kremlin insiders - than for France to resume its natural role, triangulating between Washington and Moscow? But tempting as this might sound to some in France, there is no geostrategic shift in the offing. For one thing the French do not trust Vladimir Putin. For another, the two countries still have opposing visions on too many key issues. France will never abandon Ukraine. And in the Middle East, France's allies are the Gulf states and Saudi Arabia - not the Shia axis backed by Russia. There is a concordance of interests bringing Paris and Moscow together. With luck, this will help in the battle against IS.

{"article": "Vicki Russell told the CBC that Air Canada bumped her from the 1 April Toronto-to-Miami flight that she had booked two months in advance. As a result she missed her connecting flight to meet the cruise ship. Ms Russell has since received C$800 (US$592; \u00c2\u00a3463) compensation from the airline. She says everything went according to plan until an agent told her about two hours after she had checked in and received her boarding pass that the flight was overbooked and she did not have a valid ticket. Despite showing her travel documents and getting the tour company to email her trip receipt to prove her ticket was valid, the flight left without her. \"It was extremely upsetting,\" Ms Russell told the CBC. \"The woman could not have been more rude, hostile. In all my years of travelling, I have never had a travel person treat me so badly.\" She was sent to Air Canada customer service at the airport to find a new flight to Miami. By the time she was seen by an agent, no flights were available that would allow her to make the connection. She also had to wait to get back her checked luggage. She filed a complaint for missing her \"dream vacation\" with Air Canada the next day. The $10,000 National Geographic cruise, organised by Lindblad Expeditions, tours the famous Pacific Ocean archipelago's varied islands and habitats. A spokeswoman for Lindblad Expeditions said on Friday they have been in contact with Ms Russell throughout the situation and have rebooked her expedition at no charge, including airfare from Miami to Galapagos. Air Canada confirmed that the flight had been oversold. But the carrier said their agents spent \"a great deal of time\" looking at options for Ms Russell, including exploring \"outside the box\" solutions for getting her directly to the Galapagos Islands despite her flight ticket being issued only to Miami. They noted they refunded her initial fare and paid compensation. \"This is a very regrettable situation and we are sorry this occurred,\" said an Air Canada spokesman in a statement. The practice of airlines bumping passengers from flights has been under scrutiny since the footage of United Airlines passenger David Dao being forcibly removed from a flight made headlines worldwide. Following that incident, Canada's federal government reiterated its pledge to table a passenger rights law this spring. It is expected to include compensation rules for those denied boarding due to factors within the carrier's control. The Canadian Transportation Agency receives an average of about 50 complaints a year from passengers saying they were denied boarding.", "abstract": "A Canadian woman missed a \"trip of a lifetime\" Galapagos cruise after being bumped from a flight.", "candidate": "A Canadian woman says she missed her \"dream vacation\" after being bumped from a flight to the Galapagos Islands.", "doc_id": 1939, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "A  woman says she missed her \"dream vacation\" after being bumped from a flight to Miami.", "evidence": "Vicki Russell told the CBC that Air Canada bumped her from the 1 April Toronto-to-Miami flight that she had booked two months in advance.", "explanation": "The person is not confirmed to be Canadian and this specific flight was only going to Miami .", "instruction": "Remove the information about Canadian from the summary.

{"article": "Allan Bell made the statement during peaceful demonstrations by pro-choice and anti-abortion campaigners outside the Manx parliament on Tuesday. Mr Bell said work on changing the legislation would begin \"at the end of this year, early next year\". The Termination of Pregnancy Act 1995 is the current law governing abortions in the Isle of Man. This means a termination can only be carried out on the island in the case of a pregnancy arising from a criminal offence such as rape, or on mental health grounds. For most women seeking an abortion, the only option is to travel to the UK to pay for the procedure. Manx campaign group, CALM (Campaign for Abortion Law Modernisation), which was established in April, wants island legislation to be brought in line with the UK. Although it is not currently illegal, the group said it is \"almost impossible\" for women to have a termination on the Isle of Man. A spokesman added: \"The current act is incredibly restrictive. We are not saying abortion should be available to everyone at the drop of a hat.\" Anti-abortion campaigners at the rally held banners saying: \"Thou shalt not kill\". A spokesman said: \"I'm part of a group which is here to represent the rights of unborn babies.\" Chief Minister Allan Bell said the legislation was due to be reviewed after the Isle of Man's general election in September.", "abstract": "The chief minister of the Isle of Man has said abortion laws on the island \"need changing\".", "candidate": "The Isle of Man's chief minister has announced plans to review the island's abortion laws.", "doc_id": 367, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "Chief Minister Allan Bell said the legislation was due to be reviewed after the Isle of Man's general election in September.", "explanation": "The summary contains correct details from the source text: The position of the man ( The Isle of Man's chief minister) and his plans to review the island's abortion laws (\"Mr Bell said work on changing the legislation \" ... \"Bell said the legislation was due to be reviewed \")", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}
