{"article": "The Markit/CIPS manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 49.2 from 50.7 in March. A reading below 50 indicates falling output. It is the first time that activity in the sector has fallen since March 2013. Firms blamed soft domestic demand, a fall in new business from overseas and uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum. A slowdown in the oil and gas industry, a major customer for UK companies, is also hitting production. The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said: \"On this evidence manufacturing production is now falling at a quarterly pace of around 1%, and will likely act as a drag on the economy again during the second quarter and putting greater pressure on the service sector to sustain GDP growth. \"The manufacturing labour market is also being impacted, with the data signalling close to 20,000 job losses over the past three months.\" Last week, official figures showed UK economic growth slowed to 0.4% in the first quarter of the year from 0.6% in late 2015, propped up by the services sector. David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS), said: \"Recent fears over a stall in the UK's manufacturing sector have now become a reality. \"An atmosphere of deep unease is building throughout the manufacturing supply chain, eating away at new orders, reducing British exports and putting more jobs at risk. \"A sense of apprehension across the sector is being caused by enduring volatility in the oil and gas industry, falling retailer confidence and the uncertainty created by the EU referendum.\" The Markit/CIPS survey found new export orders contracted for the fourth straight month in April as the global economy continued to slow. A measure of employment in the manufacturing sector was also below the 50 mark for its fourth straight month. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation, EEF, said: \"The sharp drop to a three-year low and another month of reported job cuts could be the clearest sign yet that referendum uncertainty is starting to weigh on the real economy. \"However, this is just another straw on the back of a sector already grappling with the struggling oil and gas sector, softening domestic demand and weak order outlook from other parts of the world, all of which are failing to provide any counterbalance to the political uncertainty at home.\"", "abstract": "UK manufacturing activity contracted in April for the first time in three years, a survey has indicated, adding to fears over the economy's strength.", "candidate": "Activity in the UK's manufacturing sector fell to a three-year low in April, according to a closely watched survey.", "doc_id": 103, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "The index for new orders fell to 50.4 in April, from 51.9 the month before, matching February's three-year low.", "explanation": "The summary correctly states the sector hit a three year low and it was said by a survey.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

{"article": "Martin McCauley was seriously wounded and a teenager was killed when police opened fire on a hayshed in County Armagh in 1982. It later emerged that the security services had secretly recorded what happened. The evidence was not made available to the court during his trial. The 52-year-old, from Lurgan, County Armagh, was arrested along with Niall Connolly and James Monaghan in Colombia in 2001 and accused of IRA training of rebel FARC guerrilla forces. They were initially cleared of the charge, only to be convicted on appeal and sentenced to 17 years in jail. But the three men avoided imprisonment by fleeing Colombia in 2004, turning up in the Republic of Ireland a year later. Even though Mr McCauley faces extradition to South America if he returns to Northern Ireland, the Court of Appeal in Belfast is examining a weapons conviction for which he received a two-year suspended jail sentence. Police claimed Martin McCauley confronted them with a rifle at a hayshed 32 years ago during the so-called RUC shoot to kill incident. He was seriously injured and Michael Tighe was killed when RUC officers opened fire. In 1985, Martin McCauley was convicted of possession of three rifles found inside the shed and given a two-year suspended sentence. He had insisted he and Michael Tighe, had not been armed and that the police opened fire without warning. The police told the court that was not true. Years after his conviction, it was revealed that MI5 had a listening device hidden inside the hayshed at the time of the shooting that recorded what happened. That recording could have re-established whether the police issued any warnings or made any reference to Mr McCauley being armed before they opened fire. The existence of the recording was not made known to the court at the time of his trial. Its existence was discovered by the former Deputy Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, Sir John Stalker, as part of his investigation into allegations that the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) was operating a shoot to kill policy. He also discovered that the recording was later destroyed. Last year, the Criminal Cases Review Commission referred his case to the Court of Appeal, on the basis that potentially significant material had been withheld from the judge. In a dramatic development on Wednesday, Gerald Simpson QC told the court he had been instructed to read a statement on behalf of the prosecution service. It said material relevant to the decision to prosecute Mr McCauley was withheld from the director of public prosecutions at the time, from the court and from the defence in the trial. The statement said this served only to undermine public confidence in the criminal justice system and to bring it into disrepute. The lawyer told the three Appeal Court judges that the prosecution service would not be making any submissions to uphold the conviction and invited them to exercise their discretion to quash it. The judges will sit next week to decide whether to do so. Mr McCauley's lawyers will argue that the conviction should be quashed on the basis that vital evidence was not available to the trial judge. The contents of John Stalker's investigation into the incident have never been made public. The lawyers hope that will change during next week's hearing. \"Mr McCauley was tried in public, and he was convicted in public and it's his fundamental right that these documents be opened in the public court, so that he and the general public are aware of what actually occurred,\" Mr McCauley's lawyer, Fearghal Shiels, said.

{"article": "The revolutionary technology will allow wind power to be harvested in waters too deep for the current conventional bottom-standing turbines used. The Peterhead wind farm, known as Hywind, is a trial which will bring power to 20,000 homes. Manufacturer Statoil says output from the turbines is expected to equal or surpass generation from current ones. It hopes to cash in on a boom in the technology, especially in Japan and the West coast of the US, where waters are deep. \"This is a tech development project to ensure it's working in open sea conditions. It's a game-changer for floating wind power and we are sure it will help bring costs down,\" said Leif Delp, project director for Hywind. So far, one giant turbine has already been moved into place, while four more wait in readiness in a Norwegian fjord. By the end of the month they'll all have been towed to 15 miles off Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, where they'll float upright like giant fishing floats. While the turbines are currently very expensive to make, Statoil believes that in the future it will be able to dramatically reduce costs in the same way that manufacturers already have for conventional offshore turbines. \"I think eventually we will see floating wind farms compete without subsidy - but to do that we need to get building at scale,\" said Mr Delp. The operation to begin shifting the first of the 11,500 tonne giants happened dramatically in the half-light of a Norwegian summer night. Crews secured thick cables to tug boats and used remote-controlled submarines to check for obstacles. Finally the giant was on the move, floating on a sealed vase-like tube 78 metres deep, its bottom filled with iron ore to weight the base and keep it upright in the water. The price of energy from bottom-standing offshore wind farms has plummeted 32% since 2012 - far faster that anyone predicted. The price is now four years ahead of the government's expected target, and another big price drop is expected, taking offshore wind to a much lower price than new nuclear power. The Hywind project is being run in collaboration with the Abu Dhabi firm Masdar. The \u00c2\u00a3190m cost was subsidised by bill-payers under the UK government's Renewable Obligation Certificates. The bird charity RSPB Scotland opposed the project - not because it dislikes the technology but because it believes too many offshore turbines in the area have already been approved. It fears thousands of sea birds may be killed by the offshore wind farms, although it admits that estimates are hugely uncertain because it is impossible to count bird corpses at sea. The RSPB's Aidan Smith told BBC News: \"Generally we are very enthusiastic about floating wind technology because it allows turbines to be placed far offshore - away from seabird nesting sites, and it helps us tackle climate change. \"We oppose the Hywind project because it adds to a situation we already believe is a problem.\" Floating turbines may create a new frontier for energy - but scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warn far more investment in additional new technologies is urgently needed for governments to keep promises on reducing emissions.

But his artistic legacy could have looked very different had Monet's rural neighbours had their way. Local farmers wrote to the town hall to object to his plans to extend his garden in 1893. The original documents about the case were unearthed by Ann Dumas, co-curator of the Royal Academy's Painting the Modern Garden: Monet to Matisse exhibition. \"There was a protest from local farmers who were very suspicious of these strange aquatic plants that Monet wanted to plant because they they would poison their water and kill their cattle,\" she said. Monet, who moved to Giverny in 1883, had been able to buy land on the other side of a railway line that bordered his house. It was here he wanted to create his water garden by diverting the river Epte, a tributary of the Seine.

{"article": "Solly Msimanga, from the opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), said the vehicles would instead be given to a police anti-hijack unit. However, he will continue to use the luxury car used by the previous mayor. The DA took control of Tshwane, a metropolitan area including the capital Pretoria, from the African National Congress (ANC) in local elections. Mr Msimanga said no more luxury cars would be bought under his leadership. He took over from the governing ANC, which lost control of the capital for the first time since 1994, last month. More on this and other African stories . Four things from South Africa election .

He will still use a BMW 5 series car he inherited from the previous mayor, reports the IOL website. Mr Msimanga's spokesman Matthew Gerstner told the BBC that this vehicle could not \"be dispensed with because it's been bought and paid for already and treasury regulations prohibit that\". He added: \"But, as soon as he can replace it, he will, with a sensible, low-cost vehicle\". Mr Msimango says the DA-led coalition government wanted to embark on cost-cutting measures.

{"article": "He faces a number of charges. First, he pulled out of a long-planned trip to Moscow after the US missile strike on a Syrian airfield. It was agreed the US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson should go instead. Poodle, cried his critics. Next, Team Boris briefed journalists that the foreign secretary wanted to get the G7 to agree new sanctions against Russia at its meeting in the Italian city of Lucca. But Mr Johnson entirely failed to persuade other countries to agree. Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano said there was no consensus new sanctions would help and argued they could push Russia into a corner. Mr Johnson's own view of the Syrian conflict seems to have swerved around like a shopping trolley since he became the UK's chief diplomat in July. Giving evidence to a House of Lords committee at the start of 2017, he signalled a shift in UK policy towards Syria. Mr Johnson said the \"mantra\" of calling for President Assad to go had not worked and the military space had been left open to Russia to fill. The Foreign Secretary told peers President Assad should be allowed to run for election as part of a \"democratic resolution\" of the civil war. Now, however, Mr Johnson believes the Syrian leader has to go. How much of this is fair? And what might the episode say about Boris Johnson's standing in Theresa May's government? First, the UK was a bystander to the Trump administration's missile strike on Syria. The government was given a courtesy call to say it was coming but the UK was not asked to be involved. Mr Johnson's trip to Moscow (which would have been the first by a British foreign secretary to Russia for five years) was long planned and quickly binned. I understand Mrs May told Mr Johnson it was his call whether he wanted to go or not. After speaking to Rex Tillerson, Mr Johnson and his US opposite number agreed it was best for one man to deliver a single message to Moscow. Mr Johnson then spent a weekend hitting the phones to other G7 countries trying to get a united position agreed ahead of the meeting in Lucca. In its final communique, the G7 did agree to state the Assad regime had to end. But further sanctions - an idea endorsed by Number 10 - got nowhere. It was clearly a snub to Mr Johnson although government sources insist sanctions have not been taken off the table. On Wednesday, the Chancellor, Phillip Hammond, said other countries were \"less forward-leaning\" than the UK on the issue. Diplomacy is tough. But it may have been unwise for the Foreign Office to suggest sanctions were an ambition when key G7 nations clearly didn't agree. At the weekend, I was told by Team Boris that he was very relaxed about the sniping and criticism being lobbed his way in recent days. And Mr Johnson has provoked quite a lot since he became foreign secretary, largely because of his use of decidedly undiplomatic language. He was taken to task by a Swedish MEP in February for calling Brexit a \"liberation\". A month before that, Mr Johnson warned the French president not to respond to Brexit by administering \"punishment beatings\" in the manner of a World War Two film. Guy Verhofstadt, who speaks for the European Parliament on Brexit, branded the remarks \"abhorrent and deeply unhelpful\". It was several days after President Trump's election that Boris Johnson said it was time for Mr Trump's critics to get over their \"whinge-o-rama\" - a comment I know left some officials in Brussels agog. Mr Johnson is always keen to speak with the swashbuckling pluck of the newspaper columnist he once was. His many fans in the Tory party might love it. But even Mrs May has hinted at exasperation. At the Conservative Party conference last autumn, the prime minister said: \"Do we have a plan for Brexit? We do. Are we ready for the effort it will take to see it through? We are. Can Boris Johnson stay on message for a full four days? Just about.\" It was a joke. But not many prime ministers joke about their foreign secretary's erraticism. Then in December, Mrs May described Boris Johnson as an FFS - saying that in this case it stood for being a Fine Foreign Secretary (and not the punchy abbreviation for a term of exasperation). When Mrs May was home secretary and Mr Johnson was London mayor they had a prickly relationship. She then beat him to the job he craved. Her appointment of the Brexit campaign's most prominent champion to the job of foreign secretary stunned Westminster and it remains one of the most intriguing political relationships within the government. While happy to clip his wings publicly from time to time, Theresa May also needs Boris Johnson on board as she embarks on Brexit.

The row dates from 2003 when the Winklevosses hired Mr Zuckerberg to write code for their ConnectU site while at Harvard.

In January 2011 the Winklevosses tried to reopen the case, seeking more money. However, a US appeals court ruled in April that they would have to accept the settlement.

{"article": "A total of three devices from the two companies contain cells with 4,000 milliamp-hour (mAh) capacities. That is more than a third higher than the components used in Samsung and Apple's latest flagship phones. Customer surveys have repeatedly highlighted a desire for improved battery life at the top of shopper's most wished for smartphone features. But until now, batteries of this size have been more commonly found in tablets rather than 5.5in (14cm)-screened phones. \"People are constantly engaged with their screens and the screen uses the most power,\" explained Ben Wood from the tech consultancy CCS Insight. \"And the biggest challenge right now is that people are also consuming more video content, thanks to the spread of 4G networks, meaning phone battery life is really getting hammered. \"With the bigger brands people are willing to accept some trade-offs for the phones to appear as slim and slick as possible. \"But everyone else is looking for a way of trying to differentiate their devices. And Lenovo and Acer, in particular, have an eye on the business market where employers want their workers to be available for as many hours as possible.\" China-based Lenovo says its new K80 offers up to 33 hours of talk-time and its A5000 up to 35 hours. Both figures are based on the use of a 2G network, which is less energy-intensive than a 3G or 4G connection. Taiwan's Acer has yet to provide a comparable figure for its Liquid X2, which is also unusual for supporting up to three Sim cards at once. \"Following market feedback, we know that battery life is a priority for our customers,\" ST Liew, president of Acer's smartphone business division, told the BBC. \"The 4,000mAh battery is perfect for frequent travellers as it eliminates concerns regarding power, allowing users to be constantly connected whilst on-the-go without the need to carry a charger on a daily basis.\" The firms are not the first to use bigger lithium-ion batteries to make their phones stand out. Last year Motorola developed the Moto Maxx, ahead of its takeover by Lenovo. The handset features a 3,900 mAh battery, which the company said should allow it to survive two days between charges. And earlier this month Huawei announced the P8 Max with a 4,360mAh battery - although the size of the device's 6.8in (17.3cm) display means that many people would consider it more a call-enabled tablet than a phone. Some lesser-known handset-makers have opted to fit even bigger, bulkier parts. Philips's Android-powered Xenium W6610, released last year, has a 5,300mAh cell, allowing it to endure up to three days of heavy use. And the recently-released Elephone P5000 currently claims the lead with a 5350mAh battery, which the Chinese company says is large enough to let it stretch to four days of \"continuous use\". At a time when it has become the norm for manufacturers to build smartphones with non-removable batteries, it might be expected that those with bigger capacities would enjoy stronger sales. But one analyst said that despite what shoppers tell surveys, when it comes to buying a personal handset they tend to prioritise other issues such as photo quality, brand or cost. \"If a handset fails to last a minimum of a day then it won't sell, but once you get past that it doesn't really drive demand,\" said Tim Coulling from the market research firm Canalys. \"Most people have at least one opportunity to charge their phone within that time period and there is also a market in battery packs for power-users. \"The other thing is that the more battery life you have the more you end up using your phone anyway.

{"article": "Bemba, 53, was accused of failing to stop his rebels from killing and raping people in neighbouring Central African Republic (CAR) in 2002 and 2003. He had sent more than 1,000 fighters to help put down an attempted coup. Bemba, once vice-president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, will remain in custody until sentencing. The court in The Hague found him guilty of several charges including rape and murder. He is expected to appeal. It is the first time the ICC has focused on rape as a weapon of war, and the first time a suspect has been convicted over crimes committed by others under his command. The fact that Bemba was convicted for sexual violence is significant. Many Congolese suspects have been accused of such crimes, but this is the first guilty verdict. His conviction was for crimes committed in the Central African Republic, but it will send the message to high-ranking soldiers and militiamen in DR Congo, where sexual violence is rife, that they are responsible for preventing it. But in Congo, despite his murky record, Jean-Pierre Bemba still enjoys significant popularity. Members of his opposition party had hoped he would be released in time to run in the next presidential election, which is scheduled for the end of this year. Welcoming the verdict, ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said: \"While the reality of the crimes is appalling, the significance of this decision is to be celebrated. \"What this decision affirms is that commanders are responsible for the acts of the forces under their control.\" Carrie Comer, from the International Federation for Human Rights, said the verdict was \"a historic moment for victims of such unspeakable atrocities\". It was \"a strong message from ICC judges that commanders must prevent and punish war crimes,\" she wrote on Twitter. It is alleged that for a period of five months Bemba's Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC) rebel fighters killed hundred of civilians, raped women and looted. The court heard horrific accounts, including how a man, his wife, his daughters and his granddaughter were all gang-raped by militiamen. Who is Jean-Pierre Bemba? Profile: Jean-Pierre Bemba . More about DR Congo . Bemba's lawyers argued that once the troops had crossed the border they were no longer under his command, but under the then-CAR President Ange-Felix Patasse. But the presiding judge ruled that Bemba had effective control over the troops and was therefore \"criminally responsible\". Mr Bemba led the MLC during DR Congo's brutal civil war. He is the son of a prominent businessman and a former assistant to ex-Congolese President Mobutu Sese Seko. After a peace deal in DR Congo in 2003, he laid down his arms and joined an interim government. Bemba is the most senior figure to face judgement at the court and only the third person to be convicted since the court's founding in 2002. Germain Katanga and Thomas Lubanga, both Congolese former warlords, have previously been found guilty of offences. What does this verdict mean for the ICC? This is a rare success for a beleaguered institution. It is the court's first conviction for rape as a war crime and establishes the principle that commanders are responsible for the actions of their subordinates. Why have there been so few convictions? The cases are often complex and so it takes a long time to go through the evidence. There are also logistical problems such as bringing witnesses from remote areas and organising translators. However, some cases have collapsed, most notably that of Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta. Why are most of its cases in Africa? This is a question African leaders have often asked - they say the many African cases are evidence of discrimination.

{"article": "The stand-in captain faced 535 balls across two innings, moving from 174 not out overnight to end 219 not out in Surrey's first-innings score of 483. Following on, he then made 68 in Surrey's 166-3 to keep Hampshire at bay and prompt handshakes at 16:50 BST. The draw sees third-placed Hampshire claim 12 points, while Surrey take 10 points and stay sixth in Division One. Burns' epic effort saw him stay in the field for all but 10 overs of the entire match, as he defied Hampshire's bowling efforts on a flat Oval pitch. The left-hander was dropped twice in the slip cordon in his career-best 219, but was the only one to resist as Ian Holland (3-37) dismissed Tom Curran (53), Amar Virdi and Mark Footitt to force the follow-on after Surrey began the day on 410-7. Mark Stoneman (47) and Burns then put on an opening stand of 109 before Holland's medium pace had Stoneman lbw and Scott Borthwick bowled in a single over. Sean Ervine became the only man to dismiss Burns in 756 minutes of play when he missed a ball down the leg side, but Jason Roy and Dominic Sibley continued on until the conclusion. Surrey captain Rory Burns told BBC Radio London: \"I'm really pleased that we've fought that hard to get the draw and the extra five points, and obviously pretty happy with how I've played. \"We had to bat seven sessions to get us to safety and that's all I was thinking. \"There were some jitters in the nineties and I got a lifeline, which was quite nice.

{"article": "The meeting, at Mr Putin's summer residence in Sochi, comes at a low point in bilateral relations over the war in Syria and Russia's annexation of Crimea. They are expected to discuss both issues during their meeting - but no breakthroughs are expected. Mr Putin will then meet Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Wednesday. Ties between Russia and Germany have worsened since Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea in Ukraine, with Germany being a driving force behind the EU sanctions imposed in response. The pair, who are among the most powerful world leaders, have crossed paths at international summits recently. But this meeting - with the official purpose of discussing the G20 summit of world leaders to be held in Hamburg in July - is the first trip Mrs Merkel has made to Russia in two years. Mrs Merkel wants Russia to seek an end to the conflict in Ukraine by using its influence on pro-Russian separatists, and also needs Moscow's co-operation to bring peace to Syria, the BBC correspondent in Berlin, Damien McGuinness, says. But President Putin equally needs Mrs Merkel's support in to lift the EU's sanctions, our correspondent adds. Mr Putin is also keen to hear her opinion of US President Donald Trump, whom she recently met. The pair spoke frequently before the breakdown in communications since 2014, and were said to have a grudging respect for one another. She speaks Russian, having grown up in communist East Germany, and he speaks German, from his years working for the KGB in Dresden in the 1980s. Russian news outlet Tass said the pair would discuss terrorism, the Middle East, and the Minsk agreements on the Ukraine crisis, quoting a Kremlin press source. But both sides have downplayed the prospect of major breakthroughs during their meeting in Sochi. Germany remains critical of Russia's actions in Crimea in 2014, and the two leaders stand opposed on the war in Syria. The German domestic intelligence agency has also accused Russia of being behind a series of cyber attacks on state computer systems. In contrast, Mr Putin's scheduled meeting with the Turkish president the following day comes at a time of increased co-operation between the two nations. While they back opposing sides in Syria's civil war - with Moscow supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and Ankara his opponents - the two countries began carrying out joint air strikes against the so-called Islamic State in January. The joint operation came a little over a year after Turkey shot down a Russian military jet, resulting in a crisis in bilateral relations. US President Donald Trump is also scheduled to speak to President Putin by phone on Tuesday, the White House announced Monday night.

The project has been organised by the Woodland Trust, and is one of four new woods being created across the UK.

The four-year project is one of the trust's most ambitious planting programmes and uses the pledge: \"We will stand for those who fell.\" In Brackfield Wood, the conservation charity plans to plant 40,000 trees in tribute to the estimated 40,000 people from the island of Ireland who lost their lives in the conflict. The trust said it was inviting local people and visitors to the Faughan Valley to \"get involved and to make a mark on history through the simple act of tree planting\". Its director, Patrick Cregg, said: \"This is a special opportunity to make a personal and hands-on contribution to Brackfield Wood, still very much in its infancy.

{"article": "European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the UK may want to be more \"obliging\" to certain countries to secure future commercial advantages. The EU is keen to maintain a united front and conduct central negotiations. Meanwhile, a leading candidate to be France's next President says he will take a \"pretty tough\" line on Brexit. Emmanuel Macron, who opinion polls suggest could win May's election, told Channel 4 News the UK should not be punished for voting to leave the EU but the EU's interests had to be paramount into the upcoming negotiations. \"We have to preserve the rest of the European Union and not to convey the message that you can decide to leave without any consequence,\" he said. Official discussions on the terms of the UK's exit and its future relationship with the EU are expected to begin in the Spring once the UK has triggered Article 50 - notifying the union of its intention to leave. Prime Minister Theresa May has made clear that the UK will leave the EU's single market and wants bespoke commercial and customs agreements based on tariff-free and \"frictionless\" cross-border trade. She has also made clear that she is prepared to leave the EU without a formal deal rather sign up to a bad one. The final agreement on the UK's exit will need the approval of 20 out of the EU's 27 other member states as well as the support of the European Parliament. However, a future trade deal could need the backing of all EU states. There have been suggestions the UK could potentially exploit divisions within the EU over how hard a bargain they are willing to drive. Several EU leaders have insisted the UK cannot expect a better deal outside the EU than it has now and their priority is to protect the interests of the remaining 27 members. Others have advised against \"punishing\" the UK. Speaking after holding talks with Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern, Mr Juncker said there would be no parallel negotiations and the UK would not be allowed to conduct bilateral discussions in key areas such as finance, telecommunications or chemicals. \"A situation could arise whereby the UK might attempt to or wish to be obliging to certain member states in certain economic zones and certain sectors whereby those countries might wish to provide certain advantages to the UK,\" he said. \"It is in our interests therefore that we don't have any special discussions... with certain individual countries.\" Mr Kern said that Europe would not \"capitulate\" to the UK by granting it a better status than it would enjoy if it was still an EU member. \"If you want to be a member of a club you have better conditions, obviously, than if you want to be outside the club,\" he said. The EU's negotiating team will be headed up by former commissioner Michel Barnier. Speaking during a visit to Finland his UK counterpart, Brexit Secretary David Davis, said he wanted an outcome which was good for the EU as well as the UK. \"We're not talking about a break-up, we're talking about a new relationship, that's what we want to see,\" he said. The UK's former ambassador to the EU Sir Ivan Rogers has said the negotiations - which are scheduled to be completed in two years - will be \"humungous\" in scope.

{"article": "The 27-year-old dominated from the start, flooring his opponent in the 10th round and winning 120-108, 119-108 and 117-110 on the judges' scorecards. The belt could only be won by Yafai after the Panamanian was stripped of it when he failed to make the weight. Unbeaten in 21 professional fights, Yafai previously held the Commonwealth and British super-flyweight belts. The Birmingham fighter also won a silver medal at the 2010 European Championships during his amateur career. \"It's unbelievable, it's going to take a while to sink in,\" he said. \"I knew I was going to do it, it was just a matter of how. I just did what I needed to do. \"I can't wait to headline in Birmingham as a world champion. My hands are a bit sore so I might be out for a little bit, but the second I can get in the gym I will be back working and getting ready to defend this belt.\" The fight was part of a packed undercard as Britain's Anthony Joshua retained his IBF world heavyweight championship by knocking out American Eric Molina. Bury's Scott Quigg won his first fight since losing to Carl Frampton in February, and his first as a featherweight, outpointing Mexico's Jose Cayetano. Former super-bantamweight world champion Quigg, 28, had his jaw broken by Frampton but showed no signs of frailty on his return to the ring. Cayetano, himself fighting at 126lb for the first time, was unmoved by most of his opponent's punches until the end of the eighth round, when he began to wilt. And Quigg finished his rival off with a flashing left-right combination at close quarters, the referee calling a halt to proceedings with Cayetano on the deck. Quigg has plenty of options at featherweight. Frampton moved up and claimed the WBA featherweight title in July, Welshman Lee Selby is the IBF title-holder and Leeds' Josh Warrington is also in the hunt for a world title. Liverpool's Callum Smith stayed on course for a world title shot with a brutal 10th-round knockout of game Lancastrian Luke Blackledge. Referee Steve Gray could have stopped the fight earlier but allowed the one-sided battering to continue until Blackledge was knocked unconscious. There were an anxious few minutes as a prone Blackledge was administered oxygen before he gingerly, and mercifully, made it back to his feet. Smith, 26, successfully defended his British title for the first time and remained unbeaten in 22 pro fights, with 17 knockouts. He is ranked number one by the WBC but Sweden's Badou Jack is defending that belt against Britain's IBF champion James DeGale in January. In a thrilling light-heavyweight contest, Frank Buglioni stopped Hosea Burton in the 12th and final round to secure the British title. Manchester's Burton, 28, built an early lead behind his jab and some ramrod right hands, and the challenger's face was a bloody mess by the middle rounds. However, the Londoner's punches started to have an effect down the stretch and Burton went down under a barrage in the 11th. Midway through the 12th, Burton was stunned by a right to the temple before going down again. He clambered to his feet but the referee called things off after another assault by Buglioni, with a minute and four seconds remaining. Buglioni, 27, improves to 19 wins (15 KOs) and two defeats from 22 pro fights and could be rewarded with a second shot at a world title.

{"article": "In experiments on mice, the stem cells were genetically engineered to produce and secrete toxins which kill brain tumours, without killing normal cells or themselves. Researchers said the next stage was to test the procedure in humans. A stem cell expert said this was \"the future\" of cancer treatment. The study, published in the journal Stem Cells, was the work of scientists from Massachusetts General Hospital and the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. For many years, they had been researching a stem-cell-based therapy for cancer, which would kill only tumour cells and no others. They used genetic engineering to make stem cells that spewed out cancer-killing toxins, but, crucially, were also able to resist the effects of the poison they were producing. They also posed no risk to normal, healthy cells. In animal tests, the stem cells were surrounded in gel and placed at the site of the brain tumour after it had been removed. Their cancer cells then died as they had no defence against the toxins. Dr Khalid Shah, lead author and director of the molecular neurotherapy and imaging lab at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, said the results were very positive. \"After doing all of the molecular analysis and imaging to track the inhibition of protein synthesis within brain tumours, we do see the toxins kill the cancer cells.\" He added: \"Cancer-killing toxins have been used with great success in a variety of blood cancers, but they don't work as well in solid tumours because the cancers aren't as accessible and the toxins have a short half-life.\" But genetically engineering stem cells has changed all that, he said. \"Now, we have toxin-resistant stem cells that can make and release cancer-killing drugs.\" Chris Mason, professor of regenerative medicine at University College London, said: \"This is a clever study, which signals the beginning of the next wave of therapies. \"It shows you can attack solid tumours by putting mini pharmacies inside the patient which deliver the toxic payload direct to the tumour. \"Cells can do so much. This is the way the future is going to be.\" Nell Barrie, senior science information manager for Cancer Research UK, said it was an \"ingenious approach\". \"We urgently need better treatments for brain tumours and this could help direct treatment to exactly where it's needed. \"But so far the technique has only been tested in mice and on cancer cells in the lab, so much more work will need to be done before we'll know if it could help patients with brain tumours.\" She said this type of research could help boost survival rates and bring much-needed progress for brain cancers. Dr Shah now plans to test the technique using a number of different therapies on mice with glioblastoma, the most common brain tumour in human adults.

The UK Airprox Board monitors near-miss incidents. An Airprox is the official term for a situation where the distance between aircraft and their relative positions and speed were such that the safety of the aircraft may have been compromised. There were 70 Airprox reports involving drones coming close to aircraft over the UK in 2016 - more than double the number for 2015. There have been 33 incidents up to May 2017. The Civil Aviation Authority recommends drones be flown at no higher than 400ft. However, the highest Airprox involving a drone was at 12,500ft. Of the 142 Airprox incidents involving drones recorded since 2010, 40 of them were near to Heathrow. Six of them, up to May, had been near to Gatwick. In November 2016, the UK's drone code was revised and updated to help pilots ensure they fly the gadgets safely. The revised code turned the five main safety tips into a mnemonic, spelling drone, to make it easier to remember. UK revises safe flying drone code .

But numbers were down sharply compared with last year's event, when 1.4 million rallied in Barcelona alone. Spain has consistently blocked attempts to hold a referendum on secession. Catalan regional president Carles Puigdemont had urged support for \"converting Catalonia into an independent state\". Divisions have also emerged between the separatist movement's main political grouping in the Catalan parliament, the Together for Yes coalition, and its radical leftwing ally, the CUP. Mr Puigdemont, who took power in January, faces a confidence vote on 28 September. He advocates a negotiated withdrawal from Spain. When Catalan nationalists held an unofficial referendum on independence in November 2014, 80% of those who voted backed independence. Sunday is the \"Diada\", Catalonia's national day. It commemorates the moment in 1714 when Barcelona fell to troops loyal to Spain's King Philip V during the War of the Spanish Succession. \"We have to move towards the final outcome,\" 58-year-old office clerk Xavier Borras, who planned to attend the rally in Barcelona with a friend, told AFP news agency. \"We can't wait any longer.\" Spain's leading parties, deadlocked in their efforts to form a new government after two inconclusive general elections since December, have shown little sympathy for Catalan grievances.

Earlier, Chelsea cancelled their Premier League victory parade, which was due to take place on Sunday. The club say it would be \"inappropriate\" with the UK terror threat at its highest level after Monday's bombing killed 22 people and injured 64. Greater Manchester Police and the city council had already said athletics' Great CityGames could take place in Manchester on Friday evening. Now they have given the go-ahead for the Great Run, with additional security measures expected to be in force. Rahman, the council's executive member for culture and leisure, said: \"The Great CityGames and Great Manchester Run are two of the real highlights of Manchester's sporting calendar. \"We know that thousands of Mancunians have been looking forward to taking part, or cheering the athletes on, so I am pleased and proud to confirm that these fantastic events will be held as planned this weekend.\" Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford is among those lined up to take part on Friday, with Sunday's field including Ethiopia's triple Olympic champions Kenenisa Bekele and Tirunesh Dibaba. Chelsea had planned an open-top bus tour with the trophy and hoped to add the FA Cup in Saturday's final with Arsenal. The Gunners have also said they will not stage a parade should they win. A screening of the match at the club's Emirates Stadium has been cancelled and fans will be given refunds. Chelsea said players will make a donation to a fund supporting victims of the attack and they will wear black armbands for the final at Wembley, with a minute's silence beforehand. \"Everyone associated with Chelsea Football Club offers our heartfelt condolences to those affected by Monday's terror attack in Manchester,\" said a club statement. \"Our thoughts go out to all the victims and their families and friends.\" Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis said the safety of supporters and staff was paramount and the club had been in close contact with the security services. \"After taking their advice we have reluctantly taken the decision to cancel the screening and potential parade,\" he said. Spectators at all major events can expect to see more armed police and face longer security checks. Media playback is not supported on this device .

Sullivan and his eldest son Dave were moved by reports of a man named Steve who tended to children when the bomb went off at a concert being given by American singer Ariana Grande. West Ham's joint owner tracked down the homeless man after putting out an appeal on BBC Radio 5 live while his son took to social media. They are now working out a plan to pay his rent for the next six months, while also providing him with new clothes and opportunities to find work . \"Steve was just one of hundreds of people who forgot about their own safety and rushed to the aid of others, and we were both moved by his story,\" David Sullivan told 5 live. Media playback is not supported on this device . A minute's silence was observed before the Europa League final between Manchester United and Ajax in Stockholm on Wednesday and both wore black armbands. The opening ceremony was considerably reduced as a mark of respect for the victims. England and South Africa stood shoulder to shoulder for a minute's silence before the first match of the one-day cricket series at Headingley. Both teams wore black armbands as they took the field in Leeds, with all 15 members of the England squad lining up on the pitch alongside the tourists and umpires for a sombrely observed silence. Formula 1 is expected to observe a silence before this weekend's Monaco Grand Prix. F1's teams, the majority of which are based in Britain, have also agreed to have #Manchester on their cars. British driver Lewis Hamilton said he would be thinking of the victims. \"I am carrying them in my heart this weekend,\" said Hamilton. \"It is difficult to think about it and it is just crazy to think where we are in the world.\" Salford are to waive admission prices for their next rugby league match in return for donations to the appeal fund. Fans can obtain free tickets for the Red Devils' Super League match against Catalans Dragons at the AJ Bell Stadium on Friday night but will be asked to make a donation in return. \"Like everybody, I was shocked and outraged by the events of Monday night,\" said Salford owner Dr Marwan Koukash, a Palestinian refugee who became a self-made millionaire after coming to England to study.

The parade got under way in the West End with an increased visible police presence. For the first time, the Red Arrows will fly past the march and a rainbow flag is flying at Parliament. Justine Greening, Secretary of State for International Development, announced she is in a same-sex relationship as the event was in full swing. She tweeted: \"Today's a good day to say I'm in a happy same sex relationship, I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!\" Her announcement came as the director of Pride London, Michael Salter-Church, said this year's campaign slogan is No Filter. He said: \"No Filter is a call to arms. A call for people to be themselves, to live as their true selves. \"Now that might sound too obvious but too many people already self-censor. On this weekend whilst we celebrate the LGBT community, be your true selves, try and live without filter because that's a really important message that we want spread around the UK and the world.\" London Mayor Sadiq Khan also joined the celebratory parade and singer Alesha Dixon will entertain revellers. In a message before the march, he said London is \"a city where the large majority of people of all communities, faiths and backgrounds, don't simply tolerate each other, but respect, embrace and celebrate our diversity\". At the scene: BBC reporter Catriona Renton . What a carnival atmosphere! The buzz around the start of the parade was electric as we watched several people dressed as the character of Patsy from \"Absolutely Fabulous\" dancing on their bus with a giant high heeled shoe and lipstick on it. Then the real stars of the show Edina and Patsy herself cut the ribbon. Then they were off. Approximately 40,000 people from around 300 organisations paraded down Oxford Street in a sea of glitter and colour on their way to Trafalgar Square. There was silence as people here paused to remember the 49 victims of the shootings in Orlando who were killed two weeks ago. The message was of solidarity. The march takes place weeks after a gunman shot dead 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando in Florida. The Metropolitan Police said it will mount a visible police presence to provide reassurance to those taking part. Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe earlier said there was \"no intelligence\" to suggest the march or the city would be targeted, urging people to join in but \"take reasonable precaution\". Organisers expect that more people will attend the event this year to show support for the Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender community. Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, who was involved in organising the first Pride, said people must unite against hate and this year both gay and straight Muslims will join the parade in a show of solidarity. He said: \"In the wake of the horrific mass murder of LGBT people by an Islamist gunman in Orlando, we are highlighting the need for dialogue, unity and solidarity between the Muslim and LGBT communities - to oppose all hate.\" This year the parade will feature more than 100 Met Police officers and 200 military personnel, as the flypast will show support within the Armed Forces for the LGBT community.", "abstract": "Tens of thousands of people have joined the Pride parade through central London.", "candidate": "Tens of thousands of people have taken part in Pride London.", "doc_id": 141, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "Approximately 40,000 people from around 300 organisations paraded down Oxford Street in a sea of glitter and colour on their way to Trafalgar Square.", "explanation": "The summary claims \"tens of thousands\" of people, which is supported by the number 40,0000 in the source text.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

{"article": "Early indications are of wide variations nationwide, with up to one in six missing out on their first choice of school in some areas. While in other areas, almost all got their number one preference. It comes days after council leaders said two in five local authorities would have too few places by 2016. Pressure is growing, particularly in schools on London's fringes and in cities such as Leicester, Nottingham, Reading and Peterborough. However, in London, around 99,000 pupils or 95% received a place at one of their six preferred schools this year - up 1,100 and nearly five percentage points from last year. Of those, 81% got into their first preference school, the same proportion as the two previous years. But there were wide local variations within the capital. In Kensington and Chelsea, only 59% got their first preference, while in Barking and Dagenham it was 91%. This comes against a backdrop of an extra 900 applications in the capital this year. The crisis has been precipitated mainly by a booming birth-rate, partly by immigration and by families moving specifically to be near popular schools. The demand for school places has risen steeply in Harrow, which has some very good primary schools. It was predicted to be 12% over capacity by this September but the council said it had worked really hard to ensure there are enough places for Harrow children this year. A spokesman said the crush Harrow was seeing now was very likely to affect other areas around the country soon. Initial results from a Press Association survey of town halls shows families in some areas are more likely to gain a place at their top choice than in others. Results from Birmingham show 84.7% of children starting reception have got a place at their first preference, while 94.8% got one of their listed choices. Around one in 20 applicants - 826 children - were given a school that was not one of their preferred options. A further 3.3% - 532 youngsters - have been offered a school outside the city. Figures from East Sussex show 84.68% got their first choice, while in Southampton the percentage was 85.4%. In Derbyshire, 93.4% of youngsters received their first pick, in Torbay it was 86.2%, Bristol was 84% - up from 82% last year, and in Cornwall it was 90.7%. In Kent the figure was was 85.81%, up slightly from 84.9% last year. Labour and the National Association of Head Teachers also blame the coalition government's free-school policy, which has allowed some new schools to be opened in areas that already have surplus places. At the same time, the ability of local authorities to plan for population surges has been reduced by regulations requiring any new schools to be either an academy or a free school, rather than a council school. NAHT general secretary Russell Hobby said: \"We have a balkanised system with authorities, academies and central government taking decisions in isolation.\" He added: \"There is a desperate need for long-term planning that spans all sectors. With the massive increase in pupil numbers and over-stretched budgets, we cannot afford inefficiency and conflict.\" The Local Government Association said the escalating places shortage was one of the key areas that needed to be tackled by the next government. Earlier this month, it said schools were \"reaching their limits and could soon run out of space and money for extra places\" and there would be a need for an extra 880,000 pupils at a cost of \u00c2\u00a312bn. The Conservatives blame Labour for the problem saying the party \"cut over 200,000 primary school places - and even ignored official warnings to provide extra school places after a baby boom\". A spokesman added: \"The Conservatives have created over 400,000 school places. There are fewer children in overcrowded primary schools and, most importantly, one million more children in good or outstanding schools since 2010.\" Labour points out that under the Conservative-Lib Dem administration the number of infant children in classes with more than 30 pupils has more than trebled from 31,265 in 2010 to 102,615 in 2015. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt blamed the Conservatives for spending \"hundreds of millions of taxpayers' money on a few free schools in areas where there are no shortages of places\". But Natalie Evans, director of New Schools Network, said: \"Over 90% of primary free schools opened or approved to open are in areas where new school places are needed. But they are also offering new choices in areas of low standards.\" Liberal Democrat schools minister David Laws said: \"It's astonishing that Labour and the Conservatives won't properly fund these children. It will be impossible to provide a place for every child and raise standards unless we protect education budgets.\" Ty Goddard, co-founder of think-tank Education Foundation, said England's vast education property estate could be used with more imagination, but called for the parties to work together on solving the school places issue.

They were a man followed by two women,\" he says. \"They looked scared, they didn't alert us to anything, they ran to the end of my carriage and used their key to open a service door. Then they locked the door after them.\" Carriage 11 was in the front half of the train and the locked door allowed staff access to a service area, which was off limits to passengers. Then other people started running through from carriage 12. Some were covered in blood, others said they had seen a man with a gun shooting people. \"There we were, with nowhere to go. There were probably 20 to 30 of of us, including the French actor Jean-Hugues Anglade and his family. We didn't know anything.\" Anglade, who injured his hand as he tried to activate the train's alarm, has also spoken about members of train staff locking themselves in a private cabin, complaining that they could have led passengers to a luggage area in another part of the train. He told Paris Match (in French) \"We shouted for the staff to let us in, we yelled 'open!' There was no response.\" Agnes Ogier, the boss of Thalys, has said there will be an internal investigation and the staff involved will be asked to \"explain their behaviour during this dramatic event\". Jamie Robinson says after 10 terrifying minutes a man entered their carriage and explained there had been a man with a gun but the situation was now under control. Afterwards he learned this was Anthony Sadler, one of the American passengers who helped overpower the attacker. \"The relief just exploded. We were all in such painful shock,\" he recalls. After learning they were safe Jamie Robinson and other passengers in his coach remained where they were, in numb silence, until they reached Arras station where the suspect, Ayoub El-Khazzani, a 25-year-old Moroccan, was arrested. Four days on from the traumatic events, Mr Robinson still can't understand why the train staff did nothing to help the passengers. He even believes the three staff may have jumped off the train as it slowly moved into Arras station. \"They must have some responsibility, not to attack the attacker but some training to alert passengers. There was nothing. They got out, they saved themselves. They locked us in that compartment.\" He says he will never be able to forget the heroic actions of those who tackled the gunman. \"My life was in their hands. Whether they think it's heroic or not, they have helped so many people and we are forever indebted. It's a phenomenal reaction and action that they have had.\" Three Americans - Spencer Stone, Alek Skarlatos, Anthony Sadler - and Briton Chris Norman were presented with the Legion d'honneur at the Elysee Palace by President Francois Hollande.

{"article": "It is one of a number of measures being considered by the government in its consultation on curbing corporate pay. Other proposals include improving the effectiveness of remuneration committees and votes on pay packages. It comes after Theresa May appeared to row back from plans to force companies to appoint employees to their boards. The government's green paper, published this week, aims to increase public trust in business in the face of the rise in anti-globalisation and anti-business sentiment. Its proposals will include: . As part of the plan to reform remuneration committees, the government is considering whether employees' representatives should be given an advisory role. Officials believe their input would spell out to the committee the impact on the wider workforce of high levels of remuneration for top executives. In September trade union body the TUC said its research showed the average FTSE 100 boss was paid 123 times the average full-time salary, and that the median pay award of major FTSE 100 directors had risen by 47% in five years to 2015 to \u00c2\u00a33.4m. As part of the proposed shake-up, civil servants have looked at measures being taken in other countries including the US, France and Australia. A government source said: \"Businesses are a pillar of our society, creating employment opportunities and contributing significantly to funding our country's public services. \"The UK has led the world in corporate governance, but our strong reputation can only be maintained if government and business regularly reviews and upgrades our governance. \"Good governance helps companies take better decisions, for their own long-term benefit and the economy overall - ensuring public trust in British business and making sure the UK is the best place in the world to do business.\" The publication of the green paper comes after Mrs May was forced to reject claims she had watered down plans for workers to have a say in how their companies are run. She ruled out imposing the appointment of employees to company boards when she gave a talk to the CBI this week. Days later the the Bank of England's chief economist, Andy Haldane, joined company chiefs to reject proposals for annual binding votes on pay and the publication of pay ratios. The two ideas were among the prime minister's suggestions to address public unease about executive pay. A report by the Big Innovation Centre think tank argued that a binding vote would mean Britain's top firms losing out on top talent. It also said that pay ratios do not \"lend themselves to valid comparisons between companies\" and would likely add to misunderstanding over executive pay as well as potentially creating \"perverse incentives\".

{"article": "Joao Santana was widely seen as the architect of Ms Rousseff's 2010 and 2014 election victories. He has denied receiving bribes in a scheme to divert funds from the state-run oil company Petrobras. About 50 Brazilian politicians, including the leader of the lower house of Congress, are under investigation in the Petrobras corruption scandal. Mr Santana is accused of receiving bribes from several large engineering conglomerates. Analysts say the charge against him is a further blow for President Rousseff who is facing impeachment proceedings. He was arrested in February after he returned from the Dominican Republic, where he was working on the re-election campaign of President Danilo Medina. Because of his proximity to her, the arrest is expected to damaged her standing further, even though impeachment proceedings against her are not related to the Petrobras corruption investigation.

And he had harsh words for the investigation, saying that Brazil was currently living in a \"climate of persecution\". If the investigating judge accepts the allegations against him, Mr Santana will be jailed. In Brasilia, a special Senate commission has begun hearings ahead of a vote on whether the whole Senate should take on impeachment proceedings against President Rousseff.

{"article": "The former Manchester United striker, best known for his winning goal against Bayern Munich in the 1999 Champions League final, arrived with great fanfare in January 2014. He presented a different vision for Cardiff compared with the defensive approach of his predecessor Malky Mackay, renowned for an unspectacular, yet effective style that gained the club promotion to the Premier League in 2013. Mackay's success meant popularity with fans and that probably didn't help Solskjaer's cause. The Scot's bitter falling-out with the club's Malaysian owner Vincent Tan had disillusioned many supporters who saw Mackay's sacking as a regression for a club who had fought so hard for a top-flight return after half a century away. He may have promised a more exciting style, but under Solskjaer the Bluebirds slipped into the Premier League's bottom three for the first time and never recovered, finishing bottom. The results were shocking - 3-0 at Swansea, 6-3 against Liverpool, 3-0 defeats against Crystal Palace and Newcastle and 4-0 losses to Hull and Sunderland. Tan blamed Mackay for relegation, which was confirmed at the penultimate game of the season, and expected a swift Premier League return under the Norwegian. And so began a big recruitment drive in the summer. Nine players came in, many of Mackay's men left, but it seemed even with so many new faces Solskjaer didn't know what his best team was. He named a different starting 11 for all of the games he oversaw this season and his tinkering was deemed to have had an adverse effect on results. Two home defeats in succession, against Norwich and Middlesbrough, sealed his fate. The nature of the capitulation against the Canaries caused particular concern, Cardiff leading 2-0 before conceding four second-half goals to lose 4-2. During the 1-0 loss against Boro four days later, the Cardiff crowd vented their frustration at the Norwegian, booing him as he tried to get the ball to one of his players to take a throw-in. After the game the Norwegian said he accepted the blame for the club's poor run of form. \"I'm responsible and I should get better results than we've had in the first seven games,\" said Solskjaer, who seems to have the ability to remain upbeat in the most trying of circumstances. The manager may be responsible for the team but many feel the board, and particularly owner Vincent Tan, have to take some responsibility too. \"It was the wrong appointment for Cardiff and the wrong club for Solskjaer,\" said former Cardiff captain Jason Perry on BBC Radio Wales. \"Do we know how Cardiff City play? No. \"I think only four players played against Blackburn [in the Championship opener] that played against Middlesbrough. He picked a different back four yet again. \"If you're manager or a coach you have a central strategy and you work on that.\" Solskjaer will not have the chance to find a strategy that works and attention now turns to the next man to work under Tan. Early favourites include Welshman Tony Pulis, who would be popular with fans given the job he did at Crystal Palace last season, and Dundee's Paul Hartley, who has overseen his club's rise to the Scottish Premiership.

{"article": "Red Bull motorsport boss Helmut Marko told Germany's Bild newspaper: \"The idea of Mercedes is finished. We are now focusing elsewhere.\" Team principal Christian Horner said he was doing \"necessary due diligence\" in talking to other manufacturers. With their partnership with Renault disintegrating, the team may be forced to switch to Ferrari engines. Mercedes are understood to be against supplying Red Bull - who are contracted to Renault until 2016 - because they do not want to help a strong rival become more competitive. Media playback is not supported on this device . The German giant is also concerned about what it and many other F1 insiders perceive to be Red Bull's history of antagonistic relationships with engine partners. Red Bull's relationship with Renault has been difficult for some time, and appears to have become untenable in recent months as the team's frustrations with the lack of competitiveness of the French engine boil over. Honda is the only other manufacturer in F1, but partner McLaren would almost certainly exercise their veto over any potential deal with Red Bull, who in any case are not believed to be interested in a deal with the Japanese company at this stage. Renault, which supplies only Red Bull and sister team Toro Rosso in F1, is in the final stages of negotiations to take over the financially troubled Lotus team, although no deal has yet been completed. Ferrari team principal Maurizio Arrivabene said the Italian company was prepared to supply Red Bull if necessary. He said he was not concerned about their reputation for being able to build highly-competitive chassis in F1, led by their design chief Adrian Newey.

{"article": "Lower down this article . The top players, forced to enter from the beginning of the 128-man event, will come up against some unfamiliar names in the first round before the BBC's live coverage begins with the second round on Saturday. Former world champion and BBC Sport pundit Ken Doherty, who plays world number 89 Mitchell Mann on Thursday, assesses the contenders and possible stories that could emerge at the Barbican Centre. Most of the leading players have won a tournament so far this season. Four-time UK champion Ronnie O'Sullivan managed to retain his Champion of Champions crown in Coventry, while defending UK champion Neil Robertson triumphed at the Wuxi Classic in June. Judd Trump won the Australian Open and Mark Selby, whose wife gave birth to their first child earlier this month, claimed a European Tour event in Latvia. Ding Junhui, winner of five ranking titles last season, continued where he left off by winning the first Asian Tour event. The man going into the tournament in excellent form is Shaun Murphy. The 2008 UK champion made a 147 break in last week's European Tour event in Germany. Remarkably, it was his third attempt at a maximum during the event, having previously failed on the final blue and final green. Ken Doherty's view: You will see the usual suspects in the latter stages. Ronnie O'Sullivan has been in superb form and Shaun Murphy was outstanding in Germany, topping it off with a 147 break. Ding has had a consistent few years and it enjoyed his first major win in the UK in 2005. The public always love watching Judd Trump, he is so exciting. Maybe this tournament might have come too soon for Mark Selby because there is a bit of upheaval when a child is born. When my son came along in 2007, I was at the UK a couple of days later and I was floating on air and very proud to be a new father. It took a bit of focus away from my snooker that week, there is no doubt about it. I ended up going out in the first round against Nigel Bond. On the evidence of O'Sullivan's performances at the Champion of Champions event, he will be the man to beat. Having compiled four centuries in the final against Judd Trump, The Rocket - usually his own harshest critic - stated afterwards, \"I think I am playing better than I ever have.\" An added motivation will be the chance to surpass Stephen Hendry's record of 775 career centuries. O'Sullivan is currently on 764 and could achieve the feat in York. However, his results in the two ranking events he has entered this season were disappointing. A first-round round loss to Alan McManus in the Shanghai Masters was followed by a quarter-final defeat against Mark Williams at the International Championship. Doherty's view: O'Sullivan will be the favourite. The way he has been playing the last couple of years, I think he is getting better with age. He is more of a complete player than he has ever been. He hasn't slowed down on his scoring prowess because his break building is as good as ever. What you are seeing from him now is a more complete package. He doesn't spit the dummy out like he would have done a few years ago and doesn't lose his focus. He is hungrier than he has ever been. The game needs players like him. There is no doubt that he is the man to beat because he sets the barometer for all the other players. Ali Carter competes in his biggest event since making a comeback to the sport after treatment for lung cancer. This season, the 35-year-old won the General Cup title in Hong Kong - his first event since being diagnosed in May - by beating Murphy 7-6 in the final. Carter, who has also overcome testicular cancer, was set to return to action at a European Tour event in Bulgaria in October but was advised to rest after pain in his left arm prevented him from practising. He faces China's Zhang Anda in the first round in York. Media playback is not supported on this device . Doherty's view: It is a fantastic story. Ali has always been a top player and has had his hardships away from the table. He is a brave lad and fought every challenge that has been put in front of him. The cancer was his biggest challenge and it is good to see him back. He is well liked and has the heart of a lion. He will get a great reception from the crowd and that may just inspire him. He had almost six months out and will have been resting after undergoing treatment. He would have got back on the table as soon as he summoned up the strength and that will have taken courage in itself. To do so well in his comeback tournament was remarkable. He will be putting in a lot of work now. The revamped 128-man draw means the top 16 players have lost their protection in ranking events, having previously gone through automatically to the last-32 stage. A further change this year sees the semi-finals reduced from a best-of-17 frames to a best-of-11. \"I don't like the changes to the semi-finals,\" said title holder Robertson. \"I thought the best-of 17 was what kept the prestige of the UK Championship, but this is something I don't agree with at all. \"It is very unfortunate for the tournament but the better player will win, although as a player you prefer the longer matches, especially in the semi-final and final.\" Doherty's view: The format is a fair reflection and it needs to be done for a money list where all players play in the same round like in tennis and golf.

{"article": "For the past six weeks or so, he has driven his green Lamborghini to the UFC's new performance institute on a daily basis. At this hub, located about four miles from the city's famous strip, you can mimic conditions at 10,000ft of altitude, clock miles on an underwater treadmill, or analyse the density of specific muscles. If an athlete is to be built rather than born, this is the place. The attention to detail is stunningly intricate and it was Manchester City's own training complex which offered key elements of the blueprint. A group of journalists are led through the $14m development by Forrest Griffin, a retired UFC light-heavyweight champion and now a vice-president with focus on athlete development. He paints details around what we see at the 30,000 square feet facility, which opened in May. Some 23 years have passed since UFC was formed but this building is seen as a game changer which will take the welfare and performance of athletes to new levels. It is far removed from the spit and sawdust gyms which shaped some of boxing's greatest names. Some 24 hours earlier, I visited the Mayweather Boxing Gym, a world-renowned facility which inside is straightforward, humble and brilliantly effective. But the UFC institute cuts with tradition in pursuit of gains. Measurability, science and mapped progress shape the mantra. Griffin explains how recovery is meticulously plotted. He points to one of his own injuries and a subsequent substantial difference in mass between his two quad muscles, detected after his retirement. A UFC fighter at the Institute would be scanned during rehabilitation to highlight which muscles have suffered during their lay-off so targeted rebuilding can be done. Any fighter competing under the UFC banner can train here at no cost. Tailored workout programmes appear on screens next to weight stations. If an athlete is only here for a short spell, their data and subsequent training plan will be sent to an app to use at their traditional base. Whatever the goal - recovery, strength, mobility, technique - there is a desire to offer a menu of ways to work on it. As Griffin stresses, what works for one individual will do nothing for another. In the recovery area, for example, athletes can opt for use of a cryotherapy chamber or laser-light therapy. Both will stimulate circulation, flushing away lactic acid and easing aches and pains. Facilities are purposely placed one room apart to ease access. We pass through a door and Griffin fires up the underwater treadmill McGregor has been filmed using in recent weeks. \"Conor has had a knee injury in the past so he doesn't like to do roadwork,\" says Griffin, 38. \"So he does a lot of bike work and he uses this as it has no impact on your body and you can work hard.\" Two pools next to the underwater treadmill offer temperatures of 105F and 50F respectively to again offer variety in recovery. Griffin explains why McGregor's typical routine of sleeping in until midday makes perfect sense. \"He's been here once or twice a day for six weeks,\" adds Griffin. \"Training at the time you fight is under appreciated. When do you work out the best, after being up for 12 hours or three or four hours? He primes his body to do that, which is intelligent.\" We are taken to meet UFC flyweight Joe Benevidez, who is receiving treatment from director of physical therapy Heather Linden. Linden left a role at the USA's Olympic Training Centre in Colorado Springs to be here. She jokes when explaining how even the toughest UFC fighters can struggle on a pilates ball when she isolates their weakest muscles in order to highlight where work is needed. \"What's been a shock is how little access to services these athletes have had in the past,\" she says. \"It's amazing how some of them have never had medical guidance for preventative measures. \"I've had to build trust. I had a guy come in here and tell me he couldn't feel his left arm but he was going to fight. He was scared of telling people in the event he was pulled from competing but with work we restored him to full functionality in two weeks.\" Former UFC welterweight Dan Hardy is part of the tour. The Nottingham-born 35-year-old describes the facilities as \"night and day\" to what he used. \"My life would be different now,\" he tells the group. \"I used to work with friends for treatment, driving around for different things I needed.\" Despite all the technology in what feels like the slickest of finishing schools, MMA critics still exist. Perhaps blighted by images of the ground and pound or blood-stained faces they question the morality of the sport. But UFC's growth shows no sign of relenting. The company was sold for $4.2bn in 2016 and listening to Griffin it is obvious this is a sport with vision. Mapping the layout of the Institute saw the UFC research facilities at the likes of Man City, the Phoenix Suns basketball team and the USA Olympic team base. Habits were observed, such as an athlete's occasional tendency to neglect post-workout nutrition if access to it was not made easy. Consequently, UFC athletes can only exit the building by passing a nutritional team. \"We learned from mistakes people had made in the past,\" adds Griffin. \"A facility and its staff may be too spread out. Manchester City have a great layout. The locker room is the centre of the building. The athletes start and end in the locker room so you build every service around that. \"Every sport taxes the human body a certain way. The needs and demands change but the impact on the body and the recovery needed is very similar.\" Media playback is not supported on this device .

{"article": "But the co-founder and chief executive of UK chocolate shop chain Hotel Chocolat says he was actually inspired to set up his own business after seeing the success of his father's other company - a printing firm. Since the first Hotel Chocolat store opened in 2004 the company has gone on to grow into a multi-million pound empire, with 81 shops, eight cafes, two restaurants, and a hotel. As soon as Mr Thirlwell, 51, starts talking, there's no mistaking what drove the firm's evolution. He speaks about chocolate with such evangelical zeal he is bouncing up and down in his chair. Talking wistfully about the 18th Century, when chocolate houses were all the rage in London, Mr Thirlwell admits that his fantasy is to \"make cocoa the hero\" again - educating people to recognise and appreciate the higher cocoa content in the chocolate Hotel Chocolat produces compared to some of the best-known brands. \"We want consumers to be having the same debate about the flavours of different cocoa beans as wine,\" he says. Mr Thirlwell's desire to educate extends to leaving chocolates he thinks people should like on the shelves even when they're not selling. The firm's 100% dark chocolate products, for example, took five years to become profitable. Yet using large amounts of cocoa doesn't come cheap, and the firm's \"Signature Cabinet\", which has three drawers full of chocolates, costs a whopping \u00a3160. But Mr Thirlwell says the pricing makes sense if you look at the cost of the cocoa hit, as well as the packaging. He points out that by contrast, the firm's entry level \"Selector\" range starts from \u00a33.75. \"It's very important to us that we're accessible,\" he adds. Such a wide-ranging pricing structure seems to work with customers, as the company enjoyed sales of \u00a370m in the year to the end of June 2013. And it is continuing to expand apace. Hotel Chocolat's rapid development has been helped by the creation of innovative chocolate bonds, through which it has raised around \u00a35m from investors, to whom it pays \"interest\" in chocolate. Mr Thirlwell picked up the business bug working for his father's printing firm in his school holidays. He says it gave him a strong sense that running a company was \"exciting\". Nonetheless, he \"didn't have a clue\" what he wanted to do with life until he got a job at a French hi-tech firm as part of his French and economics degree. The lure of business was so strong, he dropped out of his course altogether, staying on in France to help the company export its products. It was on his return to the UK that Mr Thirlwell met Hotel Chocolat's co-founder Peter Harris, who interviewed him for a sales and marketing job at another tech firm. They hit it off so well that just 10 months later, they left together and in 1987 set up Hotel Chocolat's forerunner - The Mint Marketing Company (MMC), which sold packaged mints branded with company logos. Mr Thirlwell got the idea for the business after his father told him that the most successful promotion the printing company had been involved with was for such a product. To fund MMC Mr Thirlwell and Mr Harris both took out \u00a35,000 personal loans. Unfortunately, the wrapping machine they'd bought didn't work, and they had to hand wrap 20,000 packs to make their first order. Mr Thirlwell admits many people would have seen this as a sign that it wasn't meant to be, but he says that this is \"rubbish\". \"Lots of businesses have some early setbacks,\" he says. \"You've just got to overcome them somehow. \"These things happen all the time even when you're established. You just swat them away more easily.\" MMC evolved into Choc Express when their customers asked if they had anything beyond mints, and they started selling chocolates online in 1993, becoming one of the UK's earliest e-retailers. Then in 2004 they opened their first store in Watford, after changing the name of the business to Hotel Chocolat. But why would a retail business wish to call itself a hotel? Mr Thirlwell says: \"It was aspirational. I was trying to come up with something that expressed the power that chocolate has to lift you out of your current mood and take you to a better place.\" \"Everyone agreed 'chocolat' sounded better than chocolate. It's almost onomatopoeia, and suggests how the chocolate melts in your mouth.\" A decade later, the business does own a hotel, which it built in Saint Lucia beside its own cocoa plantation, which provides some of the cocoa for its chocolates. The company also now has two restaurants, one in London and one in Leeds, serving sweet and savoury dishes that include cocoa. Plus it has stores in Copenhagen. And from originally outsourcing production of its chocolates, Hotel Chocolat now makes them all itself at its own factory in Cambridgeshire. Despite Hotel Chocolat's expansion, not a single part of the range gets onto the shelves without first being approved by Mr Thirlwell. He chairs a tasting session every Wednesday, where they try new recipes and combinations, and calls this the \"triage\" of the brand quality. \"It's the beginning of the product, so if I let anything past there that I'm not happy with - it could affect the brand.\" Customers can also get in on the act via the firm's Tasting Club - a monthly box of new chocolates which members test and score. The club now has 100,000 members who have given the business a vast range of data on the public's tastes. A chocolate containing thyme oil has so far scored worst, generating \"sackfuls of mail\". \"But if you get bull's-eyes for all of them you almost think you're not pushing the boundaries enough,\" says Mr Thirlwell. He admits pushing boundaries is also part of \"future proofing\" the business. \"If you're specialist you've got to be absolutely specialist.

{"article": "The 25-year-old Catholic constable died when a bomb exploded under his car in Omagh on Saturday. A number of dignitaries including NI First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness are at the requiem mass. Members of his Gaelic football club joined his police colleagues in a highly symbolic guard of honour. 'Appalling' No group has claimed responsibility for the attack but dissident republicans have been blamed. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster on Wednesday morning, Irish prime minister Enda Kenny strongly condemned the attack. \"To those who think they are doing something for Ireland, this is a warped mentality,\" he said. \"It is the mentality of the past, a very dark and violent past and it has no part in the future.\" He said Constable Kerr had been in the \"prime of life\" and it was \"appalling\" for his life to be taken from him. \"It does nothing for any community in this country,\" he added. The Gaelic Athletic Association administers a number of sports including Gaelic football and hurling which are among the most popular in Ireland. Unprecedented . Its joint involvement with the PSNI in the funeral service is unprecedented and has been described as highly symbolic. The GAA previously banned the security forces from being members but this rule was lifted after the PSNI was formed out of the Royal Ulster Constabulary in 2001. Dissident republicans remain opposed to the police and have repeatedly targeted officers in both gun and bomb attacks. Last year, Peadar Heffron, who captained the PSNI Gaelic football team, had a leg amputated after a similar booby-trap attack on his car. Constable Kerr was a member of the Beragh Red Knights GAA club. Its chairman Gerard Treacy said it was right that the GAA and the PSNI should \"show solidarity with one another\" at the funeral. \"Our community has been attacked and so the community of the PSNI been attacked and today shoulder to shoulder we will stand together in solidarity and show the people of Ireland and the world that this sort of despicable action is not going to be tolerated,\" he said. 'Overwhelming' messages . NI Secretary Owen Paterson is representing the British Government at the funeral. It is also being attended by Irish opposition leader Micheal Martin, the Ulster Unionist Party leader Tom Elliott and several NI church leaders. PSNI Chief Constable Matt Baggott and his counterpart from the Irish police Martin Callinan are also present. Catholic primate Cardinal Sean Brady is leading the funeral mass and Father John Skinnader, a cousin of Ronan's mother Nuala, is giving the homily. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has organised a lunchtime rally in Belfast on Wednesday to allow people to express their abhorrence at the killing. Books of condolence have been opened across Northern Ireland, while on its Facebook page the PSNI said it had been \"overwhelmed by messages of sympathy and support\". On Tuesday, the Crimestoppers charity offered a \u00c2\u00a350,000 reward for information leading to those responsible for the murder. Constable Kerr, who joined the police in May 2010, is the second officer to have been killed since the Royal Ulster Constabulary became the PSNI in 2001. Constable Stephen Carroll was shot dead in a gun attack in Craigavon in March 2009. Constable Kerr is survived by his mother, Nuala, a widow, two brothers, Cathair and Aaron and a sister, Dairine. 1.

{"article": "It was unanimously passed by MPs in December, but Mr Koroma refused to sign it after protests by religious leaders. After consultations, MPs returned the bill to him last month, unaltered. The law would allow women to terminate a pregnancy in any circumstances up to 12 weeks and in cases of incest, rape and foetal impairment up to 24 weeks. Abortion is currently illegal in Sierra Leone under any circumstances. Human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and five Sierra Leonean organisations, wrote to President Koroma in February urging him to give the bill his assent. \"Unsafe abortions - often resulting from restrictive laws and poor access to sexual and reproductive health services, information, and education - is one of the main factors contributing to maternal deaths in Sierra Leone,\" their letter said. The World Health Organization estimates that Sierra Leone has the world's highest maternal mortality ratio at 1,360 deaths per 100,000 live births last year. The BBC's Umaru Fofana in the capital, Freetown, says the abortion issue has led to heated debates and protests on both sides. President Koroma has now referred the controversial legislation to the Constitutional Review Committee, which is currently reviewing the constitution. Our correspondent says it will decide whether to include the abortion law in its recommended changes to the constitution, which will be put to a referendum. When President Koroma sent the legislation back to parliament in January, he asked for it to be reviewed after consultation with religious and women's groups as it went beyond an African Union protocol on women's rights which only backs abortion in cases of sexual assault and in medical emergencies. Under Sierra Leone's current constitution, the president cannot veto a bill which received a two-thirds majority in parliament, our reporter says. The speaker of the house could sign the Safe Abortion Act into law, but our correspondent says he is highly unlikely to do so as he comes from the president's party. Mr Koroma met leaders from the Inter Religious Council of Sierra Leone (IRCSL), who all oppose abortion, in January, saying they \"represent a huge constituency across the country\". Catholic Archbishop Tamba Charles, vice-president of IRCSL, reiterated their view at summit on the issue later in the month declaring: \"No life can be destroyed on the basis of choice as life is sacred. \"If they want to fight for the right of women, then let them be provided with the required medical facilities that will help reduce maternal mortality rate in the country,\" Sierra Leone's Politico news website quotes him as saying.

Substitute Elyounoussi produced a fine shot on the turn in the 87th minute and another replacement Ruud made it 3-0 to Norway with a fine volley. Northern Ireland started well but rarely threatened in the second half. Before the goals, home skipper Steven Davis, Martin Paterson and Gareth McAuley were all thwarted during a frantic goalmouth scramble. It means Northern Ireland have won just one of their last 14 friendlies. They started brightly with full-back Ryan McGivern's drive being tipped away by goalkeeper Rune Jarstein. Northern Ireland were knocking the ball about well and the atmosphere at Windsor Park seemed optimistic. However, O'Neill's men were unable to make the breakthrough and were hit by Norway's opening goal in the 44th minute. Aaron Hughes half-cleared a corner as far as Nordtveit, whose shot beat Camp via the unfortunate Clingan. Grant McCann, a half-time substitute, had a decent crack at goal soon after the break with his 25-yard drive being tipped away by Jarstein. Paddy McCourt came on with just over 20 minutes to go, replacing Shane Ferguson. The Celtic man was watched from the stands by club boss Neil Lennon, returning to the ground where he was once barracked by his own fans on international duty. David Healy then came on as a substitute to become Northern Ireland's most capped outfield player on 92, passing Mal Donaghy. Elyounoussi extended the visitors' lead three minutes from time when he beat Camp at the near post with a fine shot.

{"article": "\"This is where it all happens,\" says the star, who has scored more number one singles (seven) than any other British artist this decade, as he welcomes the BBC to his studio. It's a pristine room, free of clutter and distractions, except for a PlayStation 4 and several years' worth of Fifa games. On the mixing desk sits a book on Frank Gehry's architecture, while the far corner is dominated by a gargantuan bean bag, apparently fashioned from the skin of a dead muppet. Outside the sliding glass doors, Tinie has a child-sized Lamborghini, which he's planning to use in an upcoming video. \"Jake Bugg has been here,\" he says. \"MNEK's been here. Sinead Harnett was here the other day. \"Lewis Hamilton came here not long ago - but not to do a guest vocal.\" The studio has been Tinie's second home since 2008. He recorded his million-selling debut Disc-Overy here. And it's where he's been obsessing over his third album, Youth, for more than two years. The record has suffered a number of delays as the star revised and refined the tracklist. Part of the problem was that, after five years of success, he'd lost touch with his roots. \"I've been on the road literally since I released Pass Out,\" he says. \"I've been in my own world and my own head. \"My engineer Ritchie said, 'You know how you'd be able to nail this album? Move back into your mum's house. Take all your stuff and live your life from there.' \"But obviously you can't do that. It would just be too annoying. So what I did instead was make sure I met up with all my friends and did the things I did before this all happened. \"That was the creativity behind the album, catching up with my friends.\" You can hear it in the music. There's a playfulness and warmth that was missing from Tinie's second album Demonstration, which found the rapper struggling to come to terms with fame. He symbolically scratched his eyes out on the cover, fearing he'd become too much of a \"personality\". On Youth, he steps back and counts his blessings. \"It was such a strange thing to be a British rapper when I started,\" he says. \"People were like, 'Oh, you're rapping with an English accent? Naaaah.' \"Now that's changed. Look at the likes of Stormzy and Dave - there's a plethora of British rappers. It's an accepted genre now. It means something to British culture on a mainstream level.\" Tinie was born Patrick Chukwuemeka Okogwu Jr, and spent his early years in Peckham's notoriously rough Aylesbury estate. But by the time he was 12, his father, a barber turned social worker, and mother, an NHS administrator, had saved up enough money to move the family to the quiet, leafy suburbs of Plumstead. Patrick picked up his parents' work ethic, gaining A-Levels in media studies, religious studies and psychology - but was seduced by music after seeing So Solid Crew on TV. Rap, he suddenly realised, didn't have to come from the other side of the Atlantic. He took a job selling double glazing to fund his early recordings, and emerged as part of the grime scene with tracks like Wifey and Tears. Soon he was developing his own sound - a futuristic mix of hip-hop, synth-pop and space-age dub, laced with a wry awareness of rap cliche. \"I got so many clothes I keep 'em in my aunt's house,\" he quipped on his breakout hit Pass Out. He acknowledges his musical progression on a new song called Not for the Radio. \"Eight years sitting on top/Hip-hop, grime, then I went pop.\" Yet for all his chart-busting collaborations with pop stars like Ellie Goulding and Jess Glynne, he hasn't forgotten his roots. \"I listen to grime still, I go to events, I partake in the music,\" he says. What impresses him most about the new generation of artists is their self-reliance - in particular Skepta and Stormzy, who've hit the big time while recording and releasing songs on their own labels. \"Against all the odds, they're setting up their own infrastructure, putting out records, creating their own hype and achieving things that, five years ago, you could only have achieved on a major label,\" marvels the rapper. Tinie also retains the rights to his music, while licensing it to Warner Music subsidiary Parlophone. Grime's success is particularly encouraging because, he says, it \"was almost like the uninvited genre\". He says: \"People have likened it to punk but I feel like, for some reason, it wasn't embraced. It got pushed to the side. \"I think that's basically changed now. We get to be ourselves and make hits, just like everybody else.\" He addresses the genre's success on another album track, Lightwork: \"Black boys getting white paper/From the underground, now we're in the skyscraper.\" Reconnecting with friends while making Youth, Tinie realised that obsessing over his career had robbed him of other experiences. But it's a price he says was worth paying. \"A lot of my mates from school are married, some of them have got kids, some of them have got two or three,\" he reflects. \"It's weird: I can be sitting with a friend, telling them about all the amazing things I've seen on tour. Like, 'I played in the Maldives in an underwater club!' Or, 'I did the Olympics!' And they'll be sitting there thinking, 'Wow, I'd love to do what you're doing.' \"But equally, they can tell you, 'Mate, I just got married. You missed the wedding. And now my wife is expecting her first child.' And I'll be like, 'Wow, you're getting on with your life and it seems like you're really happy.' \"But I don't feel I'm missing out. If you ask any musician who's operating at a certain level, you swear your life to your art, if that makes sense. \"So I don't want to upset anyone that's reading this - but it's almost like the", "abstract": "In a nondescript apartment complex half a mile from the Cutty Sark, Tinie Tempah conjures up some of the biggest hits in UK hip-hop.", "candidate": "Tinie Tempah's home is a recording studio.", "doc_id": 188, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Tinie's recording studio is considered their second home.", "evidence": "The studio has been Tinie's second home since 2008.", "explanation": "First, the source text does not mention Tinie's last name.

Lives could depend on police forces continuing to get access to the data on devices used by criminals and terrorists, he said. The FBI was talking to both Apple and Google about its fears, said Mr Comey. The conversations with tech firms needed to be had before the day when police forces lost access to those devices, he said. \"I'd hate to have people look at me and say, 'Well how come you can't save this kid?' 'How come you can't do this thing?'\" said Mr Comey in a briefing. His comments came in reaction to a decision by Apple to enable a file encryption system on its iOS 8 software for which it has no keys. This means it would not be able to comply with any official request to help police get at the data on those devices. Google has said it too is planning to enable a similar encryption system by default on the next version of Android. Mr Comey said he was \"very concerned\" about these plans because of what they would allow people to do. \"What concerns me about this is companies marketing something expressly to allow people to place themselves beyond the law,\" he said. \"I am a huge believer in the rule of law, but I am also a believer that no-one in this country is beyond the law,\" he added.

The singer said she was not angry with Gray and claimed \"the system has failed him\", a view echoed by his mother. The 30-year-old started pursuing the star by sending abusive rants and accusations in letters. He progressed to banging on her door and spending nights in her back garden. Gray was eventually charged by police after an incident last October when the singer was awoken by him bursting into her bedroom in the early hours. Allen said she was made to feel like a \"nuisance rather than a victim\" by police, adding that the experience had left her \"a changed person\".

I could see he was really agitated and upset,\" she told the BBC's Newsnight. Alex Gray, from Perth, was charged and found guilty of harassment and burglary and is awaiting sentencing.

{"article": "The claim: Membership of the European Union guarantees rights on equal pay, sexual harassment and maternity leave, and rights for part-time workers. Those rights would be in jeopardy if Britain voted to leave. Reality Check Verdict: The EU has been influential in the development of equality legislation but leaving would not necessarily mean those rights would be lost. The Treaty of Rome included the commitment for member states to ensure \"that men and women should receive equal pay for equal work\". And the rules were strengthened following the 1975 Equal Pay Directive, and subsequent rulings by the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which have set out further what counts as equal work. Similarly, the right of part-time workers to join occupational pension schemes was determined by rulings of the ECJ, which found that excluding them constituted indirect sex discrimination. If Britain leaves the EU those rules could, in principle, be revoked. However, in some cases the UK government has gone further than the rules set by the EU. For example, the 52 weeks of statutory maternity leave in the UK is considerably longer than the 14 weeks guaranteed by EU law. Leave campaigners say there's no reason to suppose that a future British government would undermine women's rights. But Ms Harman believes that many of the people leading the campaign for Brexit - including Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Iain Duncan Smith - cannot be trusted to protect women's rights.

{"article": "The move would also ease the \"growing burden\" on politicians in Cardiff Bay as more power is devolved, the group's Wales director Martin Warren said. Peers serving in the UK cabinet have set the precedent, he added. Parties in the assembly have questioned the idea on the grounds of democracy and accountability. The accountants' organisation said scrutiny of Welsh legislation was suffering due to \"significant workloads for politicians shifting from Westminster to Cardiff Bay\". If it proved difficult to increase the number of AMs from the present 60, a bigger role could be given to the 40 MPs from Wales as their role in Parliament diminished, Mr Warren said. He suggested letting the first minister appoint MPs to the Welsh cabinet, or inviting MPs to serve on assembly committees, in both cases reducing the demands on the time of politicians in Cardiff Bay. Another idea put forward was the creation of a non-political body of professionals who could advise on and scrutinise policy. \"Wales is a small country with limited resources and making best use of those resources within a democratic framework to achieve for Wales must surely be an objective that crosses all political borders,\" said Mr Warren.

Mr Khan is one of Bollywood's biggest stars and has starred in more than 80 Hindi-language films.

{"article": "Five Saudis, reportedly including a prince, were detained at Beirut's airport after two tonnes of pills branded as Captagon were found in cases due to be loaded onto a private jet. It was the largest drug smuggling operation yet uncovered at the airport. Captagon pills, which typically contain amphetamine and caffeine, are consumed widely in the Middle East. The drug has helped fuel the conflict in Syria, generating millions of dollars in revenue for producers inside the country as well as being used by combatants to help them keep fighting. NNA reported that 40 bags of Captagon pills were found by inspectors from the Gendarmerie in cases due to be put on board a jet bound for Hael, in northern Saudi Arabia. It did not identify the Saudi citizens who were detained, but sources told the Associated Press and the AFP news agency that they included a Saudi prince. In April 2014, Lebanese security forces foiled an attempt to smuggle 15 million Captagon pills hidden in shipping containers full of corn from Beirut's seaport, according to AFP. Captagon, originally the trade name for the synthetic stimulant fenetylline, was first produced in the 1960s to treat hyperactivity, narcolepsy and depression. However, it was banned in most countries by the 1980s because of it was too addictive.

{"article": "Every owner of a gadget piloted via a touchscreen has spent time rubbing it with a tissue, a cloth or a sleeve gripped round the heel of the hand to banish those unsightly marks. It's not that human fingers are filthy. Those smears come about thanks to a mix of physiology and good grooming habits, said Steve Block, an electronics industry scientist at Dow Corning, which makes coatings that get applied to touchable screens. \"There's a whole range of things that can contaminate those surfaces,\" he said. \"There are natural oils on the fingers as well as the lotions people put their hands. Then there's cosmetics and the times when you hold your telephone up to your ear and it's sweaty.\" Small wonder then that the sight of those smears is unsettling. Thankfully, there is no reason to fret, as those smears are safe if your touchscreen gadget is kept just for you, said Prof Charles Gerba, a microbiologist at the University of Arizona. \"Touchscreens are a source of a wide range of microbes, but not much of an issue if you do not share it among other people - since, if you are the only one using it, it's only your germs,\" he told the BBC. Sadly, that is not the case when those touchscreens are put to more promiscuous use, such as in a supermarket at the self-checkout, by patients in a doctor's waiting room or in a family that passes the gadget around. Studies by Prof Gerba and colleagues have shown how important an infection vector touchscreens can be when used by lots of people. \"We have traced the spread of MRSA skin infection among teenagers that shared a cell phone,\" he said. \"You will find MRSA on touchscreens on self-checkout screens in grocery stores in the US.\" Touchscreens can be \"reservoirs of opportunistic pathogens\", said Prof Gerba in a small-scale study that uncovered MRSA, E. coli and C. difficile and many others on screens in hospitals and supermarkets. It is worth keeping those surfaces clean, said Prof Gerba, even if the chances of getting ill are pretty low. \"For viruses it can take as little one to make you ill, but this varies a lot depending on the organisms. Some bacteria take 100,000 cells to cause illness, others a few hundred,\" he said. \"It just depends if you come across the right organisms at the right time.\" The study was carried out to test the best way of keeping those screens clean and killing off the bad bugs. The good news is that wipes impregnated with sodium hypochlorite (bleach), did a good job of disinfecting the screens. However, regularly wiping with bleach might not be a solution that domestic owners of very shiny, very expensive gadgets would favour. Thankfully, other fixes are at hand. To begin with, said Mr Block, screen makers are constantly refining the materials and coatings that make gadgets easy to wipe and keep clean. Those transparent coverings are glass, he said, but of a very particular type. Typically, he said, they and the coatings covering them are engineered to the most minute scale. \"They are made of very specialised molecules that are designed for these type of applications,\" said Mr Block. The silicone coatings that are now becoming standard are far more resistant to the secretions and substances that can end up on a touchscreen. Also, said Mr Block, they are tougher and ensure a screen will stay responsive years after it is bought. There are other innovations that might help too. Japanese materials company Toray has come up with a coating that, it claims, repels up to 50% more of the oil and other residues found on fingers. In addition, once applied, the coating dries into millions of tiny wrinkles that help hide smudges to help screens stay sharp. The fourth generation of Gorilla Glass, which is used on many touchscreen gadgets, will include an antibacterial coating that can kill those pesky bugs by themselves. That coating is likely to start being used within the next couple of years. Then there is the work of scientists at Harvard University's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, who turned to a carnivorous plant to develop their screen coating. They found that the walls of the pitcher plant are slippery because they are covered with tiny bumps that trap water. Insects that can easily walk on walls struggle to make any progress on this surface because it repels the oils on their feet. By mimicking this surface and applying an ultra-thin layer of lubricant, the researchers created a surface inimical to bodily substances. The work is still in the lab but is more evidence that those screens are only going to get harder to smear and easier to use. \"Any dirt is a barrier between user experience and a display,\" said Mr Block.", "abstract": "Touchscreen tablets and phones are popular in almost every respect but one - the smears that fingers leave on the screen.", "candidate": "The sight of a smear on the touchscreen of your smartphone, tablet or computer is enough to leave you scratching your head. \"You will find MRSA on touchscreens on self-checkout screens in grocery stores in the US.\" Touchscreens can be \"reservoirs of opportunistic pathogens\", said Prof Ger", "doc_id": 200, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "Touchscreens can be \"reservoirs of opportunistic pathogens\", said Prof Gerba in a small-scale study that uncovered MRSA, E. coli and C. difficile and many others on screens in hospitals and supermarkets.", "explanation": "The summary accurately quotes the Professor and the facts about germs on phones.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

McLaren's Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button were in unexpectedly high 13th and 14th places as others struggled. Like McLaren, Red Bull and Toro Rosso will take penalties for using more than their permitted number of engines and it remains to be seen in which order these will leave the six drivers at the back of the grid. Qualifying gets under way at 13:00 BST, with coverage on the BBC Sport website from 11:30 and on BBC Radio 5 live from 13:00. There seems little doubt about who will be at the front after another imperious performance from Hamilton. The world champion has looked untouchable so far this weekend and seems an almost certain bet for his 11th pole in 12 races this season. Media playback is not supported on this device . After Friday practice, Rosberg admitted his team-mate had the edge and that he needed to work out how to match the Briton's pace through the final two corners at Ascari and Parabolica. The German actually set the fastest time in the final part of the lap, which comprises the two demanding fast corners, but Hamilton edged him this time in the two chicanes and the Lesmo corners and remained tantalisingly out of reach. Instead, Rosberg was surprisingly beaten by his compatriot Vettel, who showed an improvement in form after a difficult Friday as Ferrari chairman Sergio Marchionne was joined by Piero Ferrari - the son of founder Enzo - watching from the Ferrari garage. Whether the red cars can maintain that pace once Mercedes turn up their engines for qualifying remains a different question. Ferrari face stiff opposition from the Mercedes customer teams - Force India, Williams and Lotus for places behind the world champions at the front of the grid. The prospects for two grand former champions, Red Bull and McLaren, are rather grimmer. Both teams have engine partners in Renault and Honda who are failing in their struggle to match Mercedes, falling short in both reliability and performance. Media playback is not supported on this device . And both - as well as fellow Renault customer Toro Rosso, the Red Bull junior team - are taking penalties for changing engine parts. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was using a brand new engine that would add to the 25 grid positions worth of penalties he had already accrued, but that failed in the course of the session, team boss Christian Horner saying the problem was \"terminal\". Earlier, Horner attempted to make a joke of the situation, saying the competition for who can take the most penalties was closer than that at the front of the grid. Renault denied Horner's claim that a development engine might not appear this year. Horner said if it did appear it would be worth only 0.15secs a lap.

{"article": "This pointer takes the form of a nickel signature in the rocks of the crater that is now buried under ocean sediments in the Gulf of Mexico. An international team has just drilled into the 200km-wide depression. It hopes the investigation can help explain why the event 66 million years ago was so catastrophic. Seventy-five percent of all life, not just the dinosaurs, went extinct. The UK-US led team gave an update on its research here at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. The group is currently running all manner of lab tests on the hundreds of metres of core pulled up from under the Gulf in April and May. One tantalising revelation is that the scientists observe a big nickel spike in the sediments immediately above what has become known as Chicxulub Crater. This is an important marker that could lead on to the discovery of asteroid material itself. The presumed 15km-wide space object would have been vaporised in the impact. But some portion of it would have condensed into small spherules in the sky to then rain back down on the bowl. It should be stressed that the nickel is not in itself an identification of asteroid material. To have real confidence, the scientists would prefer to see the element iridium. This is extremely rare on Earth but is frequently associated with meteorites. Iridium is apparent in the geological layers around the globe that mark the dinosaur-killing event at the end of the Cretaceous Period, but to find it in the actual crater would be an exciting observation. It could result in further insights on the nature of the asteroid that smashed into Earth. One theory is that its metals could have made the environment toxic for many lifeforms. Four labs are currently testing for the presence of iridium. Prof Philippe Claeys from the Free University in Brussels says finding the Nickel is a very good sign. \"Nickel behaves chemically in a way that is very similar to iridium; it loves to make strong chemical bonds with iron, just like iridium,\" he told BBC News. \"So we treat nickel as what we call a proxy for an elevated concentration of iridium. If we see high nickel, it's very likely that we're going to have high iridium.\" Chicxulub Crater - The impact that changed life on Earth . The project to drill into Chicxulub Crater was conducted by the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD) as part of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP). The expedition was also supported by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP). Rock was recovered from more than 1,300m below the modern seafloor in the Gulf of Mexico. What has thrilled the team is the quality and abundance of material now in the labs. \"Why this is a jackpot core is because we have an expanded section.

{"article": "But the message may take some time to reach India. The country had a lone shining moment with Girisha Hosanagara Nagarajegowda's silver medal in Men's High Jump F42 class for athletes with an impairment that affects their arms or legs. And deservedly the nation cherished Girisha's feat as medals have generally eluded India's Paralympians. But now questions are being raised at the country's ability to translate the congratulatory tone into awareness of disabled rights. India is not known for being friendly towards the disabled and most public places still lack basic facilities to help them in everyday life.\u00e3\u20ac\u20ac . 'Second-class' citizens . Even before Girisha won his medal, Indian media was abuzz with stories about problems at the Athletes' Village. Several athletes complained that the Paralympics Committee of India had failed to book accommodation for escorts and coaches at the facility. This made the lives of the athletes very tough as they were denied precious time with their coaches. Taking to CNN-IBN, weightlifter Farman Basha said his preparation was severely affected because he could not move freely in the village without his escort. \"I was confident of a medal and now all my training has gone in vain,\" he said. The channel's editor, Rajdeep Sardesai, ran a special show to discuss whether India treats its Paralympians as second-class citizens. Many other channels and newspapers followed suit. It's an irony that the controversy received more coverage than the Games themselves. India may have won just one medal, but the Games were full of inspiring stories. The media seems to have clearly missed a chance to tell these stories to Indians in detail.\u00e3\u20ac\u20ac . Speaking on the CNN-IBN show, Olympic silver medallist Rajyawardhan Singh Rathod said he was not surprised with the treatment of India's Paralympians. He said much needs to be changed to give equal rights to Paralympians and millions of disabled people in India. \"It's an over-all attitude shift that we need to bring about in our country,\" he said. There is another thread to the story that the India media seems to have missed. The Indian contingent at the Paralympics did not have a single female athlete. While officials say this boils down to qualification woes, the problem runs much deeper. Most schools and colleges lack basic sporting facilities for the disabled and the ones which do rarely encourage disabled women to participate.\u00e3\u20ac\u20ac . While stories about the controversy continue to make headlines, nobody can take anything away from Girisha. The athlete certainly fought against the odds to make sure India did not return home from London empty handed. He hails from the south Indian state of Karnataka and belongs to an average middle class family. But his determination to win a medal set him apart from others. His training in Bangalore took place away from the glare of the media and fan recognition. With support from an NGO and government, Girisha quit his bank job six months ago to concentrate on training. Today the result is there for everyone to see. And he hopes that his achievement will transcend the boundaries of sporting achievement and change the attitude of people towards disabled in India.

{"article": "The cameras will be operated by the Canadian Urthecast company, which intends to stream high-resolution video of the planet to web users. Russian cosmonauts completed the attachment in a six-hour spacewalk on Monday. It followed an aborted installation attempt in December. On that occasion, there was a difficulty in getting telemetry through to Moscow mission control. In a statement on Tuesday, Urthecast confirmed that both cameras were passing data to the ground following the latest effort. \"During the installation, we were able to complete all of the intended tests during the spacewalk,\" the statement read. \"At this time, all telemetry received and analysed is within our expected results.\" The cameras were made for Urthecast by the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in Oxfordshire, UK. The high-resolution video unit should provide a resolution on the ground of about 1m per pixel. Large crowds and moving vehicles would be visible on this scale. The second camera will provide static imagery at a medium resolution of 5m per pixel. \"Testing of every part of the camera system will now follow. Once that's completed, we can expect the first imagery to be released publicly,\" said Prof Richard Holdaway, the director of RAL Space. \"We'll be helping Urthecast. We'll be checking the optical alignment and focus, to see that it is everything we expected,\" he told BBC News. Urthecast hopes to build a business around space station imagery. One of the customer sectors for the hi-res video, for example, is likely to be news organisations that want moving pictures of major events, such as war zones and regions of the Earth hit by natural disasters. It is hoping also to generate social media buzz around its imagery products, by enabling people to tag and share pictures through a special web portal. Urthecast is one of a group of Earth observation start-ups currently in the process of launching and commissioning space hardware. Skybox Imaging of San Francisco has already started to showcase video of Earth acquired by its small, free-flying SkySat-1 satellite. And Planet Labs, another San Francisco venture, has a \"flock\" of 28 nano-satellite imagers that are about to be released out of the airlock on the ISS. The station itself is increasingly becoming a platform for Earth observation. This is quite a challenge, however. The movement of the astronauts inside the ISS makes it flex, and there is a constant vibration from onboard equipment. All this requires cameras to have dampers built into their rigs to maintain a steady shot. The US space agency (Nasa) will be launching another two Earth-observing instruments to the station this year.

Fortunately, Mr Krebs was already monitoring the website and saw the plot being planned in real time. He alerted the FBI and local police. \"I am little concerned\", he told the BBC. \"But then there are a lot of things people can do to upset you and get under your skin using a keyboard and few clicks of a mouse. \"But what's the next level?\" The person behind the attempted plot, according to Mr Krebs, set up a bitcoin wallet to accept donations of the digital currency from fellow forum members. He raised about $200 (\u00c2\u00a3131) worth of bitcoins and used it to buy 12 small bags of heroin using the Silk Road online black market. The package duly arrived at Mr Krebs's house, and he handed it over to the police. This is just the latest example of a sustained smear campaign against Mr Krebs orchestrated by hackers and cybercriminals disgruntled at his exposure of their antics.

Mr Krebs says he opened the front door to find a squad of policemen pointing a battery of guns at him. After being hand-cuffed and questioned, he managed to persuade the police they had been hoaxed by hackers. The informant had used a instant message relay service designed for hearing impaired and deaf people to pretend to be Mr Krebs reporting that Russians had broken into his home and shot his wife. The phenomenon, known as swatting, after the special weapons and tactics (Swat) teams called out to handle hostage and other dangerous situations, had begun on the West Coast, the police told Mr Krebs, but had been working its way eastwards. \"This type of individual prank puts peoples' lives at risk, wastes huge amounts of taxpayer dollars, and draws otherwise scarce resources away from real emergencies\", Mr Krebs blogged. \"What's more, there are a lot of folks who will confront armed force with armed force, all with the intention of self-defence.\" Mr Krebs also says his website suffered a major distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.

{"article": "It wants to redress the balance from the university's walls being lined with pictures of \"dead white males\" by adding more women and ethnic minorities. The portraits include broadcasters Dame Esther Rantzen and Reeta Chakrabarti. Oxford's head of equality Trudy Coe said it was \"sending a signal\". This commissioning of portraits is one of the biggest projects by the university to create a more diverse range of people portrayed in its public places - including more women, people from ethnic minorities, gays and lesbians and people with disabilities. The university faced a high-profile controversy last year over whether a statue of Cecil Rhodes should be removed - after claims that the Victorian colonialist's attitudes on race made him an unsuitable figure to be commemorated. The new pictures on the ancient walls will include scientist Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell and author Jeanette Winterson. There will also be some men, including film maker Ken Loach. \"We're not taking anyone down - but the portraits have been almost exclusively men and we're just beginning to redress the balance,\" says Ms Coe, head of the university's equality and diversity unit. \"It will allow students to look up and see people who look like them. It's sending a signal to a wider range of students that they belong here,\" she says. Ms Coe says the new pictures will reflect the modern reality of university life - and the people who have been painted or photographed have been nominated by current staff and students. The people depicted have links with the university - such as being former students or academic staff - with the criteria that they were examples of excellence and widened the range of pictures from the \"narrow and traditional\" and \"challenged stereotypes\". Among the people to be represented will be criminologist and disability rights campaigner, Marie Tidball. \"Symbols are important,\" she said. There are millions of people with a disability in the UK, Ms Tidball said, but they have a \"lack of visibility in public spaces\". The commissioning of a picture of an academic with a disability was a \"very significant\" step towards making sure that all kinds of students could feel at home at the university, she said. \"I really hope that this speaks to kids now doing their GCSEs,\" said Ms Tidball. And she rejected suggestions of an excess of political correctness as \"absolute nonsense\". BBC journalist Reeta Chakrabarti said it was a project which reflected the university's current staff and living alumni. These are people who are \"alive and kicking, a representation of modern day Britain,\" she said. \"You could just continue to portray the same people, but it wouldn't be a reflection of how the university and society have changed,\" she said. \"Different ages, different societies celebrate different values.\" As a student at Oxford, she said \"there weren't many people there who were like me, from my sort of background\". But she had an \"overwhelmingly positive experience\" and \"nothing about Oxford made me feel out of place\". Oxford University has faced questions about whether it is admitting enough poorer students and state-school pupils.

Motor neurone disease (MND) campaigner Gordon Aikman is awarded the British Empire Medal. John Muir, who has campaigned against knife crime following the murder of his son, receives an MBE. And Edinburgh-born broadcaster Nicky Campbell has been given an OBE for services to children. Campbell, a regular on TV and radio for years, has spoken openly about his experience of being adopted and is a patron of the British Association for Adoption and Fostering (BAAF). Dr MacMillan, who wrote a new choral piece which was sung when Pope Benedict XVI conducted mass at Bellahouston Park in Glasgow in 2010, is being knighted for services to music. His compositions are widely played around the world by performers ranging from top international orchestras to local church and community choirs. Dr MacMillan said: \"I am totally delighted to receive this honour. I am especially pleased that the world of music, and contemporary composition in particular, will receive greater focus and recognition as a result.\" The 55-year-old composer, who was born in Kilwinning in North Ayrshire, has previously described the high point of his career as \"writing a piece for the unveiling of a statue of the founder of Celtic FC\". Mr Aikman, 30, from Edinburgh, is being awarded the British Empire Medal after raising \u00c2\u00a3300,000 to raise awareness of MND, which he was diagnosed with last year. The former Scottish Labour spindoctor, who set up his GordonsFightback.com campaign after being diagnosed, said: \"Day in, day out thousands of people across this country are bravely battling this disease. \"I want to share this honour with each and every one of my fellow fighters.\" Aileen Paterson, the creator of Maisie the kitten, is also among those to receive an honour. The author, who penned the much-loved series of books about adventures of a cat from Edinburgh's Morningside, is being awarded with an MBE for services to children's literature. The same honour has been awarded to campaigner John Muir, who led demands for tougher sentences for knife crime after his son Damian was stabbed to death in the centre of Greenock in 2007. From the sporting world, Peter Dawson, the chief executive of The R&A and secretary of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, is recognised with an OBE. Mr Dawson will step down in September after 16 years leading the body which organises the Open Championship. Iain McMillan, who was the director of the CBI in Scotland for almost two decades, is to be knighted for his services to the economy north of the border. The same honour goes to Prof Pete Downes, who has been the principal and vice-chancellor of Dundee University since 2009, in recognition of his work in higher education and life sciences. Prof Downes is one of the UK's most distinguished and cited bioscientists, and identified the role of the drug Lithium in treating manic depression. Dr Lena Wilson, the chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, the national economic development agency, is recognised for her efforts with a CBE. As part of her role, she has travelled to more than 60 countries across the world, promoting Scottish business interests and advising governments on foreign investment and private sector development. Lynne McNicoll, who has raised more than \u00c2\u00a31m to support children with cancer and their families, will be presented with an OBE. Her fundraising activities inspired her to set up the Edinburgh-based charity It's Good 2 Give five years ago, and she has continued to raise funds despite being diagnosed with breast cancer earlier this year. The charity is currently raising funds to build a special centre where youngsters with cancer and their families can go for breaks of up to seven days.

The BBC's Nick Bryant at the UN says such a warning from the organisation is unusually blunt. The US president does not set the budget, but makes recommendations to Congress. It is understood that the UN secretary general has been lobbying Congress members on the importance of international peacekeeping. The US provides 28.5% of the United Nations peacekeeping budget - almost three times as much as the next-highest contributor, China.

{"article": "Odion Ighalo put the hosts in front from close range, only for Antonio to level with a solo effort moments later. Matej Vydra restored the Hornets' lead from the spot after he was brought down by Kelvin Wilson. But Antonio levelled again, heading in Chris Burke's cross to leave new Watford boss Slavisa Jokanovic with four points from his first two games. Media playback is not supported on this device . Watford are now on an unbeaten run of seven games, which has been overseen by three different head coaches, with Oscar Garcia leaving at the end of September and his replacement Billy McKinlay making way for Jokanovic two weeks ago. Meanwhile, Stuart Pearce's Forest have fallen away from the top two to sixth, with their last league victory coming at home to Fulham on 17 September, and they started slowly as Fernando Forestieri and Vydra both forced saves from Karl Darlow. A David Vaughan free-kick that was deflected narrowly wide was Forest's only response before Ighalo had the Hornets in front - and his third goal in his last three games - by poking in Gianni Munari's superb back-flick from Almen Abdi's cross. Media playback is not supported on this device . The lead lasted just two minutes though, as Abdi gave the ball away to Antonio who strode forward and finished from a tight angle, before Michael Mancienne seemed to be fortunate to get just a booking for bringing down Vydra when he was through on goal. Shortly after the break Vydra was brought down by Wilson and the Czech calmly rolled in from 12 yards to restore the lead. And the Hornets looked relatively comfortable afterwards, moving the ball around with confidence, until Burke did well to find space down the right and swung in a hanging cross that Antonio powered in at the back post for his eighth of the season. Vydra's shot straight at Darlow was as close as Watford came to a late winner, and they drop down to second after Derby's win at Blackpool. Watford head coach Slavisa Jokanovic: . \"I think we played very well in the first 60 minutes. The last 30 minutes we lost a bit of tactical order and tried to win the game with hearts and not minds. \"For me [the Mancienne foul] was 100% a sending off. It's the same with the penalty. For me both situations are sendings off.\" Forest assistant manager Steve Wigley: . \"It was a good point. We knew we were coming to a team that was in the best form they've been in this season. \"We knew we would have to play well and resolute is a good word to describe us. We showed a lot of character.

Committee chair David Davies, who voted for Britain to leave the EU, opened with this question: \"May I begin by asking what you think are the potential advantages to Wales of Brexit?\" Mr Cairns, who campaigned for Britain to remain, gave this hesitant reply: \"Well there are certainly lots of challenges. The advantages are that we are almost forced to look elsewhere other than Europe and we need to remember we're not turning our backs on Europe, we're just merely leaving the European Union and nations across Europe will still remain friends and allies. \"The advantages are that we will need to focus our efforts on seeking new international trade opportunities and in developing relationships between Welsh business and Welsh stakeholders with those new markets. There are of course a whole series of other issues and challenges that will remain.\" He did concede there could be short-term \"additional marketing opportunities\" for tourism from the fall in the value of the pound. Mr Cairns said he had been holding some \"stakeholder engagements\" to discuss the impact of Brexit . Questioned about devolution, he said there are no changes planned to the Wales Bill other than those he has previously signalled at committee stage. Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts complained that the Bill was going through Parliament so quickly it was difficult to scrutinise properly. Mr Cairns said every debate had finished with time to spare. Asked about the dropping of the commitment to hold a referendum before Wales gets income tax powers, he told the MPs: \"Tax is an absolutely essential part of devolution policy.\" He added: This is about mature, accountable devolution.\" He said he intended to have a fiscal framework agreed with the Welsh Government before the Wales Bill becomes law. Asked about funding, he said: \"There are no plans to change the Barnett Formula.\" He said the funding floor introduced by the government meant funding per head was set at around 115 % of the English average. On the steel industry, Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock said that there were some concerns about the possible joint venture of ThyssenKrupp and Tata Steel Europe. Mr Cairns said: \"ThyssenKrupp are prepared to invest significant sums of money into a joint venture scheme with the offer of support from the UK government, and that in itself we can take encouragement from because that shows they're prepared to spend money.\" He said taxpayers' money would only be used if there was a viable sustainable future in steelmaking.

{"article": "The performance artist is spending 512 hours interacting with the public at the show, held in three completely empty rooms. Phones, cameras and even watches are banned, as Abramovic takes people by the hand and encourages them to spend time focusing on the bare white walls. \"Take in the silence,\" she whispered to one. \"Just be present.\" After half-an-hour, the gallery was filled with human statues, manoeuvred into position by the Belgrade-born artist and her team of six \"guards\", all clad in black. Participants closed their eyes and rocked on their heels, some assumed meditative positions, while others followed Abramovic around, hoping for a personal interaction. \"I really wanted to connect with her, so I said a little prayer,\" said Sophie, a student sculptor from London. \"Connecting with her presence was really special. She said, 'stay here as long as you like, take deep breaths, be present'. \"It was perfect, really.\" Entry to the exhibition, which lasts for 10 weeks, is free but only 160 people can be admitted at a time. Each can stay as long as they wish, with the gallery imposing a \"one in - one out\" policy. Abramovic herself opened the gallery doors at 10:00 BST - as she will every day - by which point there were already hundreds of acolytes and art lovers queuing in Kensington Gardens. Geraldine, an art professor from Kensington, had arrived at 06:30 BST to be amongst the first to see the performance. \"It was like being at a very beautiful party where nobody talks,\" she told the BBC. \"It may push me into doing some meditation, which is probably very good for me, so it changed my life in a very positive way.\" \"Just to sit and get lost in one's thoughts, I think it's very relaxing,\" said Andrew, a psychiatrist visiting the UK from San Francisco. \"And certainly some people were crying, too, so perhaps it brings up some thoughts that one pushes down from normal life.\" The show is titled 512 Hours, after the amount of time Abramovic will spend in the gallery. It is her first performance work since The Artist is Present, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, where she sat motionless, six days a week, looking directly at whoever sat down in a chair placed opposite her. Both shows lack the startling drama of her earlier performances, including one in which she systematically stabbed her hand with knives. In another, she whipped herself, before cutting a five-point star in her stomach with a razor blade and lying on a cross made of ice. Once, she nearly died after lying in the middle of a burning cross made of petrol-soaked sawdust. On another occasion, she allowed an audience member to hold a loaded gun to her head. Nonetheless, she told the BBC her latest show \"really frightens me\". \"I worry about the British public,\" she said, adding that the public's cynicism might get in the way of creating \"a pure emotional connection\". \"My only chance with the British public is to be vulnerable,\" she told Radio 4's Front Row. \"The audience is someone who completes the work.\" Ahead of the show, the 67-year-old was accused of failing to acknowledge other artists who engage in the \"art of nothing\". Two weeks ago, a group of US art historians curators wrote to the Serpentine, asking it to recognise the influence of Mary Ellen Carroll. a conceptual artist who has been working on a project called \"Nothing\" since 2006, when she went to Argentina with only her passport. But Abramovic dismissed the accusations, telling the BBC: \"There is nothing on the walls of the gallery, no work. But I am working eight hours a day with the energy of the public.\" During the first hour of the first day of her performance, Abramovic seemed to be playing a giant game of cosmic yogic chess, with the public as her pieces, positioned carefully throughout the gallery. There was something eerie about entering a room full of bodies frozen in space but, once guided into position, most of the visitors reported feeling an overwhelming sense of wellbeing. \"I started seeing the sky - the clouds in the sky - in the white of the wall,\" said Chester, a TV producer who had skipped work to attend the opening. \"It was a religious experience. I think you'd have to sum it up as that.\" Abramovic says the performance will evolve over the course of its 10-week run. \"Maybe it's complete silence, maybe we all scream together, maybe we all lie on the floor. \"Everything is there, in possibility.

{"article": "Earlier this week, a councillor in the Scottish Borders said she believed people were being short-changed by the rollout of the service. BT has said it has invested heavily in providing services in areas where it was not commercially viable to do so. It has also pointed out that there are a wide range of factors at play in determining the speeds received. The BBC Scotland news website asked for your experiences of the service in the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway. Iain Rennie emailed: I live in the village of Ednam. Barely 2 miles from Kelso. We get a max of 1.5Mb. It is frustrating in the extreme to see constant TV adverts for high speed broadband when ours is too slow to stream or watch BBC iPlayer etc. As far as I'm aware there is no date or plan to upgrade this area. Byron Raistrick, of Ruthwell, emailed: Since the announcement by the Scottish Executive that the initiative was up and running, I've not seen any evidence of the \u00c2\u00a3126m being distributed fairly and efficiently to the areas that need it most - rural locations. Major cities such as Glasgow and Edinburgh would have been upgraded as a matter of course by BT Openzone to cater for the businesses there and in turn the residential areas would have benefited, yet (they) have been upgraded first with the money. Linda Lonsdale emailed: We pay extra money to get superfast broadband and it is not any faster load of rubbish conned again. Susan Cook emailed: Broadband speed in our village 0.9Mb and sometimes even lower. We have been told by BT that it will be four to six years before we get anything better! And we pay the same as all their other customers. There are people living in the Borders other than in Melrose and Galashiels yet no consideration is given to them. Siobhan Liehne emailed: We live on the Mellerstain Estate near Gordon. We keep reading of ministers complaining that constituents in some Borders areas are \"only getting 2Mbps\". Frankly I would give my eyeteeth for that kind of speed. We get 0.7 Mbps if we are lucky and sometimes it drops out altogether. Then we have to see signs up telling us that towns only a very short distance away are getting superfast. When we ring BT to try and find out when things are going to improve we get someone in India telling us that it must be our computer. If it is, then it's every computer on the estate, no matter how new it may be. Andrew Gray emailed: I live near Chirnside in the Scottish Borders which is enabled for fibre broadband. However only those residents who live within a mile of the cabinet can get anything like the speeds advertised. My house is two and a half miles from the cabinet so the fibre signal does not reach it at all. According to most comparison websites (including BT's) I can receive broadband speeds of up to 40Mb but in practice I get just over 2Mb, if I'm lucky. There should be further scrutiny of how public money has been spent on improving broadband services, particularly in rural areas, to ensure that everyone can benefit in the future. Henry Sinclair emailed: I live in Earlston and have what the major players call \"superfast\" broadband - ie fibre to the cabinet, which is 100m away or just over 200m of copper wire. The actual speeds I get vary between 20 and 70Mbps download and 15 to 20Mbps upload. My grandson who lives no more than 400m from me and 300m from a cabinet can only achieve a max of 6Mbps and pays the same as me. Copper is a 19th century answer to a 21st century question but BT continues to squander taxpayers' money on using it to provide an inadequate or in some cases no service while the solution is staring it in the face. As the internet moves from a consumer model to an interactive one the pathetic download speeds and risible upload speeds will hold us all back and eventually our interconnection system will have to be re-engineered using fibre. Why not do it now rather than throwing billions at a known fatally flawed approach? Brian Telfer emailed: I have had issues since BT started to enable the Hawick exchange well over a year ago. I was getting better speed and reliability before the exchange was enabled for fibre. I am now on fibre at double the price, with continual buffering drops in service and regular visits from engineers who contradict each other - speed can be from 1.52Mb to 20Mb - not the 52 Mbps I am paying for. Uploads are a joke - I now use my phone tethered to the computer to upload anything! Peter Dorward emailed: I read your report with interest particularly the part that referred to over \u00c2\u00a38m being invested in super fast broadband by SBC and that 94% of homes will have it. At the moment why not focus attention on getting something like 'normal' broadband speeds to all households.

The Union Cycliste Internationale said three cyclists were withdrawn due to previous drugs cases, with another three implicated in the doping scandal. Wrestler Viktor Lebedev, who returned a positive doping test at the 2006 Junior World Championships, was also banned. Following a report conducted by Canadian law professor Richard McLaren, which said Russia operated a state-sponsored doping programme from 2011 to 2015, the International Olympic Committee ruled any Russian athlete who has served a doping ban will not be eligible for Rio 2016. So far, more than 110 of the 387-strong Russian team have been banned from the Games, which get under way on 5 August. The final line-up will be announced on 30-31 July, according to the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC). Eleven of Russia's 17-strong cycling squad have been cleared to ride in Brazil. United World Wrestling cleared 16 Russian wrestlers, while all four Russian badminton players have been told by the sport's governing body they can compete. Badminton World Federation's Thomas Lund said the governing body was satisfied the athletes had been tested in and out of competition. \"We have had a rigid drug-testing programme, especially leading up to Rio 2016,\" he added. \"Their samples have been analysed outside of Russia.\" Boxing, golf, gymnastics, handball, taekwondo and weightlifting are still to confirm their eligibility decisions. \"We will tell how many people will go in the next few days,\" said Alexander Zhukov, the head of the ROC.

{"article": "Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) led the international investigation. Security sources have told the BBC that the NCSC believes that a hacking group known as Lazarus launched the attack. The US Computer Emergency Response Team has also warned about Lazarus. The same group is believed to have targeted Sony Pictures in 2014. The Sony hack came as the company planned to release the movie The Interview, a satire about the North Korean leadership starring Seth Rogen. The movie was eventually given a limited release after an initial delay. The same group is also thought to have been behind the theft of money from banks. In May, ransomware called WannaCry swept across the world, locking computers and demanding payment for them to be unlocked. The NHS in the UK was particularly badly hit. Officials in Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) began their own investigation and concluded their assessment in recent weeks. The ransomware did not target Britain or the NHS specifically, and may well have been a money-making scheme that got out of control, particularly since the hackers do not appear to have retrieved any of the ransom money as yet. Although the group is based in North Korea the exact role of the leadership in Pyongyang in ordering the attack is less clear. Private sector cyber-security researchers around the world began picking apart the code to try to understand who was behind the attack soon after. Adrian Nish, who leads the cyber threat intelligence team at BAE Systems, saw overlaps with previous code developed by the Lazarus group. \"It seems to tie back to the same code-base and the same authors,\" Nish says. \"The code-overlaps are significant.\" Private sector cyber security researchers reverse engineered the code but the British assessment by the NCSC - part of the intelligence agency GCHQ - is likely to have been made based on a wider set of sources. America's NSA has also more recently made the link to North Korea but its assessment is not thought to have been based on as deep as an investigation as the UK, partly because the US was not hit as hard by the incident. Officials say they have not seen any significant evidence supporting other possible culprits. North Korean hackers have been linked to money-making attacks in the past - such as the theft of $81m from the central bank of Bangladesh in 2016. This sophisticated attack involved making transfers through the Swift payment system which, in some cases, were then laundered through casinos in the Philippines. \"It was one of the biggest bank heists of all time in physical space or in cyberspace,\" says Nish, who says further activity has been seen in banks in Poland and Mexico. The Lazarus group has also been linked to the use of ransomware - including against a South Korean supermarket chain. Other analysts say they saw signs of North Korea investigating the bitcoin method of payment in recent months. The May 2017 attack was indiscriminate rather than targeted. Its spread was global and may have only been slowed thanks to the work of a British researcher who was able to find a \"kill switch\" to slow it down. The attacks caused huge disruption in the short term but they may have also been a strategic failure for the group behind it. Researchers at Elliptic, a UK-based company which tracks bitcoin payments, say they have seen no withdrawals out of the wallets into which money was paid, although people are still paying in to them. Those behind the attack may not have expected it to have spread as fast as it did. Once they realised that their behaviour was drawing global attention, the risks of moving the money may have been seen as too high given the relatively small amount involved, leaving them with little to show for their work. The revelation of the link to North Korea will raise difficult questions about what can be done to respond or deter such behaviour in the future.", "abstract": "British security officials believe that hackers in North Korea were behind the cyber-attack that crippled parts of the NHS and other organisations around the world last month, the BBC has learned.", "candidate": "North Korea is believed to have been behind the WannaCry ransomware attack in May, the BBC has learned.", "doc_id": 235, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "A North Korean group is believed to have been behind the WannaCry ransomware attack in May, the BBC has learned.", "evidence": "Although the group is based in North Korea the exact role of the leadership in Pyongyang in ordering the attack is less clear.", "explanation": "The summary indicates that the attackers are from North Korea, not that North Korea, the State, is the attacker.", "instruction": "Replace the information about North Korea being the attacker with the information about a North Korean group being the attacker.", "instruction_list": ["Replace the information about North Korea being the attacker with the information about a North Korean group being the attacker."]}}
{"article": "He was a multi-millionaire property developer with a wife and family going through a \"mid-life crisis\", she was the \u00a310,000-a-month escort he pinned his hopes for a future on. Former burlesque dancer and stripper Georgina Symonds enjoyed the trappings of being with millionaire Peter Morgan - spa days, exclusive luxury hotel stays, a BMW and a Range Rover. He housed her rent-free in a bungalow in the vast grounds of the castle in Llanmartin, Newport, south Wales, he owned and gave her cash-in-hand to pay the bills, as well as paying for her to have full-body liposuction. Morgan, from a prominent and wealthy Welsh farming family, was infatuated with and hoped to build a future with the dancer he called \"George\", the woman for whom he left his wife of 23 years, the mother of his two children. Miss Symonds' childhood best friend Nadine Tilley said: \"She told me she was really happy and things were going well. She said he treated her well.\" But when Miss Symonds' on/off boyfriend Peter Deem and her father both killed themselves within six months of one another, she turned to drink and drugs to cope. She started to blame Morgan, of Llanellen, near Abergavenny, for Mr Deem's suicide in November 2015, and for a meeting she then had with social services about the welfare of her daughter. Her mother and friends watched her verbally abuse him repeatedly, and said he \"just stood there and took it\" whilst remaining \"calm\". Mother Deborah Symonds told the murder trial at Newport Crown Court: \"She was trying to do things to upset him, to make him feel hurt but I don't think anything could make him hurt. \"That's what she said she was doing it for. She wanted him to have a bit of pain.\" Morgan planted a listening device in her home which he nicknamed \"Isobel\" - which was essentially a SIM card and microphone hidden in an adaptor he could ring in to listen through. He said this was to monitor her drug use rather than spy on her, but he phoned the device 514 times during 10 weeks. Then, in January 2016, he overheard the mother-of-one on the phone talking about blackmailing him to \"fleece him\" for everything he had. Morgan, who had been seeing Miss Symonds for three years, knew she had sexually explicit photos and films of them having sex in his wife's home and the marital bed, and that she had previously successfully blackmailed at least three former clients. That night Morgan made a precise murder \"to do\" list on his phone, strangling Miss Symonds the next day in her home with orange baling twine. Before leaving the scene of the murder he fed Miss Symonds' three Jack Russells, did the washing up and put out the rubbish. He wrapped her body up in polythene sheeting and duct tape and put it in his car boot, before hiding it in a workshop at his estranged wife's farm in Beech Hill Farm in Usk, south Wales. Morgan then went about his daily business, including visiting the bank and going to the building site he was developing at that time, saying he just wanted to get back to his routine. He told police it was not until he got a phone call saying Miss Symonds had not picked up her daughter from school that he remembered he had strangled her to death. Later that night he confessed to killing her and, while refusing legal help, gave the police a detailed account of the events leading to her death. Despite this he pleaded not guilty to murder, pleading diminished responsibility due to having Asperger syndrome. The unusual defence was that the syndrome - a collection of personality traits - meant Mr Morgan had diminished responsibility and had committed manslaughter rather than murder. It was a complex argument built around the premise that Morgan saw things in such a black and white way he felt forced into a course of action someone else would not normally take. Giving evidence in the trial consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Phillip Joseph said Asperger syndrome could provide \"an explanation\" for the killing. He said: \"If he suffers from the condition it is at the very least a significant contributing factor.\" Asperger syndrome is a form of autism, the difference being the person suffering from it does not have learning difficulties. They may have a very binary way of thinking, have difficulties communicating and crave routine and predictability rather than change. Someone with Asperger syndrome may also have very particular, obsessive interests, which they are keen to tell others about. Director of the Autism Research Centre Professor Simon Baron-Cohen told the court although there is not much research on Asperger syndrome and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in murder, there was growing awareness of how it could lead to the crime in a small number of cases. He added: \"There are an increasing number of cases that the courts are hearing about. When the alleged involved find themselves trapped in a certain way they might resort just through logic alone to the idea that they have to get rid of the person who is causing the threat. This is just an impression there is insufficient research to draw solid conclusions yet.\" Morgan himself, who had built two successful businesses and was married with children, was said to initially find it inconceivable he could have Asperger syndrome. But Prof Baron-Cohen, who diagnosed Morgan just before the trial, said it explained a lot of the millionaire's actions both during and before the murder. He pointed to the businessman's preference to fix up machines rather than spend time with people, and his obsession with machinery and military history. Morgan kept excavators, cranes, tanks, an old American fire engine and motorbikes at his home, where he displayed his collection of guns such as an Uzi submachine gun, an AK-47 and Mossberg sawn-off shotgun on the walls. \"His accounts of his social relationships are not that", "abstract": "As a millionaire is found guilty of murdering his escort, how did he claim Asperger syndrome made him do it?", "candidate": "As Peter Morgan is found guilty of murdering Georgina Symonds, the BBC News website looks at how the relationship between the couple turned sour.", "doc_id": 236, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "A looks at how the relationship between Peter Morgan and murder victim Georgina Symonds couple turned sour.", "evidence": "Former burlesque dancer and stripper Georgina Symonds enjoyed the trappings of being with millionaire Peter Morgan - spa days, exclusive luxury hotel stays, a BMW and a Range Rover.", "explanation": "it makes up a guilty verdict, and the source of the article", "instruction": "Remove the information about the verdict and the source of the article from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about the verdict and the source of the article from the summary."]}}

{"article": "The victim who cannot be named to protect her safety, was abused for more than 10 years, bearing two children. Violence against women is endemic in Afghanistan and victims of sexual abuse are often themselves jailed for \"moral crimes\". I met the victim, who is in her early twenties, for the first time last year after the trial against her father was suspended with the judge asking for DNA evidence. She was pregnant as a result of the abuse and held her four-year-old on her lap. \"This is my daughter and my father's daughter,\" she said. \"She is the result of my father raping me. We are both mother and daughter and sisters at the same time.\" As sunlight streamed through the drawn curtains of the impoverished home she shares with her mother, she told me the story she had presented in court for the first time last summer. According to the victim, the abuse began when her father returned from Iran after eight years abroad. She was 12 years old. \"I was expecting that my father will love me the way my uncles love their children because I was thirsty for a dad's love during all the years I was deprived of him,\" she says. \"But when I found myself in my father's arms it was too much.\" She recalls how he touched her intimately, making her feel uncomfortable. \"I went to my grandmother and complained but she blamed me. I was told that every father caresses his children.\" Then one night her father raped her: \"I was scared badly, I was shocked and lay in the corner of the room and didn't know what to do.\" When she became pregnant, the father moved the family to another province. The baby was born but he took it away - she never saw it again. The abuse lasted more than 10 years, during which the daughter went through multiple pregnancies and abortions. She says that her father used a variety of drugs which she later learned were attempts at contraception. Eventually another child was born. \"When I became pregnant again, I kept the baby and didn't abort my child,\" she says: \"I kept it to have proof for my claims against my father - my child was my only evidence.\" With the support of her mother, she finally managed to end the abuse. The final attack, she told me, happened in July last year, one day before Eid. \"Me and my mother had told the whole story to the mullah, neighbourhood elders and the district police and they told us to inform them if I was attacked again.\" That night the father sent his wife out of the home before assaulting his daughter again. He was arrested as the mother returned with police and elders as witnesses. Even though he was put on trial, the daughter's ordeal was far from over. As the father denied all charges, claiming his daughter had extramarital relationships with other men, the victim herself was challenged in court. \"The judge questioned me, asking why I didn't kill the baby that was in my belly?\" she told me. \"I answered that if I killed the child I could be accused of aborting it because the father was another person. I kept my child to prove I have a case against my father.\" The court then suspended the trial, asking for DNA samples of the accused, the victim and her daughter. What followed was a campaign to seek justice. The victim had taken the unusual step of appearing on Afghan television to tell her story. Women's rights activists began organising support. There are virtually no facilities for genetic forensic testing in Afghanistan, making foreign assistance imperative. The woman's supporters lobbied embassies and non-governmental organisations for help, But it still took almost a year before a DNA test could be arranged, by which time the victim had given birth to another child. Finally a committee of officials from the attorney general's office and the interior ministry took on the task. \"They took blood and saliva samples from the father, the woman and her children and transferred them to the US via Bagram airbase,\" says Ruhulla, the victim's lawyer. \"If we didn't have this test result, my client would have been punished based on the codes and laws of this country,\" she says. The samples were processed by the US firm \"Ideal Innovations\", specialists in forensic testing who are also active in Afghanistan, providing fingerprint and biometric identification technology. They did the test for free. When the results were finally returned they showed that the accused had indeed fathered his daughter's children. The judge sentenced him to death. The case is not yet closed, though. The father is appealing against the sentence, protesting his innocence. DNA evidence is very rare in Afghan court cases, making this trial highly unusual. The victim, meanwhile, told me that even if her abuser is executed, she remains fearful. \"I'm so worried about the future of my children,\" she says \"What will I tell them when they are older and ask me about their father?\"", "abstract": "An Afghan court has passed a landmark judgement, using DNA evidence to convict a man for the multiple rape of his daughter.", "candidate": "A court in Afghanistan has sentenced a man to death for repeatedly raping his daughter.", "doc_id": 247, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "The judge sentenced him to death", "explanation": "All of the details in the summary are present in the source text: That it was in Afghanistan (\"There are virtually no facilities for genetic forensic testing in Afghanistan, making foreign assistance imperative.\"); that he was sentenced to death (\" The judge sentenced him to death \"); and that he repeatedly raped his daughter (\"The abuse lasted more than 10 years, during which the daughter went through multiple pregnancies and abortions.  \")", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

{"article": "Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead announced the move earlier this month. Almost 30 organisations have signed an open letter seeking an urgent meeting with him to discuss their concerns. Mr Lochhead said the changes would not affect research. Under EU rules, GM crops must be formally authorised before they can be cultivated. An amendment came into force earlier this year, allowing member states and devolved administrations to restrict or ban the cultivation of genetically modified organisms within their territory. Mr Lochhead announced he would use the amendment to request Scotland be excluded from European consents for the cultivation of GM crops. The letter - whose signatories include the National Farmers' Union, the Royal Society of Edinburgh, the Roslin Institute and the European Academies Science Advisory Council - said they were \"extremely concerned\" about the \"negative impact\" a ban could have. It claimed the decision was \"political and not based on any informed scientific assessment of risk\". The scientists and academics said outlawing the cultivation of GM crops \"risks constraining Scotland's contribution to research and leaving Scotland without access to agricultural innovations which are making farming more sustainable elsewhere in the world.\" The letter cited examples where \"a GM method has a contribution to make\". It highlighted ongoing research on things which \"might benefit Scotland's farmers, consumers and environment\" including potatoes that can reduce fungicide use and omega-3 enriched oilseeds that may offer a more sustainable source of feed for salmon farming. Responding to the letter, Mr Lochhead said he respected the views of those in the scientific community and would be happy to meet them. He said he would \"reassure them that these changes will not affect research as it is currently carried out in Scotland, where the contained use of GM plants is permitted for scientific purposes, such as in laboratories or sealed glasshouse facilities\".

Gallai'r rhain gynnwys safleoedd yng Nghymru ym Mae Caerdydd, Casnewydd a Bae Colwyn, ac yn Lloegr, oddi ar arfordir Cumbria a Bae Bridgwater. Dywed Ysgrifennydd Cymru, Alun Cairns fod y Llywodraeth yn edrych ymlaen at astudio adroddiad Charles Hendry \"a phenderfynu sut y gall lagwnau gyfrannu at anghenion ynni Cymru a gweddill y DU.\" Mae Llywodraeth Cymru wedi croesawu'r adroddiad.

{"article": "The poster with the phrase #prayforjosh appeared in Holywood by the A2 within the last week. It is part of a social media campaign supporting 13-year-old Joshua Martin, from Donaghadee, County Down. Life took a dramatic turn for the teenager when he was diagnosed with cancer on Christmas Eve. He was due to have an operation on his appendix at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. However, doctors instead discovered and removed a large primary cancer and five smaller growths. The news shocked Josh's family, but since his diagnosis they have received lots of support from people all over the world. It began as a hashtag on Facebook and Instagram by Bangor Elim Church, where Josh's father is on the pastoral staff, and has since gone viral. The church's senior pastor, Gary Beattie, said he was amazed by how many people have supported Josh and his family so far. \"We were in total shock when he was diagnosed, and really the family just wanted support from people and to ask people to pray for Josh,\" Gary said. \"It certainly isn't a campaign as such, we just put the hashtag on our Facebook posts to get some of our congregation thinking about him. We had no idea that it would take off. \"We would use social media quite a lot because we have quite a young congregation, and we've been posting updates about Josh from his family. \"The update was shared 948 times and it's been seen by over 79,000 people. It's absolutely phenomenal. \"We thought there had been a mistake, but you can look at the views and where they've come from, and there are people all over the world supporting him, which is great.\" But how did a social media hashtag lead to the appearance of the massive billboard? Gary said that last week a mystery donor paid for the sign and it was erected at Holywood playing fields. \"We do not know where it came from, we didn't put it there, but it means a lot to have such support,\" Gary said. There has also been a huge outpouring of support on Twitter for the Bangor Grammar pupil, with his classmates using the now-global hashtag for their friend.

{"article": "The rate hit 5.1% in the three months to November - its lowest rate since the three months to October 2005, according to the Office for National Statistics. The number of people out of work fell by 99,000 to 1.68 million in the three-month period. Average weekly earnings, including bonuses, were up 2%, the slowest increase since February. The 2% growth in wages was below the 2.1% growth forecast in a Reuters survey. Excluding bonuses, average weekly earnings growth slowed to 1.9% in the three months, the ONS said. The figures show that the employment rate hit 74% - the highest since comparable records began in 1971. The figures come a day after Bank of England governor Mark Carney ruled out an early rise in interest rates because of the turmoil in the global economy and weaker UK growth. A sustained improvement in wage growth was one of the factors he said would help the Bank to gauge when to raise rates. He has previously said he would like to see earnings growth at above 3% a year before rates are increased. Capital Economics economist Ruth Miller said the figures confirmed an interest rate hike \"is still some way off\". \"There still seems very little inflationary pressure coming from the labour market,\" she added. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, the forecasting body of accountancy firm EY, said the jobless rate was now below the pre-crisis average of 5.2%, yet it had not triggered excessive pay growth: . \"The latest pay numbers will exacerbate concerns raised in recent MPC meetings that very low inflation may be pushing down pay settlements, threatening a negative feedback between wages and prices. \"That the first post-crisis rate hike may be pushed back into 2017 is looking an ever-more realistic possibility.\" The latest ONS figures show that almost 23 million people are now in a full-time job, 436,000 more than a year earlier, while 8.4 million are working part-time, up by 152,000. The number of workers in part-time jobs wanting a full-time post is 1.2 million, down by 21,000 in the latest three months. Economic inactivity, counting people on long-term sick leave, looking after a relative or who have given up looking for work, fell by 93,000 to just under nine million, the lowest since the spring of 2014. The inactivity rate for women reached a record low of 27%. The figures for unemployment in the three months to the end of November are based on the Labour Force Survey, in which the ONS speaks to 40,000 households once a quarter, making it the country's biggest household survey. The ONS is 95% confident that the figure of a 5.1% rate of unemployment is correct to plus or minus 0.2 percentage points - in other words, it's between 4.9% and 5.3%.", "abstract": "The UK unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest rate in more than a decade but wage growth has slowed.", "candidate": "The UK unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level in more than a decade, official figures show.", "doc_id": 254, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "The employment rate has risen to its highest level since records began, official figures show.", "evidence": "The figures show that the employment rate hit 74% - the highest since comparable records began in 1971.", "explanation": "If the unemployment rate is low, then by default the employment rate is high- the source text does reference the UK and official figures.

Local police and the British embassy in Hanoi have been informed about his disappearance. Friend and fellow botanist Ian Sinclair, who has been liaising with the search parties, said they had been hampered by horrendous weather. \"The snow is continuing to melt, but there is a massive amount of snow damage to the forest such as collapsed trees,\" he said. \"The weather has been horrendous, with snow down to Sapa.

{"article": "Bottas, on whom Williams have a contractual hold, is Ferrari's number one option should they decide not to retain Kimi Raikkonen alongside Sebastian Vettel. Sources close to the deal say Ferrari and Williams have discussed Bottas's transfer but have no agreement yet. Williams view Button as a leading candidate should Bottas leave. Should the 2009 world champion join Williams in 2016, it would bring his career full circle. Media playback is not supported on this device . He made his F1 debut for Williams in 2000 before moving on to Benetton/Renault, BAR - which became Honda and then Brawn - and finally McLaren in a career in which he has won 15 grands prix. McLaren have not yet decided who they will pick to drive alongside Fernando Alonso in 2016. The team have a contractual option to retain Button, which means that the 2009 world champion cannot join another team unless McLaren decide not to keep him - or fail to decide until after whatever date is set in the contract as the team's deadline to do so. Their other options are their Danish reserve driver Kevin Magnussen, who raced for McLaren alongside Button in 2014, and the Belgian rising star Stoffel Vandoorne, who is leading the GP2 championship. McLaren have contracts with both men. Williams said they could not comment on driver contracts and Button said he had not yet considered his future. \"I've had a lot of questions thrown at me about what I am doing next year but I have not thought about anything, seriously,\" the 35-year-old said. \"I just have to get my head down and concentrate on improving the car and then in a couple of months we will sit down and talk about next year.\" Media playback is not supported on this device . Bottas, on whom Williams have an option for the next two seasons, said he \"did not know\" whether he would be at Williams next season. \"Nothing is confirmed,\" the Finn said. \"We have to wait and see. As a driver, you want to know as soon as possible but sometimes you have to wait.\" Although Ferrari have pursued various options, sources close to the team say they have decided to put off a decision on Raikkonen's future until later in the summer. Ferrari president Sergio Marchionne said last month that Raikkonen's \"future is in his own hands\" amid concerns at the team that he is not performing well enough compared to team-mate Sebastian Vettel. These come on the back of his poor season in 2014 during which he was comprehensively out-performed by former team-mate Alonso. Ferrari technical director James Allison said this week in an interview with an Italian magazine that Raikkonen was as fast as Vettel but that his results were being affected by the fact he was making more mistakes. Raikkonen said: \"I don't know any more than I knew at the start of the year. For me, the whole thing hasn't changed for months. If I knew I would easily say. Unfortunately I don't know. \"Somehow I end up every year in the same position, and it makes no difference if I have a contract or not. There is no contract, but there is an option now. \"I have made it very clear to the team what I would like to happen, and it is to be here next year.\" If Bottas leaves and Button stays at McLaren, Williams may still look to McLaren's driver pool for a partner for Felipe Massa, on whom they have an option and is expected to stay.

{"article": "Members of the NASUWT, meeting in Bournemouth, criticised a loosening of the rules on who schools can employ to teach children. The government says the changes allow schools to hire talented people and the vast majority of teachers will continue to have the recognised qualification. But the union says it is about saving money. One delegate told the conference children were being taught \"on the cheap\". Last year the government relaxed the rules in England on employing teachers for academies. The semi-independent state schools are now allowed to employ teachers who have not qualified as teachers, bringing them in to line with the situation in free schools and private schools. In other state-funded schools, people employed as teachers have to have passed the relevant qualification - known as Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). At the time, the government said the change would allow schools to bring in talented professionals such as scientists, musicians and university professors, plus experienced teachers and heads from overseas and the independent sector. Schools are also allowed to employ people called \"instructors\" who have particular - usually vocational - skills but do not have QTS, and the rules governing when they can be hired were relaxed last September. The NASUWT says the changes mean less-qualified people are being put in charge of classes - and are being paid less than teachers. It has published a survey of its members which found six out of ten of those who replied said unqualified staff were being used in their schools and that most said unqualified staff were teaching lessons. It asked for views from 2,300 of its members online earlier this month. Chris Keates, general secretary of the union, said: \"The extent of the secretary of state's decision to remove the entitlement of children and young people to be taught by a qualified teacher can now be seen. \"Parents and the public should be deeply concerned at the results of this survey. Now when a parent sends their child to school they have no idea who is teaching them. \"If any suggestion was made that unqualified doctors were let loose on patients there would be public outrage.\" Head teachers' leader Russell Hobby described the changes as \"limited\" and said he did not think heads would be looking to employ unqualified staff. The leader of the National Association of Head Teachers said: \"The vast majority of head teachers will seek out good teachers with QTS, as long as that remains a strong qualification.\" On the conference floor, union member Victor Aguera said: \"This government has turned back the clock to the 1850s and is returning to a 'teacher monitor system'. \"Children are being taught on the cheap. It's part of the privatisation of education.\" A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: \"It is simply not true to claim that this is about depressing costs. This is about raising standards. \"Independent schools and free schools can already hire brilliant people who do not have Qualified Teacher Status. \"We have extended this flexibility to all academies so more schools can hire great linguists, computer scientists, engineers and other specialists who have not worked in state schools before. \"We expect the vast majority of teachers will continue to have QTS. This additional flexibility will help schools improve faster, and give head teachers the freedom to hire the person best suited to their school.\" The NASUWT passed a conference motion to work with others to \"ensure that all those working in schools have appropriate qualifications\".

The trio all appeared at Belfast Crown Court. The charges arose from incidents in 2013. The court hearing was told that on 9 October, 2013, a car driven by Gavin Hughes was stopped in north Belfast, and when the vehicle was stopped a black plastic bag was located on the passenger seat. The bag contained five compact cubes of cocaine which amounted to 1.27 kilos of the Class A drug. When Gavin Hughes was searched, another amount of cocaine was found in the pockets of his jeans, and he was taken into custody. The following day, officers travelled to an address in the Ligoniel area of the city, which at the time was being rented by Gavin Hughes. When they arrived, police found Gavin's two brothers Gareth and Joseph at the property. Both the property and a vehicle parked outside the house were searched, and further packages of cocaine were seized, alongside items and equipment associated with mixing drugs. Also located during the search were 21 ecstasy tablets. The court heard it was the Crown's case that the rented property was being used to mix the cocaine and prepare it for sale. The total amount of cocaine seized on 9 and 10 October 2013 amounted to 3.25 kilos. The Hughes brothers subsequently pleaded guilty to a number of drugs offences, while Gerard Hughes also admitted two further offences - namely possession of cannabis with intent to supply, and possession of amphetamine on 6 August, 2013. These offences were linked to the seizure of drugs in a car park in east Belfast.

{"article": "Next was found to have used a tax avoidance scheme called a rate-booster. The court ruled Next diverted UK profits to foreign subsidiaries to claim tax relief on overseas profits. Such schemes are a way in which firms avoid corporation tax on foreign profits that are then paid back to the UK parent firm. Under rules designed to prevent double taxation of company profits, firms were able to claim credit for tax paid on money they made overseas. But some companies were able to exploit the rules through the creation of artificial arrangements involving what HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) referred to as \"complex circular movements of money between companies in the same group, so they can claim there has been double taxation\". Known as rate-booster schemes, this enabled companies to avoid corporation tax by diverting profits made in the UK to foreign subsidiaries. The foreign subsidiary then paid tax on those profits - often at a lower rate of corporation tax - before the profits were paid back to the UK parent company. Finally, the UK parent company received credits from HMRC for the tax already paid by its subsidiary. As a result, companies were able to claim far more tax had been paid on their overseas profits than was actually the case. Legal changes in 2005 and 2009 mean rate-booster schemes are no longer possible or attractive, HMRC added. The Next case is the second to reach court, following a 2013 ruling against P&O Ferries, although the firm appealed against the decision and an appeal judgement is outstanding. HMRC said about \u00a3130m in tax was at stake across 20 rate-booster cases, which were awaiting the P&O and Next decisions. About 70 rate-boosters have already been conceded by companies that wanted to avoid going to court. This has brought in more than \u00a3500m in tax, it added. HMRC's director general of business tax, Jim Harra, said: \"This case shows how HMRC takes effective action against big businesses that try to avoid paying tax through convoluted, artificial avoidance schemes. HMRC expects all businesses to steer well clear of such schemes.\" In a statement, Next said it had paid the tax owed to HMRC \"some years ago\" and that this had been fully accounted for at the time. The retailer described the dispute between itself and HMRC as \"a technical debate around complex legislation\" which had now been superseded. It added that current UK law generally allowed companies to \"repatriate their profits without a tax charge\".", "abstract": "High Street retailer Next has been hit with a \u00a322.4m tax bill after a court found it diverted profits made in the UK offshore to avoid paying tax.", "candidate": "High Street retailer Next has been ordered by the Court of Appeal to pay more than \u00a3100m in back taxes.", "doc_id": 276, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Retailer Next has been found by a court to have engaged in tax avoidance in a scheme called a rate-booster.", "evidence": "Next was found to have used a tax avoidance scheme called a rate-booster.", "explanation": "The original summary is not correct because the source text does not name Next as a \"High Street retailer.\" It is also incorrect because the source text does not say that the Court of Appeal has ordered to pay more than 100m in back taxes.", "instruction": "Remove the information about High Street from the summary.

{"article": "BBC Radio 4's File on 4 programme discovered 22 profiles belonging to men convicted of child sex offences, which included grooming a child on Facebook and attempting to meet her for sex. Six of the accounts remained live three weeks after the BBC reported them. Facebook's UK policy director Simon Milner said the company was effective in dealing with the issue. He said he appreciated the BBC bringing the pages to light but said Facebook worked proactively to search out behaviour that should not be happening on the site. According to the platform's own rules, convicted sex offenders are not allowed to use the social media network. Among the profiles uncovered was one belonging to Bruce Cordwell, 20, who groomed 15-year-old Kayleigh Haywood through Facebook and Whatsapp just days before she was raped and murdered by another man, Stephen Beadman, in November 2015. \"It's absolutely vile,\" said Stephanie Haywood, Kayleigh's mother, when she was shown Cordwell's page. Kayleigh, from Measham, Leicestershire, was contacted by 28-year-old Luke Harlow on Facebook in 2015 and the pair exchanged more than 2,600 messages during a two-week period. After Harlow convinced art enthusiast Kayleigh he was her boyfriend, she agreed to stay over at his flat in Ibstock. The following night, his neighbour Stephen Beadman came round to the flat and later raped and murdered the teenager before dumping her body in a hedgerow. Beadman was jailed for 35 years for murder, rape and false imprisonment, and Harlow received a 12-year sentence for meeting a child following sexual grooming, sexual activity with a child and false imprisonment. But while detectives were investigating the case, they discovered Cordwell, then 19, had also been sexually grooming Kayleigh. In February, he was jailed for three years and seven months after pleading guilty to attempting to arrange the commission of a child sex offence. Stephanie, a mother-of-eight, said convicted child sex offenders who remained on social media posed a huge risk. \"There is a risk they could do what they've done again, or worse,\" she said. \"I say, 'Once a groomer always a groomer.' \"Once they've been inside for whatever they've done, I think they should remove it. I think it's horrible.\" By comparing police mug shots and media coverage of child sex abuse cases and cross-referencing them with the details on Facebook, File on 4 tracked down accounts belonging to 22 convicted offenders. Facebook has a rule that forbids convicted sex offenders from using its site and has a portal for people to report pages belonging to offenders. The portal requires people to supply a link to the offender's page and provide evidence of their offending, which could be a link to a media report of the court case. Facebook then checks on the offenders with the police before removing them from the site. When the BBC reported the 22 pages it had found, most were removed within 48 hours - but six remained live three weeks after the BBC reported them. Facebook said it was waiting for confirmation from police that the final six were convicted offenders before it could remove the pages. In response to File on 4's findings Facebook's UK policy director Simon Milner, said: \"We appreciate you did that, we appreciate it when anybody reports to us things that are happening on Facebook that shouldn't be. \"Our teams that focus on this work with the relevant local police force to get authorisation from them and it works.\" Mr Milner said Facebook worked proactively to search out behaviour that should not be happening on the site. He added: \"We've found in terms of our working relationship with law enforcement in this country and elsewhere they think we are amongst the most effective companies in dealing with this issue and we actually do have the right kind of arrangements in place.\" Meanwhile, exclusive figures obtained by File on 4 through Freedom of Information requests revealed the most popular social media platforms had been linked to more than 7,000 reports of child sex crimes over the past three years. Figures from 22 police forces revealed 7,162 child sex offences had been recorded between 2014-15 and 2016-17, with a 44% increase recorded over the three-year period. The offences included rape, sexual activity with a child and child sexual grooming involving children as young as three years old.

{"article": "Two men have already been arrested and questioned on suspicion of theft and fraud offences. A man in his 30s is still being detained in Wexford. Another man arrested in Limerick on Monday has been released without charge. Brexit Secretary David Davis said on Tuesday the news that one of the London attackers - Rachid Redouane - moved there from Dublin should not alter existing travel arrangements between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. The two men were arrested by Garda detectives and questioned about the use of documentation and Irish social security numbers in Redouane's name, Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 reported. An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Irish police) detectives are working to identify the activities, addresses and associates of Rachid Redouane during his time in Ireland. However, Garda\u00ed have stressed their investigation is focused on theft and fraud offences rather than terror. The investigation into Redouane's time in Ireland has intensified over the past 48 hours. Thirty-year-old Redouane, who claimed to be Moroccan-Libyan, was based in the the east London suburb of Barking. He was also known by the name Rachid Elkhdar. Details of his identity and background began to emerge when an Irish identity card was found on his body after he was shot dead by police. It is understood he arrived in the UK in 2006 and applied for asylum but that the application was rejected in 2009. It is reported that he lived in Harrow in north-west London. The details of when he arrived in the Republic of Ireland or how long he stayed there are still not clear. However, it is believed he obtained a European Union residence permit which allowed him to travel to the UK whilst he lived in Ireland. He married a British woman, 38-year-old Charisse Ann O'Leary, in Dublin in 2012. It is understood that it was this marriage that allowed Redouane to obtain a 4 EU FAM card given to spouses of European Union citizens. The couple lived in Rathmines on Dublin's south-side. Reports suggest Redouane worked as a pastry chef. He left Ireland after the marriage and settled in the UK before returning to Ireland in 2015. Redouane is understood to have had a 17-month-old daughter with Ms O'Leary, although the couple were estranged. According to reports, he visited his child before carrying out the London attack along with Khuram Shazad Butt and Youssef Zaghba. An imam who runs a mosque in Galway that came under attack on Monday, has called on both the British and Irish governments to take action in the wake of the recent attacks. Imam Ibrahim Noonan said \"extremists and radical minds\" had been visiting and lecturing in certain mosques in Dublin, Cork and Galway. \"I do know that the Garda are working hard and doing something, but maybe they are restricted due to human rights law,\" he told Good Morning Ulster. The imam said his mosque had been attacked during the hour of prayer on Monday, as some people blamed he entire Muslim community in the wake of extremist attacks. \"Every time attacks happen, all Muslim communities around Ireland, Northern Ireland, and the rest of the UK become tense,\" he said. \"Ninety-nine, point nine, nine, nine percent don't associate themselves with these terrorist extremists - they are peace loving people.\"", "abstract": "Irish police say further arrests are expected as part of an investigation into the background of one of the London attackers who lived in the Republic of Ireland.", "candidate": "Police in the Republic of Ireland are continuing to investigate the movements of one of the London attackers.", "doc_id": 278, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "Police in the Republic of Ireland are continuing to investigate the activities, addresses and associates of one of the London attackers.", "evidence": "An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Irish police) detectives are working to identify the activities, addresses and associates of Rachid Redouane during his time in Ireland.", "explanation": "The police are not investigating the person's current movements but rather his activities, addresses and associates in the past.", "instruction": "Replace the information about movements with the information about activities, addresses and associates.", "instruction_list": ["Replace the information about movements with the information about activities, addresses and associates."]}}

{"article": "It is a tiny signal seen in the way the waters at the ends of the 35km-long lake rise and fall. When combined with the direct tug from the gravity of the Moon and Sun, the loch surface goes up and down by just 1.5mm. The study is reported in the Journal of Geophysical Research. \"If you were on a boat in the middle of the loch, you certainly wouldn't notice it,\" said Philip Woodworth from the UK National Oceanography Centre (NOC), Liverpool, \"but a tide like this has never been observed in a western European lake before.\" Prof Woodworth, David Pugh and Machiel Bos say their precision measurement technique could be used in other lakes around the world to understand better how the Earth's crust deforms as a result of ocean movements - rather like a carpenter will use a spirit level to gauge how a length of wood deviates from the horizontal. \"I have described Loch Ness as the largest spirit level in the world,\" David Pugh, who is a visiting professor at NOC, told BBC News. None of us can feel it, but Britain rises and falls by centimetres every 12 hours and 25 minutes as a great bulge of ocean water washes around the country. The pencil-shaped Loch Ness is the largest UK lake by volume, and although inland, is close enough to the North Sea to be influenced by this loading effect. The team placed pressure sensors a few metres under the lake surface at six locations, from Fort Augustus in the far southwest to Aldourie in the far northeast. They then monitored the change in the height of the overlying water during the course of 201 days. What the scientists saw was a clear spike in the data twice a day - the result of the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun. But they could also tease out a second signal stemming from the way water rises and falls as a result of the tilting of the land. And, in fact, the latter effect sits on top of the first and is responsible for most of the amplitude change. The team says the measurement was made to an accuracy of just 0.1 mm over the loch's 35 km length. \"We had to extract the tidal signal and get rid of all the noise. This involved very high precision,\" explained David Pugh. \"For example, the loch surface itself goes up and down every day by four centimetres just due to the pump storage scheme for hydroelectric generation, and we have to pull out a very small signal within that. \"The holy grail would be to learn from the effects of the tides something about the Earth's crust. So the more precise we can get, the more we may learn about the crust.\" Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter .", "abstract": "Scientists have measured the way Loch Ness tilts back and forth as the whole of Scotland bends with the passing of the tides.", "candidate": "Scientists have measured the \"spirit level\" of Loch Ness for the first time.", "doc_id": 281, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "\"I have described Loch Ness as the largest spirit level in the world,\" David Pugh, who is a visiting professor at NOC, told BBC News.", "explanation": "The summary correctly reflects what the scientists have studied about Loch Ness.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

England's second tier, the Championship, spent \u00a342.4m on agents, an increase of 62%. The Football Association figures cover from February 2016 to January 2017. They come two years after the last full-year results (2014-15). Premier League teams spent a record \u00a31.38bn on transfers in the 2016-17 season - a 43% increase on transfer spending from the 2014-15 season. In both League One and League Two the total spending on agents and intermediaries decreased from the 2014-15 figures. League One sides spent \u00a33,098,508, down from \u00a33,167,964, while League Two teams spent \u00a3821,450, down from \u00a31,007,920. Liverpool led the Premier League in agents' fees when the last full-year results were published for the period 1 October 2014 to 30 September 2015, but the Reds' spending has decreased from \u00a314.3m to \u00a313.8 for the 2016-17 period. Manchester City now top the Premier League list with \u00a326,3m, up from \u00a312.4m, followed by Chelsea, who have also more than doubled their spending on agents' fees, up from \u00a312m to \u00a325.1m. Manchester United (\u00a319m) and Arsenal (\u00a310.2m) complete the top five, while Tottenham's outlay has risen from \u00a36m to \u00a37.2m. Yet despite being considered part of the Premier League's 'big six' clubs, Spurs trail behind West Ham (\u00a39.5m) and Bournemouth (\u00a37.4m) in agents' fees paid for 2016-17. Former England, West Ham and QPR winger Trevor Sinclair . I was very fortunate. I met a good agent quite early on in my career after some bad experiences. He took care of negotiations, which is standard, made sure I was pitching myself at the right amount of money to be earning weekly, monthly, annually. On top of that he helped me with financial advice, he helped me with marketing, exit strategies when I finished football, and also just day-to-day things. He was always preaching to do your best and try to look after yourself. The influence that agents have got now in the game is unbelievable. You look at some of the biggest clubs in the UK and Europe, and there are certain super agents who, for me, have too much power. In relation to deals, I think the money should be capped in some way. If you're doing a deal for a player moving for \u00a31m, why would there be another \u00a31m going missing to agents' fees? It's unacceptable, for me, that kind of money going out of the game, when that could be easily used for grassroots football. Jonathan Barnett of the Stellar Group . Agents have a bad reputation because nobody really understands what an agent does and that includes, probably, the FA. It's not deserved. More MPs have committed illegal acts than agents. I think it's unjust, a very unjust one. People get confused when they hear of an agent. They think it's somebody that does transfers, runs around from one club to another trying to sell players. They are more traders and brokers. There are very few of those agents and very few that really matter. However, what we are as an agency and what other reputable companies are, are people who look after players. We don't look after clubs. We don't look after anybody else, we look after the player. And by that, we make sure their life is properly run, any problems are taken care of and their life is made very easy so that all they can do is concentrate on playing football. We get paid for what we're worth. If we do a good job for our player then we get paid. If we do a bad job, we don't. There are plenty of agents who don't earn a living. You've got to be good at what you do and then you get paid rightly. Stoke City chairman Peter Coates . Football clubs, especially top clubs, are getting more and more income, so what happens? Players get bigger and bigger wages, and agents therefore get bigger and bigger fees. It's a product of the marketplace we're in, so I'm not surprised. I wish it were less, but we're in a marketplace that is highly competitive. We've never been able to get any traction and get an agreement to say we'll all dock pay more than X, whether it's 5%, 10% or whatever the figure could be. There seems a reluctance to go down that route. There's no other way we could perhaps rein in what agents get. There are good agents, less good agents and they can earn huge amounts of money. That sometimes can attract the wrong sort of person because the prize is so high. It's one of those facts of life. We wish it was different, but we seem incapable of controlling it. All clubs do their best, obviously we don't want to pay any more than we have to. But it's a tough market.

{"article": "That question is even more pertinent as Labour and Plaid Cymru talk about what they can and cannot agree on. Much of the so called \"economic\" debate has been about its cost - whether we can afford \u00a31bn, and whether the cheaper Blue Route would be a better option . That is a very different question from whether the Welsh economy would be stronger with it, and weaker without. There is little disagreement that the M4 between Cardiff West services and Magor, east of Newport, is regularly congested. And that slows down the A48M and the A470. There's also little disagreement that the M4 is busiest around Newport, partly because of the unusually large number of junctions which encourages local people use the motorway as a route between the various suburbs of the city. To really understand the problems we need to look at where employment in south east Wales has grown up over the last twenty years. Much of it has been developed on new sites along the motorway. It was part of the old Welsh Development Agency's policy in the late 1980s and early 90s to build big business parks, easily accessible by car. Imperial Park, Celtic Springs, Cleppa Park and Cardiff Gate are all examples of that. Many thousands of commuters travel between the Severn Bridge and at least as far west as Swansea to work for companies on those parks. These developments, and the work they offer, have also been a magnet to people living in the Gwent and Rhymney valleys who may have found it a challenge getting work closer to home. Significantly, the Welsh Government's document arguing for the Black Route clearly shows that the highest concentration of traffic is not at Brynglas but at Tredegar Park, where the main road from the Gwent valleys, the M4, the A48 and a host of industrial parks all meet. The cheaper Blue Route would take westbound traffic off the M4 east of Newport but it is hard to see how it would affect the many thousands who travel south towards the motorway. The big question in terms of easing congestion is how much the Metro integrated road-and-rail transport network will change commuters' patterns. It partly depends on whether the full Metro plans are implemented, how well and how quickly. Importantly, the proposed network does include a station at Cleppa Park - the centre of the family of business parks to the west of Newport - and other stops that may tempt people out of their cars. There is also a station planned for the Royal Gwent Hospital. If we had a public transport system that carried people from where they tend to live to where the work is - and where they want to go for shopping and hospital visits - then would we need a whole new motorway? The economic argument for the M4 Black Route centres on time and money lost due to congestion, the poor image that gives of Wales as a modern place to do businesses, and the theory that concentrations of economic activity tend to multiply more quickly than if businesses are more isolated. Wales' economic weakness centres around having too high a proportion of low-skilled low-value jobs, not enough headquarters, and not enough innovation . Perhaps the biggest question is not about the price of an upgrade of the M4, but what Wales will get from it. It's not really about \u00a31bn or \u00a3380m - it's about what we get from that. How much would either route answer the really big challenges of the Welsh economy? Would Wales become home to more research and development, for instance, with speedier travel along the M4? And would that be the magic factor for encouraging new or growing tech firms to be headquartered here? That's what Wales really needs.", "abstract": "So would the Welsh economy be weaker without the M4 Black Route - or for that matter without any M4 upgrade?", "candidate": "How do we ease congestion on the M4 around Newport?

It will sell not only lenses and frames around the world but will also be stocking its own optician's shops as well, such as Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters in the US and Australia, both currently owned by Luxottica. One long-standing independent UK wholesaler, who asked to remain anonymous, says the merged firm would be so powerful it would probably squeeze out some competitors. \"If those two companies merged there would be a branded frame supplier offering you high-end branded frames, and also offering UK opticians a lens and glazing deal, to suit, so they will control almost everything [they offer] to both independent retailers in the High Street and even the chains,\" he argues. In his view this would amount, almost, to a stranglehold on the supply of high-end glasses, with some rivals giving up. \"I imagine it would knock out quite a few glazing houses in the UK, and it would probably knock out other fashion frame houses,\" he adds. Unless you know about the eyewear business, or take an interest in investing in big European companies (they both have stock market listings) the names of the two big firms will probably have passed you by. But if you have been inside an optician's shop you will certainly have heard of the brands they own and make. For instance, the leading varifocal lens brand, Varilux, is made by Essilor. Just a year ago, in presenting its 2015 financial results to investors, Essilor boasted that it was \"an undisputed leader with only 25% market share\" of the combined world market for prescription lenses, sunglasses lenses and lenses for reading glasses. When it comes to just the prescription lenses, it has a 41% share of the world market. For its part, Luxottica owns several of its own brand names such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, and it also makes, under licence, spectacle frames which carry high-fashion names such as Armani, Burberry, Bulgari, Chanel, Prada, Ralph Lauren and Versace. In 2015 the Italian firm made almost 10% of the 954 million frames that were sold worldwide that year, and claims that about half a billion of its frames are currently perched on people's noses. The overall industry internationally is in fact quite fragmented with hundreds of other smaller manufacturers and related businesses such as glazing laboratories. Market research firm GFK describes the optical industry as \"a complex and extremely competitive market-space\". Even so, with the two firms having a combined turnover of more than 15bn euros (\u00c2\u00a312.8bn), of which 3.5bn euros were in Europe, on the grounds of size alone the proposed merger easily meets the requirements of the European Commission for a formal review. These are: . An inquiry would see if the merged firm threatened to be too dominant, thus reducing competition and leading to higher prices for the customers. A Luxottica spokesman told the BBC that the firm was confident that any scrutiny would not hinder the deal. \"The transaction is subject to mandatory submission to a number of anti-monopoly authorities including the European one, as is customary in transactions of this size and nature,\" he said. \"We are confident that the transaction does not raise anti-monopoly issues and will fully co-operate with the anti-monopoly authorities to obtain the required clearance,\" he added. The EU itself says it currently has no comment to make and it has not yet been formally notified of the merger deal under the requirements of its own rules. But the leading chain of opticians, Specsavers, views the impending deal with caution. \"Mergers are a continuing trend in optics, but this is a significant development which will result in huge supply chain and retail implications for the industry and consumers worldwide,\" the firm says. \"It is unlikely that the impact of the merger will be felt by consumers straight away but we will watch with great interest how the new organisation will arrange itself.\" If you have ever bought a pair of spectacles with anything other than the most basic frame and lenses, you may have gulped at the price, possibly coming to several hundred pounds. Of course, not all spectacles are expensive and not all of the sale price goes to the manufacturers. Opticians and the wholesalers that supply them are businesses that seek to make a profit. They also need to cover the costs of staff, equipment, shop and office space, stock and all that advertising. But for the manufacturers such as Essilor and Luxottica, it is a stonkingly profitable business. On worldwide sales of 6.7bn euros in 2015, Essilor made operating profits of 1.2bn euros. For the same year, Luxottica sold goods worth 8.8bn euros and made operating profits of 1.4bn euros.

{"article": "US researchers say the slow-is-more-accurate rule generally applies. In a series of calculations, they looked at the physics behind releasing a projectile with the human arm. Their equations suggest a slow underarm throw is the best strategy for getting a piece of paper into a nearby bin. Lead researcher Madhusudhan Venkadesan, assistant professor of mechanical engineering and materials science at Yale University, said faster throws tend to be less accurate. This is because the ball travels in a nearly straight line, so any errors in the angle at which the object is released tend to be amplified. In slow and curved flight paths, small errors in the angle of release have little effect, he said. \"What we find is that almost the slowest arc is often the most accurate,\" said Dr Venkadesan. \"We've compared these calculations to published data of people throwing into wastebaskets; we've compared it to a study in dart throwing.\" In sports such as basketball or darts, the strategy depends on conditions and the trade-off needed between speed and accuracy. For example, experienced darts players throw overarm at about 5.5 metres per second, optimally releasing the dart 17 to 37 degrees before the arm becomes vertical. On the cricket pitch, fielders are more likely to strike the wicket with a fast underarm throw. And in basketball, the underhand free throw, nicknamed \"the granny throw\", has a marginal advantage over overhand, despite almost disappearing from the game. Accurate throwing is uniquely human - a skill relied upon by our ancient ancestors for hunting with spears or stone tools. The researchers say monkeys also throw things, but they are really bad at it. The study is published in the journal, Royal Society Open Science.

The research group primarily blamed the fall on the US federal budget cuts that came into force at the start of this month.

Sale of such long-lasting factory products rose by 5.7% in February, the biggest increase in five months. Yet the Commerce Department also said that sales of new US homes fell in February. Sale of new residential properties fell to a seasonally adjusted 411,000 in February, 4.6% lower than the 431,000 sold in January, which had been a five-year high. The government cuts - called the \"sequester\" cuts - came into force earlier this month. They were due to the federal government running out of funds before a new budget was finally agreed by the US Senate on 20 March. \"This month's retreat was driven primarily by a sharp decline in expectations, although consumers were also more pessimistic in their assessment of current conditions,\" said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's economic indicators. \"The recent sequester has created uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, and as a result consumers are less confident.\"", "abstract": "US consumer confidence fell sharply this month, a closely-watched report has suggested.", "candidate": "US consumer confidence has fallen to its lowest level in more than three years, according to a survey.", "doc_id": 458, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "US consumer confidence fell by 8.3 points in March, according to a survey.", "evidence": "The Conference Board's index of consumer attitudes fell by 8.3 points to 59.7 in March.", "explanation": "The source text does not say that the consumer confidence level is at its lowest point in more than three years.", "instruction": "Replace the information about three years with the information about 8.3 points.", "instruction_list": ["Replace the information about three years with the information about 8.3 points."]}}

{"article": "Researchers said measuring DNA sections in cancer cells gave an \"accurate indicator\" of disease progression. Shorter DNA structures can leave chromosome ends exposed, accelerating cancer progression and drug resistance. The team believe the study could help doctors in choosing the most effective treatment for individual patients. Researchers from the university's School of Medicine said the tests can be used to predict the outcomes of patients with two different types of blood cancer - the bone marrow cancer myeloma and pre-leukaemia myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The latter is a bone marrow disorder often leading to life-threatening bone marrow failure and even acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Results from two studies, which were funded by the charities Bloodwise and Cancer Research UK, have been published in the British Journal of Haematology. The researchers analysed samples from 134 myeloma patients, 80 MDS patients and 95 AML patients as part of the study. Prof Duncan Baird, who led the research, said: \"Our research provides strong evidence that shortening of telomeres [the DNA sections] plays a vital role in the progression of these blood cancers and that a significant number of patients should be receiving different levels of treatment. \"The next step is to assess telomere length in larger studies to establish how it can be integrated into existing assessments that predict patient outcome.\"", "abstract": "A new test that could hold the key to predicting blood cancer patients' survival has been developed by Cardiff University.", "candidate": "Scientists at Dundee University have developed a new blood cancer test.", "doc_id": 462, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "University scientists have developed a new blood cancer treatment test.", "evidence": "\"Our research provides strong evidence that shortening of telomeres [the DNA sections] plays a vital role in the progression of these blood cancers and that a significant number of patients should be receiving different levels of treatment. \"", "explanation": "The summary gives a name of the university not mentioned in the source text and it does not specify that the test is regarding treatment for cancer.", "instruction": "Remove the information about The university name Dundee from the summary.

{"article": "The minimum prison term has risen from 20 to 40 years. It will apply for all abductions, including those that last only a few hours or days, so-called \"express kidnappings\". The maximum prison sentence will rise from 50 to 140 years for those who kill their victims. Kidnappings committed by a public security official, such as a member of the police or military, will be punished with up to 100 years in prison. Kidnappers will also have to pay heavy fines. In reality, few people ever receive sentences longer than 60 years for federal crimes, but kidnapping is considered in a separate category. The number of kidnappings reported to the police has risen dramatically in Mexico in recent years. In 2007, 438 kidnappings were reported, but the number had risen to almost 1,700 last year. And the government estimates the number of kidnappings reported to the police could be fewer than 2% of the total. If that is the case, the real number of abductions could be about 105,000 per year. Analysts say accurate figures are hard to come by, as many abductions only last for hours or a few days until the victims empty their bank accounts at gunpoint or pay a ransom. Most are never reported to the authorities for fear of reprisals from the criminal gang which carried out the kidnapping. In January this year the Mexican government launched a nationwide effort to fight kidnapping. A federal prosecutor, Renato Sales, was named to head an anti-kidnapping committee that would co-ordinate efforts to fight abductions in the 10 Mexican states (out of 31) where 74% of all kidnappings take place. \"Mexico needs to deal quickly and efficiently with the humanitarian emergency that this crime entails,\" said Mr Sales at the time.", "abstract": "Mexico has published new sentencing guidelines that will double prison sentences for kidnapping.", "candidate": "Mexico's Congress has approved tough new sentences for kidnappings.", "doc_id": 476, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "The Mexican government has enacted tough new sentences for kidnappings.", "evidence": "In January this year the Mexican government launched a nationwide effort to fight kidnapping.", "explanation": "The summary includes the term \"congress\" which is not supported by the source text.", "instruction": "Replace the information about Mexico's Congress with the information about Mexico's government.", "instruction_list": ["Replace the information about Mexico's Congress with the information about Mexico's government."]}}

Gay sex is illegal in Singapore. Government leaders, as well as national organisations representing mosques and churches, have in recent weeks called on both religious and gay rights groups to act with restraint.

Some chose to go online instead to protest at the event. About 4,000 people so far have taken part in a virtual rally called FamFestSG. Its Facebook page carries a quote from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong that defines the term family as \"one man one woman marrying, having children\".

The PM wrote to council leader Ian Hudspeth last month calling it \"counter-productive\" and urging the authority to \"move cautiously in setting out its budget plans\". In his response, Mr Hudspeth said the council's grants from government had fallen and that it had already made back-office savings.

The project will be managed by Spanish telecommunications firm Telefonica, which will sell any unused capacity on the cable to other customers. The cable will help the tech giants move data more quickly and cheaply between their global data centres. Tech companies typically have to pay telecommunications firms to use their cables, which can be costly. And the large amounts of data moving across those lines can make them slower. The project, called MAREA, will be the highest-capacity sub-sea cable across the Atlantic, with an expected capacity of some 160 terabits per second of data, the companies said.

{"article": "The study, by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), added that households actually grew richer during the financial crisis. But it said that the reason for the growth between 2006-12 was the increase in pension values over the period. And the slow rate of growth in overall wealth suggested that young people would lag behind earlier generations. Dave Innes, a research economist at the IFS and an author of the report said: \"Despite the financial crisis, household wealth on average increased in real terms over the late 2000s, driven by increases in private pension entitlements.\" Households aged between 45-54 saw the biggest increases in their pension wealth which rose on average by \u00c2\u00a338,000 over the period. Mr Innes added: \"Even with these increases in average wealth, working-age households are at risk of being less wealthy at each age than those born a decade earlier.\" The report added that the range of experiences among the study group was vast - for example, a quarter of households aged 45-54 saw wealth fall by more than \u00c2\u00a369,000, while a quarter say their wealth increased by more than \u00c2\u00a3138,000. The study also looked at people's attitude towards saving and pensions. 30% of individuals reported saving for an unexpected expense, 23% reported saving for holidays or leisure, 15% for planned expenses, 10% for other people and only 10% to provide a retirement income. Among households aged 25-34, nearly one-quarter (24%) did not expect to receive any income from the state pension in retirement. However, one third expected it would be their largest source of income after retirement. Despite new legislation that automatically enrols workers into workplace pension schemes, nearly half (44%) did not expect to receive any income from a private pension. Rowena Crawford, a Senior Research Economist at the IFS and another author of the report, said: \"It is striking how many individuals do not expect private pensions to have a role in financing their retirement, let alone be their main source of income.\" \"It will be interesting to see how these attitudes change as auto enrolment into workplace pensions is rolled out.\"", "abstract": "Young people are on track to be poorer than their parents at every stage of their lives, according to a new report.", "candidate": "Working-age households are at risk of being less wealthy at each age than those born a decade earlier, a report says.", "doc_id": 1000, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "Mr Innes added: \"Even with these increases in average wealth, working-age households are at risk of being less wealthy at each age than those born a decade earlier.\"", "explanation": "the quote is pulled directly from the source text", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}
{"article": "The reconstruction of the event 66 million years ago was made possible by drilling into the remnant bowl and analysing its rocks. These show how the space impactor made the hard surface of the planet slosh back and forth like a fluid. At one stage, a mountain higher than Everest was thrown up before collapsing back into a smaller range of peaks. \"And this all happens on the scale of minutes, which is quite amazing,\" Prof Joanna Morgan from Imperial College London, UK, told BBC News. The researchers report their account in this week's edition of Science Magazine. Their study confirms a very dynamic, very energetic model for crater formation, and will go a long way to explaining the resulting cataclysmic environmental changes. The debris thrown into the atmosphere likely saw the skies darken and the global climate cool for months, perhaps even years, driving many creatures into extinction, not just the dinosaurs. The team spent April to May this year drilling a core through the so-called Chicxulub Crater, now buried under ocean sediments off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Chicxulub Crater - The impact that changed life on Earth . The researchers targeted a particular zone in the 200km-wide bowl known as the \"peak ring\", which - if earlier ideas were correct - should have contained the rocks that moved the greatest distance in the impact. These would have been dense granites lifted from almost 10km down. And that is precisely what the team found. \"Once we got through the impact melt on top, we recovered pink granite. It was so obvious to the eye - like what you would expect to see in a kitchen countertop,\" recalled Prof Sean Gulick from the University of Texas at Austin, US. But these were not normal granites, of course. They were deformed and fractured at every scale - visibly in the hand and even down at the level of the rock's individual mineral crystals. Evidence of enormous stress, of having experienced colossal pressures. The analysis of the core materials now fits an astonishing narrative. This describes the roughly 15km-wide stony asteroid instantly punching a cavity in the Earth's surface some 30km deep and 80-100km across. Unstable, and under the pull of gravity, the sides of this depression promptly started to collapse inwards. At the same time, the centre of the bowl rebounded, briefly lifting rock higher than the Himalayas, before also falling down to cover the inward-rushing sides of the initial hole. \"If this deep-rebound model is correct (it's called the dynamic collapse model), then our peak ring rocks should be the rocks that have travelled farthest in the impact - first, outwards by kilometres, then up in the air by over 10km, and back down and outwards by another, say, 10km. So their total travel path is something like 30km, and they do that in under 10 minutes,\" Prof Gulick told the BBC's Science in Action programme. Imagine a sugar cube dropped into a cup of tea. The drink's liquid first gets out of the way of the cube, moves back in and up, before finally slopping down. When the asteroid struck the Earth, the rocks it hit also behaved like a fluid. \"These rocks must have lost their strength and cohesion, and very dramatically had their friction reduced,\" said Prof Morgan. \"So, yes, temporarily, they behave like a fluid. It's the only way you can make a crater like this.\" One of the important outcomes of the research is that it provides a useful template also to understand the surfaces of other planets. All the terrestrial worlds and even Earth's Moon are scarred with craters just like Chicxulub. And knowing how rocks can move vertically and horizontally in an impact will assist scientists as they attempt to interpret similar crustal features seen elsewhere in the Solar System. The project to drill into Chicxulub Crater was conducted by the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD) as part of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP). The expedition was also supported by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP).

{"article": "Critics of BT say it has not invested enough in Openreach and want it sold. Ofcom's chief executive, Sharon White, is currently reviewing the company's provision of superfast broadband. She said one option was \"the structural separation\" of Openreach from BT. Ms White explained this was among four possible options being explored. They are: . BT is responsible for connecting almost all households to the network regardless of their service provider, as well as improvements to and maintenance of the network. Ms White said the UK was doing fairly well in rolling out superfast broadband compared with other major European economies which suggests a split is not a foregone conclusion. But she said it was unacceptable that 2.5 million homes did not have access to minimal broadband speeds of 10 megabits per second. The UK government has promised that internet providers will be legally obliged to provide this speed to everyone who wants it by 2020. Ofcom completed the first phase of its digital communications review in the summer and is expected to report its recommendations next year. Ms White, a high-flying Treasury civil servant before she arrived at Ofcom, is used to making these kind of decisions, though not under quite the same spotlight. When I interviewed her she told me that Ofcom was still examining all options - but suggested that she was minded to act rather than let things carry on as before: . \" I think there will be change,\" she tells me. \"We're looking at a number of options, but I think it is very unlikely we will conclude that the status quo which has worked over the last 10 years is where we are likely to be over the next decade.\" Now, it is still far from certain that Ofcom's Sharon White will recommend that Openreach is split off - and the digital minister Ed Vaizey has already indicated that the government is sceptical about such radical action. But BT knows that it is now under the microscope of a regulator determined to prove that it is the consumer's friend. Read Rory's blog in full . Previously Openreach's chief executive Joe Garner has defended their record saying they were installing broadband throughout the country at a \"tremendous\" rate. BT has always maintained splitting off the Openreach division would be a \"mistake\", saying only a company the size of BT can ensure future delivery.

{"article": "Inciting people to harass others online, known as virtual mobbing, could also result in court action, under new Crown Prosecution Service guidance. The director of public prosecutions said it means the CPS would prosecute just as if offences occurred offline. But she stressed this did not mean prosecutors could \"stifle free speech\". The new guidance aims to help police identify online crimes more easily. It also highlights those who post people's personal information, such as bank details - known as doxxing. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said: \"The internet's not an anonymous place where people can post without any consequences. People should think about their own conduct. \"If you are grossly abusive to people, if you are bullying or harassing people online, then we will prosecute in the same way as if you did it offline.\" However, Ms Saunders said context will be an important factor in decisions - for example \"if you're offensive, the legislation would say you have to be grossly offensive, and that's quite a high test\". One woman, who wished to remain anonymous, said she and her daughter, who has Down's Syndrome, had suffered such severe online abuse over the last six years that they had to move house three times. The abuse started, she said, when a friend wrote a book about trolls - anonymously but mentioning her by name. \"The trolls photoshopped images of myself and my daughter on to pornography and posted it on Facebook. They have said I'm a paedophile and called her hateful names like mongoloid; they even set up a website in her name.\" The woman believes the trolls kept getting hold of her details using official forms she submitted when complaining at the use of images of her daughter. \"Even after we moved, they have called us at three of four in the morning threatening to petrol-bomb our house if we will not give up the name of the author. \"It's been horrific - this trolling is not free speech; it's hate speech,\" she said. She added that one of the men stood outside the family home and followed her daughter to school, taking pictures. The incidents are now being investigated by police. Kevin Healey told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he had been abused online for five years over his autism campaign work. He said: \"Not even one troll has been prosecuted or jailed, even though I have made complaints to Twitter and the police. \"It's been a nightmare; it's been horrific - it doesn't go away. It's with you 24 hours and seven days a week, there's no escape from it\". Mr Healey said he doesn't think the changes will make any difference and wants changes to legislation in the UK - and abroad. \"With the laws in the UK, if someone is trolling you from outside the UK - and my last batch of trolls were from the US - the police said we can't do anything,\" he added. The CPS says it will use \"considerable caution\" before charging those posting \"grossly offensive\" material. The changes come after a report found that one in four teenagers is abused online over their sexual orientation, race, religion, gender or disability. The CPS also said underage \"sexting\" between consenting children in a relationship should not be prosecuted, but cases which involve \"exploitation, grooming or bullying\" may lead to legal action. Ms Saunders told the BBC: \"If they are children, they are the same age, there's no suggestion or any coercion or bad motives, then we would not expect that case to be prosecuted. It shows you how careful you have to be about the context of it,\" she said. Asked about whether guidelines on misogynistic hate crimes would be introduced, Ms Saunders said: \"We probably need to think about it.\" A new law on revenge porn - someone uploading explicit images or film of a former partner to humiliate or embarrass them - has led to the prosecution of 206 people across England and Wales since its introduction in April 2015.

{"article": "The increase in would-be buyers was at its lowest point in almost a year during February, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said. Better mortgage deals have helped absorb some of the \"pent-up demand\", the trade body added. But prices are still likely to continue rising, according to Rics. Separately, figures from mortgage lenders show that the government's recently launched Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme seems to have reduced the size of the average deposit required of first-time buyers. The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said that in January, the average first-time deposit had fallen to 18%, from 20% in December. However, the number of loans to first-time buyers, and to those moving from a home they already own, fell back because of the normal seasonal lull in the market at this time of year. The number of mortgages granted to home buyers in January was 16% down from December, but was still 30% higher than in January last year, reflecting the upsurge in sales in the past 12 months. This lull in activity may continue according to Simon Rubinsohn, Rics' chief economist. \"The growth in buyer numbers that we've seen for some months started to slow down in February, as the surge in interest sparked towards the end of last summer began to level off,\" he said. \"While this certainly doesn't mean an end to the increasing activity we've been seeing recently, it does suggest that the pent up demand generated throughout the downturn is gradually exhausting itself.\" One other reason for the slowdown could have been last month's bad weather, especially the floods, making people less likely to view properties, Mr Rubinsohn added. But there are still too few properties coming on to the market, Rics said, which means prices are likely to keep going up. The cost of a home in the UK continued to rise during February, albeit at a slightly slower pace than in previous month, the organisation said. It said 45% more chartered surveyors saw prices rise rather than fall in February. According to its surveys, the cost of a home has now risen across the country for 11 consecutive months. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), released in February, the average price of a UK has now hit \u00c2\u00a3250,000 for the first time. The ONS said house prices rose by 5.5% last year. However, other reports carry much lower estimates.

The EU provides $1,028 (\u00c2\u00a3700) for each Amisom soldier each month; their respective governments then deduct around $200 for administrative costs meaning the soldiers are supposed to take home about $800. This deployment allowance is much more than the meagre salaries the soldiers receive from their governments. The funds are only released to Amisom by the EU once the accounts from the previous payment are signed off. The BBC understands there have been delays over the last two tranches - and last year's June-November payment has only just arrived.

Ugandan military chief General Katumba Wamala said he unable to describe the extent of his frustration over the late payments.

{"article": "Saints had the better of a scrappy first-half, after Jonny Lomax crossed on the back of penalty goals apiece for both sides. Leeds pulled clear when Adam Cuthbertson added to Ryan Hall's score. Danny Richardson's try kept Saints hopes alive but Leeds held on and are now three points clear of third-placed Hull FC in the Super League table. The defeat leaves Saints a point behind Wakefield, who are fourth with four Super 8s games to play. Leeds cannot catch Castleford Tigers at the top, but are in the box seat for the second home semi-final come the top four play-offs. Headingley's impending redevelopment meant this game was to be the last for the 86-year-old roofed terrace, and it added an emotional tinge to a match that held huge significance to the race for Old Trafford. Unfortunately the pre-match festivities failed to transfer to the field, as neither side found their rhythm in a game high on drama but lacking in quality. Saints' best moment of the first half produced the game's first try when Lomax latched on to Zeb Taia's pass after James Roby put the back-rower into space. The hosts were equally disjointed but gave the crowd some cheer when a smart move to the left was finished off by Ryan Hall on his 300th club appearance. Cuthbertson bashed his way across on the back of Leeds pressure but it was never comfortable until the hooter, particularly when the lively Richardson came off the bench to step his way across the stripe with five minutes to go.

{"article": "Scientists say the new species is a member of the group that gave rise to crocodiles and dinosaurs. The reptile lived at a time when the Earth was recovering from a mass extinction that wiped out most animals. The discovery may shed light on how the group of animals evolved and spread. About 252 million years ago, a mass extinction devastated life on land and in the oceans. Some 90% of species disappeared. At the time, the Earth was very different from today, with continents grouped into the supercontinent, Pangaea. Researchers led by Eudald Mujal of Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Spain, examined fossilised footprints from about 247 to 248 million years ago found in the Pyrenees mountains in Catalonia. They found most tracks were made by the ancestors of crocodiles and dinosaurs, a group known as archosauromorphs. Most footprints were small, about half a metre in length, although a few were longer than three metres. Among them was a new footprint that is thought to be a new species of reptile, Prorotodactylus mesaxonichnus. The makers of the footprints could belong to the Euparkeria, a group of dinosaur relatives known from the same time period in Poland, Russia, China and South Africa. Co-researcher Josep Fortuny of the Institut Catal\u00e0 de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont said the footprints suggest the animals, measuring around half a metre, used all four limbs to walk and often also left marks with their tails. \"Some footprints point to the possibility of bipedal locomotion in specific moments with the aim of moving faster,\" he said. The researchers think archosauromorphs dominated the river beds of the ancient Pyrenees. The group may have been key to the recovery of ecosystems after the extinction, going on to spread across the supercontinent. \"These tracks represent the first evidence of the vertebrate recovery of the End-Permian extinction,\" Eudald Mujal told BBC News. He said the search was underway for fossilised bones of the animals that made the tracks. The research is published in the journal, PLOS ONE.

{"article": "Microsoft has revealed details of a login system for the next version of Windows based around pictures a user stores on a touchscreen device. Only when parts of an image are tapped or touched in the right order will a user be able to access a device. Experts said it might stop people using weak passwords but could lead to other loopholes that are harder to solve. Microsoft aired the idea of using images to sign on to a device via a blog written by engineers working on Windows 8 - the next version of the Windows operating system expected to be released in late 2012. Windows 8 is designed for touchscreen devices such as tablets and the novel sign-on systems makes use of the sensitive displays they are likely to sport. The familiar process of getting to use a desktop PC or laptop by typing in a password made of up lower and upper case letters as well as numbers was felt to be too \"cumbersome\" for tablets,wrote Microsoft engineer Zach Pace on the blog. The replacement system proposed by Microsoft employs a picture chosen by a user from their collection of images on a device. On this image, users are encouraged to tap on, underline or circle the parts that are important to them. The sequence of gestures, including start and end positions and orientation act as a key to unlock the device. User-testing suggests that the image-based system can grant access to a portable gadget far faster than was possible through text-based passwords, wrote Mr Pace. He stressed that the system would work alongside text-based passwords rather than replace them. If a user failed to properly reproduce the correct gestures fives times in a row they would be prompted for the password they set up when they first used the device. The permutations of taps, touches and circles that could be drawn on a picture was likely to be far higher than those available from text-based passwords, said Prof Alan Woodward from the department of computing at the University of Surrey. That was especially true, he said, when one considered the limited number of words from which most people picked their passwords. \"The initial calculations show that it is likely to provide a level of security that is at least as strong as a password, and frankly, stronger than most passwords chosen by users,\" he added. Graham Cluley, senior security researcher at Sophos, said the research was \"interesting and cute\" but may introduce other security problems. It could, he said, make people vulnerable to \"shoulder surfing\" - a practice better known from cash machines where crooks try to spot a victim's Pin as they tap it into a number pad. \"With normal password entry, what you're doing is asterisked on the screen,\" said Mr Cluley. \"With this gesture input, folks may find it easier to see the movements you are making.\" There might be more value in operating systems encouraging people to use stronger passwords by refusing to let them use dictionary words or ones that are easy to crack, he added.", "abstract": "Using Windows 8 devices could involve signing on by tapping, circling or touching images.", "candidate": "A new way of signing on to a tablet or smartphone could replace the traditional password.", "doc_id": 1038, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "Microsoft aired the idea of using images to sign on to a device via a blog written by engineers working on Windows 8 - the next version of the Windows operating system expected to be released in late 2012.", "explanation": "It was implied that it could replace it as a new method in a blog, so it is accurate.

David dropped his H sounds at the start of words far less often than before the move to the US, the study found. And in a separate video study of wife Victoria, the ex-Spice Girl was found to be \"definitely getting posher\". A university spokesman said the research was part of a study into \"how changing circumstances affect the way we pronounce words\". Researchers contrasted the way Beckhams spoke before and after their move to the US, when David signed for Los Angeles Galaxy. Charles Boorman and Alix Roberts looked at changes in David's speech, while Naomi Proszynska and James Pickett investigated how Victoria spoke. The research revealed that David dropped the H in words such as \"him\" and \"has\" 80% of the time before the move to the US, but only 20% of the time afterwards. Mr Boorman said it was \"clear that Becks, once a broader Cockney, nowadays speaks with more of a standard English accent\". \"In fact, he's even hyper-correcting himself, because he puts Hs into words when it's not really required - in America, they use the H sound more, which explains how he acquired it. \"But my guess is that his dropping of those Cockney vowels was linked to his ambassadorial role for the Olympics and his subsequent high social status.\" Victoria - dubbed Posh Spice during her days with the Spice Girls - was found to correctly pronounce Ls in words such as \"all\" 25% of the time in 1997, with the figure rising to 46% in 2012. \"All\" can be pronounced \"awe\" by \"working-class people in the south-east of England\", the researchers said.

{"article": "ViiV Healthcare, GlaxoSmithKline's HIV business, will acquire two operations specialising in late stage treatments and early phase medicines. It is the latest acquisition in a record year for pharmaceuticals. Global deals have reached $677.5bn, according to Dealogic, up 64% on 2014. Healthcare companies have been forced to buy or swap assets to bolster growing areas of their businesses and shore up their defences as generic versions of previously patented medicines are released in the market. Sales of Advair, an asthma treatment and a bestseller for GSK, are expected to decline following the introduction of a generic version in the US. In the first nine months of the year, GSK reported that sales of Advair fell 19% to \u00a31.2bn, whereas sales of HIV treatments rose 56% to \u00a31.6bn. The company had considered spinning off its 80% stake in ViiV Healthcare through a flotation that could have valued the business at \u00a318bn. However, it decided to hang on to the operation in May. GSK said it would make an upfront payment of $317m to buy Bristol-Myers Squibb's late stage HIV drugs, with a further $518m dependent on sales and royalties. The assets include Fostemsavir, which treats HIV infection and is at the final phase three development stage. That means that it can seek regulatory approval, which is expected to be filed in 2018. It will also pay an initial $33m to acquire pre-clinical and early stage research assets and could hand over $587m if certain development and sales goals are met. Earlier this week, AstraZeneca said it would spend $4bn to buy a 55% stake in Acerta Pharma, a US-Dutch company which is developing a leukaemia treatment that is at the phase three stage. It has an option to buy the remaining 45% in the company. AstraZeneca, which last year saw off a \u00a369bn takeover bid from US rival Pfizer, also announced it would acquire a number of respiratory medicines from Japan's Takeda for $575m. This year has been marked with major deals in the pharmaceuticals sector. Last month, Pfizer announced a $160bn merger with Botox-maker Allergen while in March, GSK said it would swap its cancer drugs portfolio with Novartis' vaccines business.

Her boyfriend Kyrron Jackson, 28, and his friend Nicholas Chandler, 29, were found guilty of murder and jailed for life with a minimum term of 36 years. Granger targeted Mehmet Hassan, 56, in a Mayfair casino in March last year. Judge William Kennedy described the attack as \"pitiless and wicked\", adding: \"It was quite simply an act of brutality which defies reason and compassion.\" Granger's lawyer Orlando Pownall said she only took part in the plot as she was in love with Jackson and \"fell in with his desires\" and now \"deeply regretted\" her actions. \"Her head was turned by Jackson, who she loved, and to some extent by Chandler who was persuasive and superficially charming,\" he said.

{"article": "A smart doorbell, a connected camera, a child's toy and a locator to help monitor children were all found to be vulnerable to straightforward attacks. The default passwords and bad security practices could have leaked data to attackers, said the research teams. However, all four firms have acted on the warnings, tightened up code and closed loopholes. \"The problem with the Internet of Things these days is that everyone is becoming an IT shop whether they like it or not and whether they realise it or not,\" said Tod Beardsley, security research manager at Rapid7, who uncovered problems with two of the devices. While IoT device makers were writing code more confidently, few took the extra design steps to make sure the programming they put into smart devices was secure, the researchers found. Mr Beardsley checked the security in two devices from separate firms: . The way the bear communicated with the web was poorly configured, he found, so attackers could have interrogated it to find out more about its young owner, their family and home network. Similar problems were found with the HereO watch that could have let an attacker add themselves to a group of watches used by a family or other group. HereO's chief technology officer said his team fixed the flaw within four hours of being alerted to it. \"We not only appreciate Rapid7's feedback, but also welcome and embrace the valuable support of the global IoT [internet of things] community in our relentless efforts to maintain a bar-none, zero-tolerance environment for the safety and security of our users,\" said Eli Shemesh. \"As HereO at the time had yet to commercialise its GPS watches, at no point was any child at risk of any malicious activity.\" Separately, researchers at Context IS uncovered security issues with a Motorola Focus outdoor camera. If exploited, the lapses could allow a camera to be taken over and remotely controlled by an attacker and used as an entrance to infiltrate a network to which it was connected. Security experts at Pentest Partners also found problems with Ring - a smart doorbell fitted with a video camera that uses an app to beam video of callers to a phone. But by removing the cover of the gadget and pressing its set-up key it becomes possible to recover the key to the wi-fi network to which it is joined, found the security testing firm. All the security failings found by the researchers were reported to the respective firms and all have now been patched or fixed.

{"article": "In 2014, a report by the public protector said Mr Zuma had \"benefited unduly\" from the upgrades. Mr Zuma said the auditor-general and finance minister should determine how much he should repay to end the dispute. The announcement comes a week before a constitutional hearing on the matter. Africa Live: BBC news updates . How President Zuma's Nkandla home has grown . The refurbishment of the residence in the village of Nkandla, in Mr Zuma's home province of KwaZulu-Natal, has turned into a major political controversy in South Africa. Some of of the money was spent on building an amphitheatre, swimming pool, and cattle enclosure. The opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) and Julius Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), who have called for a corruption investigation, say they are pressing ahead with their court case regardless of the president's latest offer. Following Mr Zuma's announcement #PayBackThemoney is trending in South Africa - this was the phrase EFF MPs chanted at the president in parliament last year. Many commentators seem sceptical. Analysis: Milton Nkosi, BBC News . President Jacob Zuma's delayed willingness to pay back the money spent on the upgrades to his Nkandla residence could be a calculated move to avoid embarrassment at the Constitutional Court hearing expected next week. But it could also be linked to the forthcoming local government election. The Nkandla scandal has been a sore point for the governing African National Congress (ANC) which President Zuma leads, especially as the party faithful go out to campaign for votes. Political analyst Professor Somadoda Fikeni told me that it could also be related to the president being \"politically vulnerable as he enters his 'lame-duck' period and following his mis-appointment of finance ministers\" at the end of last year. Another consideration could well be an attempt to avert another episode of the chaotic scenes we saw during the opening of parliament last year when Julius Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) heckled and disrupted the president's state of the nation address. Security personnel had to be called into the chamber to remove the MPs who would not stop shouting \"pay back the money'\" while President Zuma desperately tried to deliver his speech.

{"article": "Sheikh Ali Salman told the BBC that for national dialogue to be meaningful, the government had to show its willingness to offer \"concrete solutions\". \"We want someone who can speak for the royal family,\" he said. Crown Prince Salman al-Khalifa is seen as a reformist in a court divided on how to respond to opposition demands. Hardliners - centred around the unelected Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, who has been in his post since 1971 - are said to be opposed to a dialogue process which has only just been agreed between the government and six opposition societies. They fear that any concessions will only serve to encourage more demands from opposition leaders they deeply distrust. However, speaking to the BBC during a visit to London, Sheikh Salman insisted that now was the time for dialogue. \"We welcome it, we are ready for it,\" he said. \"We believe that dialogue and negotiations are necessary.\" The al-Wefaq leader acknowledged that many young protesters had lost faith in the main opposition parties. \"A lot of young people do not believe that we should ask for permission to go on a demonstration, or that we should call for a constitutional monarchy with this family, which until now is still killing people\". But he believed that the only way forward was to work with reformists within the Sunni Muslim royal family, including the US- and UK-educated Crown Prince Salman, who has has long been considered a proponent of accommodation with the country's Shia majority. Sheikh Salman noted that hours before King Hamad brought in Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) troops to restore order and crush dissent on 14 March 2011, the crown prince and opposition had agreed a seven-point plan that would have moved Bahrain towards a constitutional monarchy. \"We had an agreement with the crown prince,\" he said. \"The seven principles were announced and then 12 hours later, GCC troops came in and severed the dialogue.\" Asked about the appointment of Senator John Kerry as US secretary of state, Sheikh Salman said he was \"hopeful\" that he would \"do more than his predecessor\", Hillary Clinton. \"US policy needs to be more clear and direct. The United States government needs to pressure harder for human rights and democratic practices. We are told that Mr Kerry has more interest in Bahrain and so we hope he will achieve more.\" On the UK's approach to the crisis in Bahrain, the al-Wefaq leader was more blunt. \"If the UK government and [Prime Minister David] Cameron are serious about putting an end to violence and human rights abuses, then they have to speak out publically. \"It is not enough to say: 'We are privately urging reform.' That has been done for years. Unfortunately, the Bahrain government is not listening to these private conversations. \"So, the question I would ask the British government is: 'Shall you continue to say it privately and not put public pressure?' This is not, I think, a good policy.\" Sheikh Salman also reiterated al-Wefaq's position that it would continue to call for \"peaceful demonstrations\", even though all public gatherings and rallies are currently banned in Bahrain. \"It is the only way open to us to put pressure on the government.\" He also called for the release of 13 opposition leaders and human rights activists who have been sentenced to between five years and life in prison on evidence widely accepted as having been obtained under torture. They were convicted of plotting to overthrow the government. \"These people have a lot of followers in the street.

According to Huawei, several of its cellular communications and software inventions had been used in Samsung's phones without its permission. Samsung told the BBC it would defend its business interests. The specific patents involved have not been disclosed. However, Huawei has said at least some of them are classed as Frand - an acronym referring to \"fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory\". This means the Chinese company has committed itself to offering anyone a licence so long as they agree to a non-excessive compensation. This kind of agreement is common in the tech sector as it makes it possible for different companies' products to communicate and share data formats with each other. Huawei's intellectual property chief indicated it was seeking permission to use some of Samsung's technologies in return rather than seeking a payment. \"Thus far, we have signed cross-licensing agreements with dozens of our competitors,\" said Ding Jianxing. \"We hope Samsung will respect Huawei's R&D investment and patents, stop infringing our patents and get the necessary licence from Huawei, and work together with Huawei to jointly drive the industry forward.\" A Samsung spokesperson responded in an email to the BBC saying \"we will thoroughly review the complaint and take appropriate action to defend Samsung's business interests\". The action comes at a time when Oracle and Google are waiting for a jury to come back with a verdict in a copyright trial that has pitted the two giants against each other in the US.

It is less than the 30-32p farmers estimate it costs to produce each litre but the farming union welcomed it. Asda's announcement comes after protests by dairy farmers at branches of Asda, Morrisons, Lidl and Aldi over the price they are paid for their milk. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) said it was pleased Asda had recognised the \"plight of the dairy industry\" in its \"hour of need\". The industry says a reduction in global demand for milk has led to an over-supply in the UK, creating difficult conditions for many dairy farmers. Asda said it would increase the price it paid per litre to its milk supplier Arla from Monday, with the intention that it be passed directly on to farmers. \"Asda's origins are in dairy farming which is why we are acting in the best interests of our farmers and our customers by increasing the price we pay, introducing the Farmer's Marque label and not passing on any of the costs to customers - our retail price stays the same,\" he said. It is not yet clear whether Arla, Britain's biggest milk co-operative, will pass on the increase in price to farmers. Meurig Raymond, NFU president, urged Arla to ensure it passed the extra payment on \"with immediate effect\". Asda previously announced a price cut of 0.8p per litre - taking the standard litre price to 23.01p for its UK members. On Tuesday, Morrisons said it was launching a new milk brand which will see 10p per litre extra paid to farmers. The Milk for Farmers brand, to be launched in October, means a four pint bottle (2.27 litres), which now sells for 89p, will cost an extra 23p. The four main farming unions - the NFU, the NFU Cymru, NFU Scotland and the Ulster Farmers Union - held an emergency summit on Monday to develop an action plan to tackle falling milk, lamb and arable prices. There have been days of protests by farmers including milk trolley challenges, blockades at distribution centres and even bringing cattle into supermarkets. The average price paid to dairy farmers for milk across the UK is 23.66p - following a drop of 25% in a year. The NFU said that currently Waitrose, Marks & Spencer, Tesco, Sainsbury's and the Co-op have arrangements where a farmer is paid a price above the cost of production for milk.

When asked if she hoped for a rethink, Williams said: \"We deserve it.\" Speaking to BBC Midlands Today, Williams continued: \"What we, as a club, have worked so hard to do for 25 years is to get to the required standard - which we meet.\" Women's Super Rugby, into which there will be a multi-million pound investment by the RFU over the first three years, is aimed at improved playing standards and increasing participation in the game.

{"article": "It is adopting a Cardiff University professor's approach which he says has made the Welsh capital safer than similar sized UK cities. It works by using information from victims to identify violence hotspots, such as in nightclubs and parks. The method has already been adopted by Western Cape in South Africa and Milwaukee in the USA. The man behind it, Professor Jonathan Shepherd of Cardiff University's School of Dentistry, said there was no reason it could not work anywhere in the world. One of the most significant breakthroughs was the sharing of information and joint action by police, councils and emergency departments to try to curb violence. Every time someone comes through accident and emergency with any sort of injury where alcohol is a contributory factor the police are informed. It is claimed that the approach has reduced hospital admissions for violence by 42% in Cardiff, relative to 13 similar cities in Wales and England. More than 100 hospitals across Wales and England have since copied Cardiff. \"It's very low tech and the basic requirements are that the police and local government and health meet from time to time in an organised way,\" Prof Shepherd said. \"That's not rocket science, so we think this is applicable widely, including poor countries [and] low and middle income countries. \"We would very much like to see this implemented in a country like Nigeria, Uganda or South American countries where there's a lot of violence. \"It's in the World Health Organisation-recommended approach but it's easier said than done.\" Prof Shepherd, who was a surgeon at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales, started his work in 1996 after realising that a great deal of violence which resulted in hospital treatment was not known to the police because victims did not report it. He also noticed trends in the types of facial injuries he was treating. Patients were being regularly admitted who had been glassed, and one early success was putting pressure on clubs and city centre pubs to adopt plastic glasses. The move brought about an immediate decline in facial injuries connected to alcohol. However, there were continuing problems with drink-related crimes in the city so Prof Shepherd and his violence and society research group continued their innovative approach. The research group's research into violence, alcohol and late-night safety was recognised with a Queen's Anniversary Prize for excellence in higher education in 2009. Amsterdam decided to adopt the approach after a delegation from the city, including the chief inspector of the police force, visited Cardiff last year.

Yet hundreds of people attended Lytham Crematorium to pay their respects, as a testimony to the power of remembrance and social networking. With the service taking place on Armistice Day, it became a particularly poignant event, drawing armed forces personnel, charities and many members of the public. In fact, before the Last Post was played, a spontaneous round of applause broke out as his coffin was taken from the hearse. We'll never know the answer to the question posed by many people at the service: what would this quiet man have made of his send off? But most suspected he'd have been secretly pleased and proud. The association's standard bearer Stuart Dagger said: \"We are saying goodbye to a hero.\" The Dambusters March played as Mr Percival's coffin was carried into Lytham Park Crematorium at 11:00 GMT on Armistice Day. A two-minute silence was observed around the coffin to mark the anniversary of the World War One armistice before it was carried into the crematorium.

The United Nations Aids agency has called for everyone to get immediate access to the drugs. Around 35 million people are living with HIV and more than 2 million start antiretroviral therapy each year. The discovery of drugs to attack the virus has profoundly changed the way the disease is treated. But there has been fierce debate about when treatment should start. World Health Organization guidelines say treatment should start when there are fewer than 500 white blood cells in every cubic millimetre of blood. The trial on 4,685 people in 35 countries, organised by the US National Institutes of Health, compared this approach with immediate treatment. The trial started in 2011 and was due to run until the end of 2016.

{"article": "Speaking on a visit to Swansea as part of his \"Say No to the EU tour\", he rejected the idea that Wales is a net beneficiary of being in the union. Mr Farage visited an e-cigarette firm and attended a rally of 400 people. Swansea East Labour AM Mike Hedges said many industries were \"highly dependent\" on the EU and it would be a \"giant leap in the dark\" for the UK to leave. David Cameron has promised a referendum on UK membership of the European Union by the end of 2017. During the factory visit, Mr Farage told the BBC: \"Wales gets a rotten deal from Europe. \"Its fishing industry is being destroyed, its steel industry is being seriously damaged, little businesses like this are under threat of going out of business, and there's nothing a politician in the assembly or in Westminster can do about it.\" He said the UK had \"given away control of industry, fishing, farming and business to Brussels\". But Mr Hedges insisted remaining an EU member was very much in Wales' interests. \"We've really become part of it, a lot of industries and commerce are highly dependent on the European community,\" he said. \"I voted to come out last time, but it'd be a giant leap into the dark if we decide to come out now.\" Around 40 people gathered outside the Liberty Stadium to protest against Mr Farage speaking there on Friday evening. The unions Unite and Unison organised the rally. Andy Richards, chair of Unite in Wales, accused Mr Farage of being \"intolerant towards asylum seekers and immigrants\". Addressing the protesters, Llyr Powell from UKIP rejected the accusation the party was intolerant. He said the protest was \"politically motivated\" because \"UKIP is digging in to the core Labour vote in south Wales\". Mr Farage told the rally the referendum was a chance \"to take back control of our lives\". He urged not to listen to a \"pro-EU elite\", which he said included the Kinnock family. \"There's an argument we must confront the Kinnocks with, and virtually everyone in Welsh politics, apart from UKIP. \"It's that far from the EU being good for Wales and business, actually by saying no to the European Union we can take back control of our own lives and put business first. \"The referendum is an opportunity of a lifetime.\" Responding, Lord Kinnock said: \"Personal attacks mean he's losing the argument. \"Wales benefits economically and socially from EU membership, not from UKIP.\"", "abstract": "UKIP leader Nigel Farage has said Wales gets a \"rotten deal\" from the UK's membership of the EU.", "candidate": "UKIP leader Nigel Farage has said Wales \"gets a rotten deal\" from the European Union.", "doc_id": 1105, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "UKIP leader Farage has said Wales \"gets a rotten deal\" from the European Union", "evidence": "During the factory visit, Mr Farage told the BBC: \"Wales gets a rotten deal from Europe.", "explanation": "it makes up Farage's first name", "instruction": "Remove the information about Farage's first name from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about Farage's first name from the summary."]}}

The media watchdog's review found spending on children's programmes in the UK had also fallen from \u00a3103m in 2008 to \u00a388m in 2014. The BBC now accounts for 97% (\u00a384m) of total public service broadcasting spending on children's programmes. Spending by ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 on children's TV has dropped by 74% to \u00a33m in 2014. The review points out there is \"very limited provision of non-animation programming beyond the BBC\". The review found that, despite the success of big budget dramas like Downtown Abbey and Doctor Who, the amount of new UK drama being shown on the main channels has fallen from 627 hours in 2008 to 371 hours in 2014. Although it noted that \"audience satisfaction with drama is stable\". The review found that - following the removal of specific quotas in 2003 - public service programmes in arts and classical music, religion and ethics, and formal education has significantly reduced. Ofcom also warned broadcasters need to adapt as the trend towards online viewing grows. The watchdog found that unless the main TV channels adapt their business models, they would struggle to pay for public service programming in the future. Ofcom warned another challenge for the broadcasters in the future will be delivering news to younger audiences, as viewing of TV news has fallen by 29% among people aged 16-34. It also found certain audience groups were concerned about how they were portrayed on screen - particularly people from BAME backgrounds or people with disabilities - either being under-represented or unfairly portrayed. However, the review found that general audience satisfaction was high with 79% believing PSB was delivering on its purposes, such as delivering trustworthy news and high quality programming reflecting the UK. That figure is up from 69% in 2008. The review also found PSB channels continue to make a significant contribution to UK broadcasting. In 2013, they invested just over \u00a32bn in new UK programmes, not including sports content, compared to around \u00a3350m from non-PSB companies.

{"article": "The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has had to halt deliveries to the Red Sea port of Hudaydah. It said this was partly because it had not received security guarantees. The port has also been targeted by warplanes from a Saudi-led coalition which is backing Yemen's government in its war with the rebel Houthi movement. UN attempts to bring in five cranes to replace those damaged in the attacks have not been successful. The ICRC's Middle East regional director Robert Mardini warned that Yemen, which depends on imports for 90% of its food supplies, was now living on its \"reserves\" and that the \"day will come very soon\" when they run out. He said that despite the focus on the damage and casualties caused by the fighting, thousands of people were dying \"silently\" of complications due to malnutrition, or of minor illnesses or injuries which were not being treated at the 45% of health facilities that are still functioning. The conflict, which escalated in March 2015, has left at least 7,500 people dead and 40,000 injured, according to the United Nations. But almost 19 million people are in need of some form of humanitarian assistance. Seven million people do not know where their next meal is coming from and more than three million, including 2.1 million children, are suffering from acute malnutrition. The UN's emergency relief co-ordinator, Stephen O'Brien, called on the warring parties to guarantee more access to ports to let in food, fuel and medicine imports on Monday. He told the BBC the situation was \"very desperate\", and that he had seen children so \"severely malnourished\" that he feared they would not survive another day. Earlier this month, the UN appealed for $2.1bn (\u00c2\u00a31.7bn) to provide life-saving assistance to 12 million people in Yemen over the next year. But it has so far received only $43m. On Tuesday, Mr O'Brien was forced to cancel a visit to the city of Taiz, which is besieged by rebel fighters, reportedly after his convoy came under fire. In a separate development on Tuesday, UN human rights officials said they had evidence of the recruitment of child soldiers in Yemen, mostly by groups affiliated with the Houthis.

{"article": "It is in fact the Atacama desert in Chile, one of the driest places on Earth. Average rainfall here is les than 0.1mm (0.004 in) per year and there are many regions which have not seen any precipitation for decades. But while there is little rain, the clouds here do carry humidity. Coastal fog forms on Chile's shore and then moves inland in the form of cloud banks. The locals call it \"camanchaca\". The fog is made up of minuscule drops of water which are so light they do not fall as rain. During a particularly severe drought in 1956, scientist Carlos Espinosa Arancibia had an idea. The retired maths and physics professor from the University of Chile carried out a series of experiments in the highest hills near the city of Antofagasta. There, he came up with the idea of the fog catcher: netting with tiny openings of approximately 1mm across to capture the tiny water droplets in the fog. The droplets accumulate in the netting and form a bigger drop which eventually runs off the netting into a canal underneath. From there, it is channelled through a pipe to containers at the base of the hills, ready for use. And the research continues today. The town of Pena Blanca boasts one of the biggest study centres for the fog catchers. There are six big nets in the hills overlooking the town. Technical adviser Nicolas Schneider says that thanks to the fog catcher they have managed to combat the desertification of the region. He says that 100 hectares now are again covered in the flora once typical for the region. \"We're planning to provide local families with water from the fog catcher in the near future,\" Mr Schneider says. At the heart of the community is a small building which also uses water from the fog catcher: the town's small artisanal brewery. Fog Catcher Brewery is small. It only produces has three vats and one cold store producing about 24,000 litres per year, but it is the pride and joy of its owner, Miguel Carcuro. \"The water from the camanchaca is of excellent quality and gives our beer a special quality,\" he says. The project's backers say the fog catchers are cheap and sustainable. An average-sized fog catcher of 40sq m costs between $1,000 (\u00a3635) and $1,500 depending on the material used. They say its impact on the environment is minimal as the metal posts can be discreetly hidden among vegetation. As the water is transported down the hill by gravity, there is no extra cost involved for transport, they say. It is an idea which has been exported to other arid regions in Peru and Mexico. The largest expanse of fog catchers is located in Tojquia in Guatemala, where 60 fog catchers trap 4,000 litres of water a day. Prof Pilar Cereceda of the University of Chile says she hopes that within a decade Chile will have enough fog catchers to supply the whole Atacama region. \"I dream of the day in which the fog catchers can compete with desalination plants, which is not environmentally friendly.\"", "abstract": "The dry, red earth could almost be mistaken for a Martian landscape.", "candidate": "In the middle of one of the driest deserts in the world, a small community is using fog catchers to capture the tiny droplets of water which form in the clouds.", "doc_id": 1110, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "It is in fact the Atacama desert in Chile, one of the driest places on Earth.

The new trial marks the first time the treatment has been tested in the UK. Patients are being enrolled for a trial of the treatment at Edinburgh University's Muir Maxwell Epilepsy Centre, based at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh, and Great Ormond Street Hospital. The Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow and Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool are also driving the study. There are further centres in the US, France and Poland.

But experts questioned which diets people could stick to in real life. The researchers said most dieters ended up cutting out a mixture of protein, carbohydrate and fat from their meals so the scientists set out to explore the relative contribution of each food type. It required experiments that could not be repeated outside a laboratory environment, in which the content of every meal was precisely controlled. The 19 volunteers were all obese with an average body fat percentage of 40% at the start of the trial. They spent five days on a diet designed to match how many calories their bodies were burning. It consisted of 50% carbohydrate, 35% fat and 15% protein. They then moved to the focal point of the study for the next six days, in which calorie intake was cut by 30% or around 800 calories per day. Half were placed on a low-carb diet of 30% carbohydrate, 49% fat and 21% protein. The rest were placed on a low-fat diet - 72% carbohydrate, 7% fat and 21% protein. After those six days, the participants had a couple of weeks to recover before starting all over again and trying the other diet. Their scientific presentation said: \"Body fat loss was 67% greater after six days of low fat versus low carbohydrate.\" Dr Kevin Hall, from the NIH National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, told BBC News: \"It's not easy, these folks had to eat the same meals every day. \"This was very strictly controlled and they had to eat the food provided and nothing else, the diets got pretty boring pretty quickly.\" While providing interesting physiological insights, those comments raise concern in experts trying to help people lose weight outside strict laboratory conditions. Susan Jebb, a professor of diet and population health at the University of Oxford, told the BBC News website: \"This is a neat study, but it is very small and designed to investigate the metabolism of fat and carbohydrate under highly controlled conditions, rather than longer-term weight control, where behavioural factors become increasingly important. \"In 'real life', other factors such as the acceptability of the dietary programme, are likely to be an important factor associated with adherence and, for the most part, adherence over the longer term is likely to make a bigger difference to people's weight.\" Dr Hall said long-term forecasts were \"fraught with difficulties\" but said their mathematical models suggested that the low-fat diet would lead to more long-term body fat loss. The idea behind the merit of the low-fat diet is generating \"fat imbalance\". The low-fat, high-carb, diet does increase the amount of fat being burned by the body, but preventing the fat entering the body in the first place seemed to have greater impact. Cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra was concerned about the health impact of such a low-fat diet. \"The total fat intake of 7% is way too low for this to be sustainable and would likely lead to nutritional deficiencies for the essential fatty acids and the fat soluble vitamins. \"For the best health, even in the short term, eat real unprocessed foods, concentrate on good nutrition and stop counting calories!\"", "abstract": "Eating a low-fat, rather than a low-carb diet leads to a greater loss of body fat, according to US National Institutes of Health scientists.", "candidate": "US scientists say they have found the most effective way to lose weight - by eating the same food every day.", "doc_id": 1129, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "US scientists say they have found the biggest factor in long term weight loss is likely to be adherence.", "evidence": "\"In 'real life', other factors such as the acceptability of the dietary programme, are likely to be an important factor associated with adherence and, for the most part, adherence over the longer term is likely to make a bigger difference to people's weight.\"", "explanation": "The summary does not accurately reflect how the scientists feel people can best lose weight outside of a study condition.", "instruction": "Rewrite the summary by using information the scientists stated about the factor most likely to be related to long term weight loss which is adherence.", "instruction_list": ["Rewrite the summary by using information the scientists stated about the factor most likely to be related to long term weight loss which is adherence."]}}

He then broke down in tears as he dedicated his award to the victims of the Paris terror attacks.

Reflecting on the Mercury Prize, he said: \"I always believed in my music but after Paris happened, I was very down. \"I didn't think I would win. I always wanted to be nominated for this award, but I didn't think to myself that I'd win it. I always made a joke about it!\" The musician's debut album is a searingly-personal collection of piano-based songs, which critics have called \"bold\", \"brilliant\" and \"astonishing\". It touches on his turbulent upbringing in Edmonton, London, as well as the three years he spent sleeping rough in Paris. \"I made this album thinking only about 50 people would listen to it,\" he told the BBC. \"My music isn't mainstream music. \"It goes to show that you've just got to be sincere in your work and people will listen to it.\" The Mercury Prize recognises innovative albums produced in the UK and Ireland.

It contains policies on nationalising railways and renewing the Trident weapons system and suggests Labour will not leave the EU without a deal. Labour would not comment on the leak but the Tories called it \"a shambles\". According to the draft, Labour would: . On energy, Labour would have at least one publicly-owned supplier in every region of the country, with the government controlling the transmission and distribution grids. First it would introduce an \"immediate emergency price cap\" of \u00a31,000 a year. The manifesto still has to be approved by around 80 Labour figures, including the shadow cabinet and the party's National Executive Committee. The final version will form the foundation of Labour's pitch to voters on the 8 June general election. A spokesman for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: \"We do not comment on leaks. We will announce our policies in our manifesto, which is our plan to transform Britain for the many, not the few.\" The draft document is seen by some senior Labour figures as the most left-wing manifesto since the party was led by Michael Foot in 1983. It certainly appears to be the most detailed in a generation with a 20-point plan for workers' rights alone. Many individual policies are likely to be popular - not every privatisation is seen as having been a success and polling suggests the commitments to renationalise the railways and cap energy prices aren't as controversial as critics would claim . But opponents and sceptical voters will await further detail behind the assertion that everything has been costed. Privately, many Labour MPs believe Jeremy Corbyn will get the manifesto he wants but in return he must take full responsibility if voters find it less appealing than he does . Many of the policies have been previously announced by Labour or were proposed by Mr Corbyn during his successful leadership campaign. These include banning fracking, and the draft manifesto also says nuclear power would continue to be supported. On welfare, Labour says it would scrap benefit sanctions and the so-called \"bedroom tax\" and restore housing benefit for people aged under 21. The triple lock protecting the state pension would be maintained, and the retirement age would not increase beyond 66. The draft was initially leaked to the Mirror and the Daily Telegraph. A Conservative spokesman said: \"This is a total shambles. Jeremy Corbyn's plans to unleash chaos on Britain have been revealed. \"The commitments in this dossier will rack up tens of billions of extra borrowing for our families and will put Brexit negotiations at risk.\" In other general election news, the Conservatives are pledging to continue meeting the Nato target of spending 2% of GDP on defence.

{"article": "The angry response came after secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson said the US should deny Beijing access to new islands in the South China Sea. Two state-run papers carry editorials strongly criticising his comments. The hawkish Global Times tabloid warned that any such action would lead to \"a large-scale war\". Beijing has been building artificial islands on reefs in waters also claimed by other nations. Images published late last year show military defences on some islands, a think-tank says. Speaking at his confirmation hearing on Wednesday, Mr Tillerson likened China's island-building to Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. \"We're going to have to send China a clear signal that first, the island-building stops and second, your access to those islands also is not going to be allowed.\" China's official response, from foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang, was muted. China had the right to conduct \"normal activities\" in its own territory, he said. Asked specifically about the remark on blocking access, he said he would not respond to hypothetical questions. But editorials in the China Daily and the Global Times were more direct in their comments. The China Daily suggested Mr Tillerson's remarks showed ignorance of Sino-US relations and diplomacy in general. \"Such remarks are not worth taking seriously because they are a mish-mash of naivety, shortsightedness, worn-out prejudices and unrealistic political fantasies,\" it said. \"Should he act on them in the real world, it would be disastrous. \"As many have observed, it would set a course for devastating confrontation between China and the US. After all, how can the US deny China access to its own territories without inviting the latter's legitimate, defensive responses?\" The Global Times, a nationalist daily, suggested that Mr Tillerson's \"astonishing\" comments came because \"he merely wanted to curry favour from senators and increase his chances of being confirmed by intentionally showing a tough stance toward China\". China would ensure his \"rabble rousing\" would not succeed, it went on. \"Unless Washington plans to wage a large-scale war in the South China Sea, any other approaches to prevent Chinese access to the islands will be foolish.\" The Obama administration has spoken out strongly against the island-building, pledged to ensure freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and sending navy ships to sail in contested areas. But it has not threatened to block access to the islands, a step likely to enrage Beijing.

Mr Corbyn focused all his questions on tax, saying Conservative MEPs have voted against new EU-wide country-by-country reporting measures, while the government had cut tax official jobs and shut down tax offices. The PM said the new reporting measures were \"based on the work we've been doing\" and had been proposed by the UK's commissioner, Lord Hill.. The leaders also traded blows over how transparent overseas territories would have to be under the new regime. Mr Corbyn said the Cayman Islands premier was \"celebrating victory\" because beneficial ownership information would not be available publicly or directly to UK agencies. The PM said overseas and crown dependencies would provide beneficial ownership information, but would not make the information public because otherwise some might have \"walked away from this co-operation altogether\". Mr Cameron, who has faced questions about his own tax arrangements and his father's offshore investment firm, aimed a joke at Mr Corbyn's recently-released tax return, saying the \"late, chaotic, inaccurate and uncosted\" document was a metaphor for Labour Party policy. Mr Corbyn hit back, saying he paid more tax than companies owned by people Mr Cameron \"might know quite well\".

{"article": "Andrew Haldane said in a speech he was downbeat over the UK economy because of weaker global growth, low wage growth and financial and political risks. \"Put in rather plainer English, I am gloomier,\" Mr Haldane said. \"This implies interest rates could remain lower for longer, certainly than I had expected three months ago.\" Global markets have tumbled this week, with investors disconcerted at the lack of growth in Europe and especially Greece, the impact of Ebola, and worrying economic data from China and the US. Previously, UK interest rates had been expected to rise early next year. Mr Haldane made his remarks at a speech to local business leaders in Kenilworth, where he described the UK's economy as \"writhing in both agony and ecstasy\". He said there were still plenty of reasons to be cheerful. Growth is set to be the fastest of any major economy this year and inflation and borrowing costs are low, he said. However, he said the \"reasons to be fearful\" included productivity and wages, which had not risen. \"If there is genuine uncertainty about the path of the economy, the optimal policy response may be to avoid the worst outcomes,\" said Mr Haldane. Sterling dropped 0.5% against the dollar following his remarks. Share trading on the London market has been volatile. Mr Haldane's caution about global economic prospects were echoed by the Chancellor, George Osborne, who told the BBC that the worldwide economy was \"more unstable than it has been for some time\". Mr Osborne would not comment on Mr Haldane's remarks. But he said there were \"a lot of global risks out there at the moment\" affecting the international economy. \"Interest rates are entirely a matter for the independent Bank of England, the monetary policy committee there,\" Mr Osborne said.

That is all the more reason why in the UK we have to stick to the stability we have won.\" He said it was important to \"make sure Britain is well protected as we're in these stormy international economic waters\".

{"article": "The company says it has called a board meeting for 28 July and the investment decision is on the agenda. BBC correspondent John Moylan said the firm's board is expected to give the plant the go-ahead. It was initially due to cost \u00a312bn, but recent estimates put the cost at \u00a318bn. Last week the new Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond said the government remained committed to building a new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset, despite the rising potential cost to the consumer of the electricity it will produce. He said Hinkley was vital to a strong economy and still worth the cost. As part of the 35-year deal signed with France's EDF in 2013 to build the plant, the government agreed to pay \u00a392.50 for each megawatt hour of electricity. Wholesale energy prices have fallen since the price was agreed, leaving the government to make up the difference. The UK's National Audit Office estimated future top-up payments would rise from \u00a36.1bn to \u00a329.7bn over the length of the contract. Is Hinkley Point C finally about to get the green light? It's hard to interpret EDF's announcement late on Thursday night in any other way. For the company to announce that it had called a board meeting and that the Hinkley decision is on the agenda sends a strong signal that it expects approval to be given. It's also clear that the French government is on board. With its 85% stake in EDF, its approval would have been needed for the company to move to this crucial stage. But the board still has to take the decision. With so much at stake, the possibility of a further delay can't be ruled out. Hinkley Point C, which would provide 7% of the UK's total electricity requirements, had originally been meant to open in 2017. But it has been hit in recent months by concerns about EDF's financial capacity to handle the project. While one third of the \u00a318bn capital costs of the project are being met by Chinese investors, Hinkley Point would remain an enormous undertaking for the stressed French company. In its statement confirming next week's board meeting, EDF said Hinkley Point C was a \"major element\" of its low-carbon growth strategy. The two \"reactors at Hinkley Point would strengthen EDF's presence in Britain, a country where its subsidiary EDF Energy already operates 15 nuclear reactors and is the largest electricity supplier by volume,\" it added. Welcoming the news of the meeting, the Business and Energy Secretary Greg Clark said: \"It's clear that we are open for business as we come closer to sealing the deal on this major investment in British infrastructure and British jobs. \"New nuclear is an essential part of our plan for a secure, clean and affordable energy system that will power the economy throughout this century. \"This is a welcome decision from EDF, and we look forward to the outcome.\"", "abstract": "The French energy giant EDF is expected to make its long-awaited final investment decision on a new nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset next week.", "candidate": "French energy giant EDF says it expects to give the go-ahead to the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station next week.", "doc_id": 1158, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "Is Hinkley Point C finally about to get the green light?

{"article": "He accused Suliman Gani in Parliament of backing the militant group as he questioned Sadiq Khan's judgement in sharing a platform with him. Mr Gani has said claims he backs IS are defamatory and must be retracted. Earlier on Wednesday, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon apologised for making similar claims. At Prime Minister's Questions in April, Mr Cameron said Mr Khan had appeared on a platform nine times with Mr Gani, whom the prime minister alleged \"supports IS\". Mr Gani said at the time that he wanted to take legal action against Mr Cameron but was unable to do so because of Parliamentary privilege rules, which protect MPs' freedom of speech in the Commons. In a statement, Downing Street said Mr Cameron was referring to reports that Mr Gani supports \"an\" Islamic state. A Number 10 spokesman said: \"The prime minister is clear this does not mean Mr Gani supports the organisation Daesh and he apologises to him for any misunderstanding.\" Several senior Conservatives attacked Mr Gani at the height of the London mayoral race and accused Mr Khan - who was elected London Mayor last week - of associating with extremists, an approach which Labour said was illustrative of a \"divisive, dog-whistle campaign\". Mr Fallon apologised for an \"inadvertent error\" in labelling Mr Gani an IS sympathiser. He made the claim about the Tooting preacher during a BBC interview, as he defended the Conservatives' London mayoral election campaign. In a message on social media last month, Mr Gani said he had \"condemned IS wholeheartedly\" since its inception and that it in no way represented his beliefs. He wrote: \"Saying I support Islamic State is untrue and highly damaging to my reputation. \"I am totally opposed to so-called Islamic State which I view as a terrorist and inhumane organisation. Indeed as an imam and community leader, I have campaigned against the evils of Islamic State to my fellow Muslims and to others in the community.\" Dr Shuja Shafi of the Muslim Council of Britain welcomed the \"long overdue apology\", but said \"such smear-by-association has become all too common for Muslims and Muslim organisations\". \"For the real extremists we are all opposed to, such tactics will only provide fresh new examples of a society not willing to accept Muslims for who they are,\" he said.

{"article": "Devon and Cornwall Police has announced a 73% drop in mental health patients detained in cells since January 2015. Dr Anne Hicks, who runs the A&E department at Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, said they had seen a sharp rise in evening and weekend cases. She warned the police policy was causing \"tension\" between the services. In January 2015, Chief Constable Shaun Sawyer wrote in confidence to NHS bosses and told them police would take mentally ill people to hospital and other places of safety, rather than keep them in custody. It said that police would be encouraged to call an ambulance if they detained a mentally ill adult, and should take a child to an A&E Department. Dr Hicks, mental health lead for the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said \"agitated mental health patients\" were brought into the hospital by officers, which \"created real tension between us and the police\". She said the police policy had coincided with an overall rise in mental health admissions after normal working hours finished at 17:00 BST, which she estimated to be around 20%. \"We don't feel we can deliver that safe nurturing space those patients need,\" she added. Suzy Franklin, branch secretary of Unison at the hospital, said the rise added pressure to A&E, which \"has a knock-on effect for waiting times\". In his letter Chief Constable Sawyer said health services should be providing care for mentally ill people. It said: \"Nearly every week my force is experiencing detentions where mentally ill people are in our custody centres for a number of unacceptable hours and even days. This cannot be allowed to continue.\" The letter said the force would take mentally ill people to hospital and other places of safety rather than keep them in custody. Ordinarily those people who police believe to be a threat to themselves or others due to mental illness would be sent to a secure part of a mental hospital. Since the letter, there have been 192 detentions under the Mental Health Act - a drop of 73% compared to the previous 12 months. Mr Sawyer said mental health calls put \"an awful lot of time and pressure\" on officers as they know \"they're not the best person to deal with them\". He said the \"intention was not to pass\" them on to hospitals, but if they are not at risk to themselves or others, then \"A&E is the next best place to consider before a police cell\".

{"article": "Intense negotiations are under way between political parties amid public anger at a one-off levy of up to 10% being imposed on savers. President Nicos Anastasiades said refusing the bailout would have led to the collapse of the country's banks. The speaker of the European Parliament has called for the levy to be revised to protect small-scale bank customers. The 10bn-euro ($13bn; \u00c2\u00a38.6bn) deal agreed by the EU and IMF in Brussels marks a radical departure from previous international aid packages. Under its terms, people in Cyprus with less than 100,000 euros in their accounts would have to pay a one-time tax of 6.75%. Those with sums over that threshold would pay 9.9% in tax. Depositors will be compensated with the equivalent amount in shares in their banks. It is believed that eurozone leaders, particularly in Germany, insisted on the levy because of the large amount of Russian capital kept in Cypriot banks, amid fears of money-laundering. Q&A: Cyprus bailout . UK to help troops . President Anastasiades, who was elected only last month, is due to address the country shortly (from 18:00 GMT). He said in a statement earlier that Cyprus had had to choose between the \"catastrophic scenario of disorderly bankruptcy or the scenario of a painful but controlled management of the crisis\". The president has been meeting with members of the parliament's finance committee, his office said. On Saturday the head of the committee, Nicholas Papadopoulos, expressed shock at the deal, saying it was \"much worse than expected\". The president's Democratic Rally party - which has 20 seats in the 56-member assembly - needs support from other factions to ratify the bailout. A spokesman for one of its coalition partners, the Democratic Party, told BBC News they wanted assurances that the deal would resolve the problems facing Cyprus before voting in favour. Opposition leader George Lillikas, an independent, said the president had \"betrayed the people's vote\". The speaker of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, argued in a newspaper interview that there should be an exemption from the levy for savers, for example, who had less than 25,000 euros in their accounts. By Gavin HewittEurope editor . \"The solution must be socially acceptable,\" Mr Schulz, who belongs to Germany's opposition Social Democrats, told Germany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, defended the levy. \"With this deal, the responsible people are partly included in those countries and not only the taxpayers in other countries,\" she said at a party meeting in her home constituency. \"And I think it's right that we went down that road and I think it's a good step which will certainly make it easier for us to approve the help for Cyprus.\" As with past eurozone bailouts, the deal must be approved by the lower house of parliament in Germany, the EU's biggest economy. If the levy goes ahead, it will affect many non-Cypriots with bank accounts, including UK expatriates. However, depositors in the overseas arms of Cypriot banks will not be hit. Bank of Cyprus UK and Laiki Bank UK both confirmed on their websites that there would be no impact. Chancellor George Osborne said the UK would compensate any government employees and military personnel whose bank accounts were affected. The levy itself will not take effect until Tuesday, following a public holiday, but action is being taken to control electronic money transfers over the weekend.", "abstract": "Cyprus's parliament has postponed an emergency session on a controversial bailout deal for the country's banks.", "candidate": "Cyprus's parliament is due to vote on a controversial EU-IMF bailout deal later.", "doc_id": 1171, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Cyprus's parliament voted on a controversial EU-IMF bailout deal.", "evidence": "The 10bn-euro ($13bn; \u00c2\u00a38.6bn) deal agreed by the EU and IMF in Brussels marks a radical departure from previous international aid packages.", "explanation": "According to the source the deal has already been agreed on and finalized.", "instruction": "Remove the information about that it is due to be voted on from the summary.

After Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference last week he wanted to \"remove the whole idea of the benefit cap\", Owen Smith, his shadow work and pensions secretary, said it was \"very clear\" Labour was only opposing plans to reduce the limit of working-age benefits to \u00a320,000, and to \u00a323,000 in London. In an interview with the BBC's Newsnight, Mr Smith acknowledged the principle of a welfare cap had wide public support and it would be \"foolhardy\" for Labour to set themselves \"unthinkingly\" against public opinion. But Mr Corbyn told the New Statesman the cap was responsible for \"social cleansing\" in his Islington North constituency, with people forced to leave their homes because they could not afford their rent. \"It's devastating for children, devastating for the family and very bad for the community as a whole,\" he added. His spokesman said Mr Corbyn had \"laid out his position\" and the policy would now go through a \"collective decision-making process\". Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Smith said the party leader had \"clearly signalled that he wants Labour to review and refresh our thinking on social security, especially in respect of the benefit cap, and that's a challenge I know the entire party will rise to in the months ahead\". Before Mr Corbyn was elected leader, the party was split over the Welfare Reform and Work Bill, which will reduce the cap to \u00a320,000 outside of London, and \u00a323,000 in London. In July, 48 Labour MPs rebelled against the decision by the then interim leader Harriet Harman to abstain and instead voted against the bill. The Conservative Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said \"chaos and confusion\" surrounded Labour's position. \"Conservatives believe that nobody should be able to claim more in welfare than the average family earns by going out to work,\" he said. \"By pledging to reverse this position, it's clear that today's Labour Party are simply not on the side of working people. They are still the same old welfare party - wanting to borrow more to spend more on benefits.\" In his interview, Mr Corbyn also said scrapping the Trident nuclear weapons system would become Labour Party policy if its conference votes for the change next week. Conferences votes are not technically binding on the party leadership. But asked whether scrapping Trident would become party policy if conference votes for it, Mr Corbyn said: \"Well, it would be, of course, because it would have been passed at conference.\"", "abstract": "Jeremy Corbyn has reaffirmed his desire to scrap the welfare cap after differences with his shadow cabinet, calling the policy \"devastating\".", "candidate": "Jeremy Corbyn has said he wants to scrap the cap on the amount people can claim in benefits.", "doc_id": 1172, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Corbyn has said he wants to scrap the cap on the amount people can claim in benefits.", "evidence": "After Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference last week he wanted to \"remove the whole idea of the benefit cap\", Owen Smith, his shadow work and pensions secretary, said it was \"very clear\" Labour was only opposing plans to reduce the limit of working-age benefits to \u00a320,000, and to \u00a323,000 in London.", "explanation": "it makes up Corbyn's first name", "instruction": "Remove the information about Corbyn's first name from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about Corbyn's first name from the summary."]}}

Remarks repeated \"out of context\" might not be covered, he suggested. He also warned MPs against revealing details of court orders in Parliament. When court proceedings were active, parliamentarians should only refer to them in Parliament in \"the most exceptional of circumstances\", he said in a speech in London. MPs are protected from prosecution over statements made in Parliament under what is known as parliamentary privilege - one of the oldest rights enshrined in British law. But there was controversy earlier this year when Lib Dem MP John Hemming use it to name footballer Ryan Giggs in Parliament as someone who had been granted an injunction preventing reporting of his private life. Mr Hemming justified the move - criticised by many other MPs at the time - by arguing that the information was already widely known to the public and he was not abusing the privilege as he could have named the footballer outside the Commons without being accused of contempt of court. Parliamentary privilege was also used by Lord Stoneham to disclose a privacy order obtained by former chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, Sir Fred Goodwin. Referring to the issue of parliamentary privilege, Mr Grieve said that while - as an MP himself - he defended the right of Parliament to determine its own affairs it was \"important to remember these are the privileges of Parliament as a whole and not that of the individual member\". \"It ill serves the parliamentary process if court orders are openly flouted for no good reason,\" he added. \"It is not for a parliamentarian to ignore the careful and measured approach of a judge when deciding if an injunction should be granted. \"The House of Commons has resolved that the sub judice rule applies to proceedings which are active and they shall not be referred to in any motion, debate or question. \"Parliament and the Courts should each be left to do their work without interference by the other - save in the most exceptional of circumstances.\" Mr Grieve, the government's senior law officer, also suggested the media must \"beware\" reporting anything said in Parliament which flouted court orders. The extent of legal protection available to them in such cases had yet to be \"authoritatively decided\", he said. \"It is still an open question as to whether something said in Parliament in breach of a court order may be repeated in the press,\" he added. \"The privilege to report parliamentary proceedings, which is provided by the parliamentary papers act and covers Hansard, does not necessarily extend to all publications which are not published by order of Parliament. \"It is likely that it does extend to a fair and accurate report of proceedings in Parliament.

The census found 32% in Wales have no religion, against a UK figure of 25%. The Church in Wales said Christianity was \"no longer the default setting\" for many, but the picture was complex. Of those in Wales who described themselves as believers, the number of Christians fell by 14 percentage points to 57%. Prof Dawkins said: \"I congratulate the people of Wales in coming out ahead of the rest of the United Kingdom in this respect - well done.\" He told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales that he believed in the \"wonder\" of scientific truth. He said: \"People who are educated in religion are positively encouraged not to investigate, not to think sceptically about why they are here, but instead to accept what people wrote 2,000 years ago. \"I guess we do need focal points for communities but you can say also that religion has been a focal point for all sorts of backward, indeed bigoted, thinking about homosexuality, about abortion, the right to die, that we're seeing at the moment.\" He added that research commissioned by his foundation meant that the outlook for Christianity in the UK was \"even more pessimistic\" than the census data suggested. He said many of those who put themselves down at Christian did so because they thought of themselves \"as a good person\" rather than due to belief in the virgin birth, or of Jesus Christ as the son of God.

{"article": "The company said it had faced a \"chorus of music label representatives and artists\" accusing it of \"mistreating\" songwriters and performers. Hank Green, a prominent video producer and entrepreneur, said YouTube gave musicians \"new revenue streams\". The row comes as the video-sharing website renews its agreements with major record labels. Prominent voices in the music industry have accused YouTube of paying low royalties for music video streams and turning a blind eye to copyright infringement. In March, the Recording Industry Association of America said YouTube paid \"meagre\" royalties when compared to subscription music services such as Apple Music and Spotify. On Monday, music manager Irving Azoff, formerly in charge of Ticketmaster and who now represents artists such as Christina Aguilera, said artists were paid a \"pittance\" on the advertising-funded site. In an open letter, he said YouTube did not allow musicians to put their tracks behind its YouTube Red pay-wall to earn more revenue. He also accused YouTube of \"hiding behind\" a so-called \"safe harbour\" provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which stops websites being held responsible for copyright infringement by users, in some circumstances. Trying to keep copyright music off YouTube was \"an impossible, expensive game of 'whack-a-mole',\" he said. \"When the artist sends a 'take down' it should be a 'stay down'.\" YouTube said comparing subscription services to free advertising-funded websites was \"like comparing what a cab driver earns from fares to what they earn showing ads in their taxi\". In a blog post, the company said it paid \"a majority\" - more than 50% - of its advertising income to content creators and the music industry. However, it added that the average YouTube user listened to only one hour of music a month, compared to the 55 hours a month it said Spotify subscribers consumed. The company said its Content ID technology could detect when copyright music was uploaded to the website and automatically dealt with 99.5% of copyright claims. It said record labels had the choice of whether to earn advertising revenue from unauthorised uploads or have them blocked indefinitely, and that half of the $3bn (\u00c2\u00a32bn) it had paid out to the music industry came from monetising these \"unauthorised uploads\" by the public. Income from its subscription service YouTube Red, available in the US, was shared with content creators and musicians in the same way as advertising revenue. YouTube has been separately criticised by video-makers who say Content ID does not respect the \"fair use\" of television and film extracts, which is protected by a provision of the DMCA. It has attempted to address the problem by allowing disputed videos to earn advertising revenue which is kept until the correct copyright holder can be identified. Hank Green, co-founder of the world's biggest online video convention VidCon, described YouTube's Content ID technology as a \"win-win\" situation for record labels. \"[Record labels] can take the video down, or they can claim the revenue for themselves... this is not an expensive game of 'whack-a-mole', it's 100% automated,\" he wrote in a reply to Mr Azoff. \"They've been given a new 10-figure revenue stream of claimed fan creations that they never would have had without YouTube.\" Singer Dave Giles, a regular performer at YouTube events, said musicians did benefit from advertising-supported streams on the video site. \"It was interesting that when Taylor Swift took her songs off Spotify, she kept them on YouTube,\" he told the BBC. \"If it wasn't really helping her career, surely she should have taken them off there as well. \"Spotify might be paying more per stream than YouTube, but they have more subscribers. There's an argument that YouTube should be doing more to push its subscription model, but they are still rolling it out. \"It's still more than artists get on Facebook.

Jerry Langford, the Woodland Trust's director in Wales gave a guarded welcome and said the plans were \"considered and enlightened\". \"If these changes do lead to more native woodland creation and a new urgency for the restoration of ancient woodlands planted with conifers, this could be the start of a new 'age of the tree' in Wales,\" he said. Any sell-off in Wales would release resources to the FC to purchase other areas of land not currently under its management to increase their public benefit.

{"article": "A defence official said in a statement on Wednesday that its nuclear programme had \"long been in the full-fledged stage of miniaturisation\". However, analysts say while there is evidence the programme is advancing, it is difficult to assess its true extent. The claim comes hours after North Korea cancelled a planned visit by the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. Mr Ban was due to visit an industrial complex in the Kaesong economic zone run jointly by the North and South and would have been the first UN chief to visit North Korea in more than 20 years. Speaking at a forum in Seoul, he said the move was \"deeply regrettable\" and that no explanation was given. North Korea previously claimed it had miniaturised a device for the nuclear test it conducted in 2013 but experts have continued to debate how far along that process it is. Dr John Swenson-Wright, head of the Asia programme at the Chatham House think-tank, said that while there was \"growing evidence of the North's increasing technical sophistication\", caution was necessary in interpreting North Korea's latest statement. Some have interpreted the latest moves, together with some recent high-profile executions, as attempts by leader Kim Jong-un to assert his authority. The latest announcement on nuclear advances follows the publication earlier this month of pictures apparently showing a missile being launched from a submarine. Some experts have said the images may have been doctored. Responding to the latest claims, the South Korean defence ministry urged the North to stop developing nuclear weapons.

Professor Rona Mackie, from the British Association of Dermatologists, said: \"Total sun protection with high factor suncream on all the time is not ideal, in terms of vitamin D levels. \"Even Australia has changed its policy on this. They're now producing charts showing parts of Australia where sun protection may not be required during some parts of the year. \"Some of the messages about sun exposure have been too negative. UK summer sunshine isn't desperately strong. We don't have many days in the year when it is very intense. \"What's changed is that we're now saying that exposure of 10 to 15 minutes to the UK summer sun, without suncream, several times a week is probably a safe balance between adequate vitamin D levels and any risk of skin cancer.\" Official government advice already recommends vitamin D supplements for pregnant women and children aged under five. But the experts who wrote the joint statement say mothers often are not made aware of this recommendation. They suggest women consult their GP. Winter levels of vitamin D can be helped by a break in the tropical sun - or by eating oily fish, liver and fortified margarine. Cancer Research UK's chief clinician, Professor Peter Johnson, said: \"A good diet and sensible sun exposure will be adequate for the great majority of the UK population to minimise their cancer risk. \"The area of vitamin D and cancer is complex. \"There's some evidence, which is strongest in bowel cancer, that low levels of vitamin D in the blood correlate with the risk of developing cancer. \"But that doesn't mean those low levels cause bowel cancer. \"We think overall that low levels of vitamin D are unlikely to be major contributors to the chances of developing cancer in the UK population.\" The joint statement also highlighted questions about vitamin D that warrant further research. These include finding out the optimal levels of vitamin D, and more detail about the role of dietary sources and supplements.", "abstract": "New health advice recommends short spells in the sun - without suncream and in the middle of the day.", "candidate": "Summer sun exposure is a \"safe balance\" between vitamin D levels and skin cancer risk, experts say.", "doc_id": 1200, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "\"What's changed is that we're now saying that exposure of 10 to 15 minutes to the UK summer sun, without suncream, several times a week is probably a safe balance between adequate vitamin D levels and any risk of skin cancer.\"", "explanation": "Agrees with the overall sentiment and statement that there's a safe balance between exposure and cancer with Vitamin D.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

{"article": "\"Fracking\" involves pumping water and chemicals into shale rock at pressure. The joint report from the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering say the technique is safe if firms follow best practice and rules are enforced. Exploratory fracking is being mooted in at least seven sites around the UK. The report was commissioned by the government's chief scientist, Sir John Beddington, following the decision last year to halt the UK's most advanced project, in Lancashire, after fracking caused small earth tremors. \"Our main conclusions are that the environmental risks of hydraulic fracturing for shale can can be safely managed provided there is best practice observed and provided it's enforced through strong regulation,\" said the report's chair, Prof Robert Mair from Cambridge University. \"The UK regulatory system is up to the job for the present very small scale exploration activities, but there would need to be strengthening of the regulators if the government decides to proceed with more shale gas extraction, particularly at the production stage,\" he told BBC News. The report contains 10 top-line recommendations for strengthening regulations, including: . Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, involves drilling down into shale formations and fracturing the rock using explosives or hydraulic pressure. Water is pumped in containing sand particles that prop open the cracks in the shale, allowing the gas out, and a tiny amount of chemicals. In the US, concerns have been raised that the gas or the chemicals can enter drinking water supplies. However, the report concludes that gas contamination should not be a problem - the risk is \"very low\" - provided that fracking takes place at a depth of many hundreds of metres, a long way below the level of aquifers, and that the wells are properly constructed. Each well is lined with layers of steel and cement; and if this stays intact, the scientists conclude, gas leakage should not be a problem. They also say that with good management of waste water, chemical contamination should be avoided; they criticise the US practice of leaving it in open ponds, which would not be permitted in the UK. The report says the risk that fracking will generate significant seismic events is also small. The actual explosions are far too small to be noticed at the surface, said Prof Zoe Shipton from the University of Strathclyde. \"If the fluid moves into existing faults in the rock that are close to slipping anyway, you'll bring that slippage forward in time,\" she said. \"But the Magnitude 2.3 event in Blackpool last year - that is like a lorry going past your house - in fact the British Geological Survey can't measure below Magnitude 2 in towns because of the traffic.\" The European industry is in its infancy compared with the US, and governments' views on the technology are mixed. Fracking has been banned in France, but countries such as Poland are taking a strong interest. UK ministers see shale gas as a way of cheaply bridging the transition to a low-carbon fuel mix, despite calculations showing that widespread adoption without carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology would mean future UK governments missing their legally-binding greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Prof Mair said climate impacts were outside his remit, but a detailed look at the issue should happen at some stage. \"The Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering believe this is an issue that needs to be addressed,\" he said. \"It's a very wide issue - energy policy, CO2 reduction, all of that needs to be looked at - and gas in general is part of that.\" Follow Richard . on Twitter .", "abstract": "A gas extraction method which triggered two earth tremors near Blackpool last year should not cause earthquakes or contaminate water but rules governing it will need tightening, experts say.", "candidate": "The environmental risks of fracking for shale gas in the UK are \"very low\", a report says.", "doc_id": 1209, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "However, the report concludes that gas contamination should not be a problem - the risk is \"very low\" - provided that fracking takes place at a depth of many hundreds of metres, a long way below the level of aquifers, and that the wells are properly constructed.", "explanation": "The summary accurately states what was said by a report about the risks of fracking in the UK.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

Some of Mr Trump's campaign rhetoric cast doubt over long-standing US alliances, including with Japan. The meeting was Mr Trump's first face-to-face with a world leader since winning the presidential election. The US and Japan have been key allies since the end of World War Two, when the US helped Japan rebuild its economy. The president-elect has vowed to scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which Mr Abe strenuously supports as a means of countering China's growing economic strength. The deal was approved by the Japanese parliament, despite the likelihood that it would be cancelled when Mr Trump takes office. Mr Trump has also said Japan needs to pay more to maintain US troops on its soil, and has floated the idea that Japan and South Korea should develop their own nuclear weapons to counter the threat from North Korean missiles. The meeting was reportedly arranged when Mr Abe rang the president-elect to congratulate him, mentioning that he would be passing through New York on the way to an Asia-Pacific trade summit in Peru. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Abe said: \"We were able to have a very candid talk over a substantial amount of time. We held it in a very warm atmosphere. \"I do believe that without confidence between the two nations the alliance would never function in the future and as the outcome of today's discussion I am convinced Mr Trump is a leader in whom I can have great confidence.\" The Japanese leader gave few details of the meeting but added the two agreed to meet again for deeper talks on a wider range of issues. Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, who have emerged as key advisers to Mr Trump since his surprise election victory, also met Mr Abe at Trump Tower.

The unconscious body of Pte Boyd, who served with the Royal Gibraltar Regiment, was found by police in the town in the early hours of 8 May. Pte Boyd, who is originally from Carrickfergus, County Antrim, had been in the town for training exercises at the infantry battle school. During the trial, the court heard Pte Boyd was making his way back to the barracks when he was attacked outside a bar called The Cellar. CCTV footage showed the soldier being punched, going to the ground and being beaten until he no longer moved. Vallely then dragged his body from the scene before fleeing.

{"article": "A proposed amendment to the Finance Bill by the SNP and Plaid Cymru, which would have prevented the increase, was defeated by a majority of 295. A Labour-backed amendment calling for the move to be delayed pending an assessment of its impact on vulnerable groups was also defeated. Ministers have said the tax rise is \"unavoidable\" to reduce the deficit. In a further vote, MPs approved the VAT rise by 321 to 246, a government majority of 75. The votes came during a lengthy debate on the bill, which enacts last month's Budget, in the Commons. Chancellor George Osborne has said the planned rise in the main rate of VAT from 17.5% to 20% is estimated to raise \u00c2\u00a313bn towards reducing the \u00c2\u00a3155bn deficit. The move was controversial as the Conservatives said they had \"no plans\" to raise it during the election while the Lib Dems attacked the Tories - now their now-coalition partners - saying their plans would necessitate a \"VAT bombshell\". But neither the Conservatives, Labour nor the Lib Dems ruled out raising VAT before the general election. MPs discussed a group of 16 opposition amendments - including a bid by the SNP to scrap the rise altogether and several Labour amendments, including one which would delay the VAT rise until the government has assessed its impact on pensioners, children and those on low fixed incomes. The SNP amendment was defeated by 316 votes to 21. Another Labour amendment, which was also defeated, would have exempted groups such as charities, local authorities and other groups from the VAT rise. A Lib Dem MP, Andrew George, tabled an amendment to peg the rise to just 0.5% - from 17.5% to 18%. \"Of all the measures to restore the public finances it seems to me that a VAT rise has to be among the least welcome of all of the alternatives,\" he told MPs.

And, given the circumstances we're in, any government would do it.\" He added: \"We had to raise VAT because there was no money left.\" But shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Liam Byrne said Britain's pensioners may face \"an \u00c2\u00a38bn VAT bill over the course of this Parliament\". In an interview with the BBC's Daily Politics earlier, shadow chancellor Alistair Darling confirmed Labour had looked at raising VAT to 18% or 19% and said he did \"not have a philosophic problem with that\" as long as \"you do something to help people on low fixed incomes\" like pensioners and to ease the effect of spending cuts.

{"article": "Ravindra Gaikwad said he \"hit him 25 times with my sandal\" for \"arrogance\" after failing to get a business class seat on an Air India flight. Air India, which filed a complaint on Thursday, said Mr Gaikwad was banned on all flights operated by the Federation of Indian Airlines (FIA). Members of the FIA include IndiGo, Go Air, Spice Jet and Jet Airways. All the airlines are dominant players in India's domestic aviation industry. In a statement, the FIA also called for \"strict action\" against Mr Gaikwad by law enforcement agencies. \"We believe that an assault on any one of our employees is an assault on all of us and on ordinary law-abiding citizens of our country who work hard to earn a living,\" the statement said. The Indian Commercial Pilots Association has also issued a statement, saying that it has asked its member pilots not to operate any flight on which Mr Gaikwad is a passenger. The MP had been told he could not fly business class on the Pune to Delhi flight because it was an all-economy flight, reports say. The altercation happened when the duty manager was called after the plane landed in Delhi and the MP refused to get off. The MP told the media: \"I am not a BJP MP. I am a Shiv Sena MP and will not tolerate any insult. Let the employee complain. I will complain to the Speaker and other authorities.\" On Friday he continued to insist that he would not apologise to the employee, identified as a 60-year-old man. The airline staff member told Asian News International that the MP had broken his glasses in the attack. \"When I told him what he was asking wasn't possible, he became abusive and started using foul language,\" he said. \"God save our country if this is the culture and behaviour of our MPs.\" The story was the top trending topic on Twitter in India on Thursday. Ashok Ganapathi Raju, the civil aviation minister, told reporters at parliament on Thursday: \"No citizen will behave like this. Physical assault won't be encouraged and will always be condemned.\" Last year an Indian MP was arrested for alleging slapping an airline official at an airport in Andhra Pradesh after being told he could not board a flight with his family after the gate had closed. The Shiv Sena party is a junior coalition partner in the Maharashtra state government, which is ruled by India's governing BJP. Over time, it has acquired a reputation for promoting religious and ethnic chauvinism, and has resorted to physical attacks against those its members and supporters oppose.

{"article": "After last year's test which focused on a collapse in house prices in the UK, this year's test will have a more international flavour. Under the scenario, global growth will fall, the Chinese economy slow markedly and the UK and the eurozone will face a new bout of recession with rising unemployment and falling property prices. In Britain, the economy will contract by 2.3%. As the Bank grapples with the new crisis, interest rates in the UK are cut to zero. And as the global economy slumps, the oil price collapses to $38 and deflation - causing companies to withdraw investment - \"increases the real burden of debt and increases market concerns\". The world would see the worst levels of deflation since the 1930s. Some major global banks and companies could default on debt repayments. To be clear, the Bank's five-year scenario does not mean it believes these events will happen. This is what is called a \"tail-risk\" event. It could happen but the probability is exceedingly low. But then again, no-one predicted the severity of the financial crisis. And actually this scenario is not as bad as what actually happened in 2008, even though it is put in place to try to stop those calamitous events ever occurring again. Six banks will have their balance sheets tested against this stress test - HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, Santander UK and Standard Chartered. The building society Nationwide will also be tested. Many believe that this will be a tougher test for banks with large international businesses - HSBC and Standard Chartered - than the UK domestic test of last year. Co-op Bank, a mainly UK bank, has been dropped from this year's test. \"Last year's stress test demonstrated how much stronger the core of the UK financial system has become since the financial crisis,\" said Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England. \"This year's test will have a different focus. \"By assessing the resilience of the UK banking system against a major external shock, we will improve further our ability to identify vulnerabilities and we will ensure that banks have plans in place to address a wider range of possible stresses. \"We are committed to ensuring our major banks are resilient [and] that they can weather shocks without calling on tax payer support.\" Under the scenario, banks will be obliged to continue lending to the UK economy, one of the biggest risks of a global turndown. The results of the tests, which bank officials believe are \"severe\", will be published in December. Banks might then be required to raise more capital to strengthened their balance sheets. One big missing piece of the stress test is a break up of the eurozone. That might seem odd, given events in Greece. But Bank officials explain that the eurozone is a more immediate issue and that the direct exposure of the UK banks to Greece is low at about \u00a32bn.

Echeverr\u00eda reportedly tried to fight off the terrorists with his skateboard to save a stabbed woman. He became one of eight victims of the assault on the London Bridge area. Earlier in the week, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy praised his \"heroic and exemplary act\" and recommended that he receive the award. The foreign ministry in Madrid said: \"His bravery in standing up for a defenceless person is a reminder of the need to remain united in the face of the scourge of terrorism.\" On Saturday night, Echeverr\u00eda, 39, was passing through Borough Market after an evening skateboarding with friends nearby. Guillermo S\u00e1nchez, a friend who was with him at the time, told El Pa\u00eds newspaper that they had been on their way to dinner when they saw a man on the street and assumed they had stumbled into a drunken brawl. They then saw a police officer fall to the ground and a woman being assaulted. \"I'm focusing on her and then, suddenly, I see that Ignacio's there, starting to hit [the attackers] with his skateboard,\" S\u00e1nchez told the paper. Shortly afterwards, Echeverr\u00eda was attacked himself and he was last seen lying on the ground, the family said. His friends managed to get away. His death was confirmed on Wednesday after his family had waited several days for information. On Thursday, Las Rozas, his hometown on the outskirts of Madrid, held a vigil in his honour, which was attended by thousands. El Pa\u00eds reported that a new skateboarding park will be named after him. \"My brother Ignacio tried to stop the terrorists and lost his life trying to save others,\" his sister Isabel said on social media. Echevarr\u00eda worked for the HSBC bank in London, as part of their team fighting money laundering. His body is due to arrive in Madrid on Saturday, said Spanish news agency EFE. The same Spanish state aircraft will also carry some of Echevarr\u00eda's relatives. The British ambassador to Spain, Simon Manley, and Spain's Deputy Foreign Minister, Crist\u00f3bal Gonz\u00e1lez-Aller, will meet the plane when it arrives. The three attackers were killed by police shortly after they began their assault.

Researchers said mortality could rise further as tobacco companies aggressively targeted new markets, especially in the developing world. The report was published in the medical journal The Lancet. \"Despite more than half a century of unequivocal evidence of the harmful effects of tobacco on health, today, one in every four men in the world is a daily smoker,\" said senior author Dr Emmanuela Gakidou. \"Smoking remains the second largest risk factor for early death and disability, and so to further reduce its impact we must intensify tobacco control to further reduce smoking prevalence and attributable burden.\" The Global Burden of Diseases report was based on smoking habits in 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2015. It found that nearly one billion people smoked daily in 2015 - one in four men and one in 20 women. That was a reduction from one in three men and one in 12 women who lit up in 1990. However, population growth meant there was an increase in the overall number of smokers, up from 870 million in 1990. And the number of tobacco-related deaths - more than 6.4 million in 2015 - increased by 4.7% over the same period. The study found some countries had succeeded in efforts to help people quit, mostly through a combination of higher taxes, warnings on packages and education programmes. Over the 25-year period, Brazil had seen the percentage of daily smokers drop from 29% to 12% among men and from 19% to 8% among women.

Sheriff Beckett's determination will be issued at 12:00 on Monday. The announcement, by the Judiciary of Scotland on Twitter, stated: \"Glasgow Bin Lorry FAI: Determination to be issued at 12 noon on Monday 7 December 2015.

The FAI examined Mr Clarke's health, the bin lorry vehicle and the route it took on the day of the crash. During evidence, it emerged that Mr Clarke was unconscious at the wheel of the Glasgow City Council bin lorry when it veered out of control on Queen Street. Just 19 seconds later, the vehicle came to rest against the Millennium Hotel in George Square, with six people dead and 15 injured. The FAI heard that Mr Clarke suffered an earlier blackout at the wheel of a stationary bus in 2010 and that this episode, and his history of dizziness and other ailments, were not disclosed to Glasgow City Council and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA). In his evidence, Mr Clarke refused to apologise and answer all questions put to him as it emerged he may face a private prosecution from some of the bereaved families. He was later suspended from his council job and resigned before he was due to face a disciplinary hearing. Mr Clarke later issued a statement to the BBC stating that he apologised \"unreservedly\" for his role in the tragedy.

Mr Jones met Mrs May in her visit to Swansea on Monday, during which she also signed the \u00c2\u00a31.3bn Swansea Bay Region city deal. Following the meeting, the first minister said the talks had been \"constructive\". \"It was made clear that Welsh interventions had helped change and strengthen the UK positions on transition arrangements and on workers' rights,\" Mr Jones said. He called for more \"partnership working\" in the vein of the city deal as Article 50 approaches. Mrs May said she wanted to get \"the best possible deal for the United Kingdom that works for everyone across the United Kingdom\".

{"article": "The Easter Road side have lost their last four league games and seen Falkirk open a six-point gap in second place. Boss Alan Stubbs has given his players some rest during the international break to renew their energy and focus. \"The boys are getting time off. The manager said, 'you'd better come back refreshed', and it was an order rather than anything else,\" said McGinn. The midfielder joins up with the Scotland squad on Friday ahead of the second of their two friendlies against Denmark on Tuesday, and welcomes the change in scene. He told BBC Scotland: \"It's good to get away. We've played a lot of games, and that isn't a complaint or an excuse, it's just that sometimes it's good to get away from it to recharge the batteries and that's what we'll be doing. \"A big reason for being up near the top of the table was keeping clean sheets and being very astute defensively. Now we're conceding poor goals and not scoring goals at the other end. \"It's a very confusing time for us, but we're determined to work as hard as we can. We're just not getting the breaks or producing the quality we did in the first half of the season and it's something we're trying to eradicate, and hopefully we will before the end of the season.\" Hibs have two games in hand on Falkirk, who lie in the promotion play-off spot, with Rangers a further 11 points clear at the top. But Falkirk could extend their advantage to nine points by beating Livingston on Saturday. \"It's close and that's fair play to Falkirk, and something we're disappointed by,\" McGinn noted. \"We're determined to get that second place and make sure we've got the best chance of going up. \"I'm not playing as well as I was just before Christmas. As a team, we're all not playing as we can and that's evident in the results that are coming for us. We're working hard to try to nail down what the problem is and I'm sure we'll get back to winning ways sometime soon.\" McGinn feels he has developed as a player since his move from St Mirren to Easter Road last summer, and credits Stubbs and the Hibs coaching staff for his improvement. As captain of the Scotland Under-21s, he was one of several young players who impressed Gordon Strachan when he spent time with the squad last November. The 21-year-old aims to use his time training with the squad ahead of the Denmark game at Hampden to show he can make the step up to full international level. \"It's a big step up and I'm really looking forward to showing I'm capable of making that step up,\" he added. \"That's something myself and some of the other new boys will be looking to do. \"The last trip with the 21s that Gordon was there, we knew from the stuff that Ricky [Sbragia] was telling us that he was really keen on how people conducted themselves about the place and in training. \"We knew that if we trained well, we'd have a chance and he'd have a look at us. It's something that I'll be looking to do this time again and hopefully perform as well as I did the last time. \"My first few initial games for Scotland [Under-21s] were difficult. I didn't adapt well, but the more I played the more I got used to the international style.

{"article": "Police officers are allowed to search people for items such as drugs, stolen goods and weapons. But there has been controversy over \"consensual searches\", where people are searched without any legal basis. If approved by parliament, the code will end consensual searches from May. Ministers asked an advisory group of experts to draft the code following a BBC Scotland investigation which revealed that hundreds of children under the age of 12 were being subjected to consensual stop searches. The new code states that stopping and searching members of the public is a \"significant intrusion into their personal liberty and privacy\". It must therefore be done for a good reason, and be both \"necessary and proportionate\", it says. This means that the officer must have a \"reasonable suspicion\" based on \"facts, information and/or intelligence\" that the person being searched is likely to be carrying an illegal item. But officers will not be allowed to search someone based purely on their appearance - for example age, race or gender - or because they have previous convictions. The codes states: \"A stop and search will not be carried out in a manner which is abusive, discriminatory, or which amounts to harassment or intimidation.\" The person being searched must understand why it is being carried out, with the officer also required to carry it out \"with respect for individual needs - including religious and cultural values and beliefs.\" And officers must be \"fully accountable\" for the searches they carry out, with all stop and searches accurately recorded, and open to scrutiny. The code also sets out specific guidelines for dealing with children and vulnerable adults, and acknowledges that that they may require additional support to help them comprehend and participate in the search process. It says: \"In taking a decision to search a child or a young person, a constable must treat the need to safeguard and promote the well-being of that child or young person as a primary consideration. \"Where a constable believes it to be more harmful to a child or young person to carry out a search than not, then the search should not proceed and other measures to safeguard them should be considered.\" It also says that officers should use \"age-appropriate terms\" when speaking with children and young people and avoid the use of technical or legal language, unless required to do so by law. The Scottish government announced on 4 November 2016 that there is not enough evidence to support creating a police power to search children for alcohol at this time. The situation will be re-assessed after the code has been in force for 12 months . A code of practice underpinning the use of stop and search is required under The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2016. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said stop and search was a valuable tool for combating crime, but that it was important to strike a balance between protecting the public and recognising people's human rights. He said: \"This new code is about finding that balance and maintaining the trust between the police and the public. \"With this new code we will ensure stop and search is carried out with the fairness, integrity, respect and accountability that we expect from our police officers in all of their duties.\" Research published by Edinburgh University in 2014 showed police in Scotland were far more likely to carry out stop and searches than their colleagues in England and Wales. The figures also suggested that young people were the most likely to be searched. But the number of stop-and-searches has fallen dramatically since then, with 888 consensual searches and 20,665 statutory searches conducted between 1 April and 30 September last year. This compared with 450,173 consensual searches and 192,470 statutory searches in 2013/14. Assistant Chief Constable Mark Williams said Police Scotland had made \"real progress\" on the issue, and \"very much welcomed\" the new guidelines. He added: \"We are currently training all our officers in advance of its introduction to ensure we are fully prepared.\"", "abstract": "Police officers will only be able to stop and search people when they have \"reasonable grounds\" to do so under new rules published by the Scottish government.", "candidate": "A new code of conduct for police in Scotland has been published.", "doc_id": 1255, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "The new code states that stopping and searching members of the public is a \"significant intrusion into their personal liberty and privacy\".", "explanation": "The summary accurately states the location and status of the code of conduct referenced.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

We drove past busy street markets, people loaded on their bikes or walking with their shopping. This is a country used to disaster. It looked like the Haitians of Port-au-Prince were determined to carry on. We only began to see the real destructive force of Hurricane Matthew once we moved towards the south-west of the country. Trees fallen, banana crops uprooted and flattened, houses under water and men and women trying to get the debris out of the way. It was noticeable how the people we passed were coping alone. There were no army or police around to help. Even the aid agencies are struggling to move around this damaged corner of the country.

Jolie, 36, who was at the 17th Sarajevo Film Festival with boyfriend Brad Pitt, visited Bosnia several times last year as a goodwill ambassador for the UN's refugee agency. She said she was \"so honoured to be here\". \"There is no greater example of the strengths of the artists and the festival that began during the war and grew stronger every year,\" she added. The festival began as an act of resistance in 1995 with residents braving mortar shells to gather in a basement to watch Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. Some scenes from Jolie's film In the Land of Blood and Honey - due for release in December - were shot in Bosnia while others were shot in Hungary. The film, which stars Zana Marjanovic and Rade Serbedzija, tells the story of a love affair between a Bosnian Muslim woman and a Serb, on opposite sides of the conflict. The licence to film in Sarajevo was at one point revoked following local rumours that the film featured a rape victim who falls in love with her assailant. The licence was given back when producers proved the rumour was not true. At the time, Jolie asked people to \"hold judgement until they have seen the film\". \"There are many twists in the plot that address the sensitive nature of the relationship between the main characters and that will be revealed once the film is released,\" she said.

I'd be really disappointed if they don't,\" said Proms director David Pickard. He went on to praise the musician's \"wonderful, varied\" scores. However Williams will not be able to attend the concert, as his age prevents him from taking trans-Atlantic flights. This was a contributing factor in the London Symphony Orchestra losing the opportunity to land the next generation of Star Wars films. The John Williams tribute is one of almost concerts that will take place as part of the 123rd Proms this summer. To mark Hull's year as the City of Culture, the festival will leave London for the first time since the 1930s with a performance of Handel's Water Music at a new outdoor ampitheatre overlooking the River Hull and the Humber estuary. Back in London, Europe's only BAME orchestra, Chineke!, will make their Proms debut. The brainchild of double-bassist Chi-chi Nwanoku, the ensemble was only founded in 2015, making it one of the youngest groups ever to play the festival. \"It would normally be common for an orchestra to be in existence for five or six years before they appear,\" said Pickard. But he said it was \"very important to mark\" the \"significance of Chineke! and what they are doing,\" in showcasing the talent of under-represented performers. The orchestra will debut a new work by British-Caribbean composer Hannah Kendall, The Spark Catchers, accompanied by BBC Young Musician winner Sheku Kanneh-Mason - who will receive his A-Level results shortly before the concert, on 30 August.

Notably, the 2017 season has nothing as populist as last year's Strictly Prom, or previous years' diversions into grime and dance music. \"I don't want the Proms to be something that repeats things for the sake of repeating them,\" said Pickard, adding he wanted to \"find new ways of getting new audiences\". \"And things like the John Williams prom will hopefully do the same thing that a Doctor Who Prom might do, which is to bring in an audience that might be drawn in by the films they've seen, but will hear music they love played by an orchestra.\" 2017 marks 90 years since the BBC took over running and financing the Proms, and 70 years since the famous Last Night was broadcast on television. It has commissioned 30 new works, 13 of which are by female composers, while three female conductors will make their first Proms appearance. Although he admitted there was still work to be done, Pickard said the diversity of this year's performers and composers wouldn't have been possible 10 years ago. \"The Proms is a leader in classical music and people look to us for the things we're doing,\" he said. \"And whilst we can't bear that responsibility alone, I think it's incredibly important we take the lead.\" All of this year's concerts will be broadcast on BBC Radio 3, and more than 20 will be filmed for television or iPlayer.

It now plans to restart glass bottling at its Moodiesburn base. The plastic bottling capacity at its new Milton Keynes plant will also be extended. AG Barr said it had held its share of a soft drinks market that faced falling retail prices in the first half of last year. It cited industry figures showing the soft drinks market rising 1.2% by value in the past year and 1.6% in volume. This masked volatility over the year and between sub-sectors. It faced rising costs in the second half of the year, resulting from the weaker pound affecting input prices. Sales of Irn Bru were up 3.2% by value in the year to 31 January. Sales of Rubicon, the tropical fruit drinks, were up 4.9%. Funkin, the cocktail mixer brand which AG Barr bought recently, was up 27%. There was a tougher time for Strathmore bottled water. While the carbonated drinks market saw no increase in volume, there was a slight rise in the value. The reverse was true of non-fizzy drinks, with still water being the main driver of sales volume. AG Barr has set a target, by this autumn, of 90% of brands having low or no sugar content. It claimed this was in response to consumer demand.

JDS says analysis of the photographs' metadata shows they were taken by the same camera at 10:14 and 12:01 on 19 May 2009 - on the final day of Sri Lankan forces' bitter 26-year war against the Tigers.

{"article": "Mohammad Thneibat said countries such as Jordan faced a \"serious problem\" in coping with so many young refugees. He called for more international financial support to help build schools and train teachers. \"The alternatives are very bad,\" said Mr Thneibat. \"The international community will pay a high price if we don't stand together to face this serious problem,\" he told the Global Education and Skills Forum. Mr Thneibat said Jordan already had Palestinian and Iraqi refugees and now had 1.3 million Syrians who had fled across its borders. \"We're trying to do everything to educate these young people for peace, introducing ideas of tolerance and co-existence,\" Mr Thneibat, who is also Jordan's education minister, told the international conference in Dubai. But he warned that Syria's neighbours did not have the capacity to deal with such an influx of families without more international assistance. He said Jordan was training thousands more teachers and building new schools, which would operate in double shifts to try to accommodate 145,000 refugee children in its state school system. But there were still more children arriving than could be taught, he warned. There had been financial support from the international community - and more had been pledged, Mr Thneibat said - but almost two-thirds of the cost of each extra refugee pupil was being taken from Jordan's own education budget, he said. This was in addition to extra costs in health, housing and infrastructure. Without any access to education, he said such youngsters could become part of another cycle of conflict. \"If we leave these students, we believe they could become extremists.\" Tom Fletcher, UK ambassador to Lebanon until last year, said the numbers of refugees were now \"staggering\". Mr Fletcher is now working for a coalition trying to get business support to tackle the refugee crisis.

It looks certain Whittingham will commit his future to the Bluebirds by signing a new contract. \"We'll talk about that before the FA Cup probably,\" said Warnock. Cardiff face Fulham in the third round of the FA Cup on Sunday, 8 December, but before that, on Monday 2 January, the Bluebirds entertain Whittingham's former club, Aston Villa in the Championship. Back in 2007, then-Cardiff boss Dave Jones, bought Whittingham from Villa for a fee of \u00a3350,000. Since then, the dead-ball specialist has established himself as one of the most popular players ever to pull on a Cardiff shirt. He has been named in the Championship Team of the Season three times and, in 2015, he was included in the Football League Team of the Decade. Whittingham also finished joint-top scorer in the Championship in the 2009-10 campaign having found the net 20 times in the league for the Bluebirds. During his time with Cardiff, Whittingham has turned down the chance of a move away from the Welsh club.

{"article": "The Premier League got under way this weekend, with many teams showing off their new signings, but who impressed and who had a debut to forget? From scoring a wonder goal to being booked after barely a minute on the pitch, BBC Sport takes a look at how some of those making their top-flight bow got on. Dimitri Payet, signed by West Ham from Marseille in the summer, created more chances than any other player in Europe's top five leagues last season and he certainly added a creative edge to the Hammers' attack in Sunday's shock 2-0 win at Arsenal. The 28-year-old took the free-kick that caught out Petr Cech and allowed Cheikhou Kouyate to head home the opener, and was a lively presence throughout. Newcastle's signing of Dutch midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum from PSV was certainly one of the more impressive captures of the summer, and the 24-year-old made a strong impression on his Premier League debut. Wijnaldum headed Newcastle ahead against Southampton on Sunday, but the hosts could not hold on as the Saints fought back to earn a 2-2 draw. There were plenty of reasons to be impressed with Swansea's performance as they held defending champions Chelsea to a 2-2 draw, and Andre Ayew was one of them. The Ghana forward showed cat-like instincts to pull a rebound from a Thibaut Courtois save to catch out John Terry, before calmly steering the ball home for one the opening weekend's best goals. The same could not be said for Andre's younger brother, however. Jordan Ayew started for Aston Villa at Premier League new boys Bournemouth, but the former Lorient striker failed to make an impression and was substituted on the hour. His replacement, Rudy Gestede, instead caught the eye as he grabbed the Villa winner. With fellow debutant Wijnaldum impressing, Aleksander Mitrovic was evidently keen to make an impression when he climbed off the bench in the 75th minute. Sadly, it was not the kind of impression he would have liked as, less than a minute after coming on, he was booked for a foul on Matt Targett. Youthful naivety from the 20-year-old. Exciting, fast and skilful. Memphis Depay certainly looked like a signing that will get Manchester United fans on their feet, but what his Premier League debut performance lacked was a goal threat. The 21-year-old Netherlands winger had a couple of half chances, but never really looked like troubling Michel Vorm in the Tottenham goal during Saturday's 1-0 win for Louis van Gaal's side.", "abstract": "New season, new faces.", "candidate": "It has been another busy summer in the transfer market.", "doc_id": 1278, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "It has been another busy summer in the Premier League signing market.", "evidence": "The Premier League got under way this weekend, with many teams showing off their new signings, but who impressed and who had a debut to forget?", "explanation": "The summary is vague and does not specify the sport or league involved.

{"article": "Reactions range from the \"BBC has killed Top Gear\", to praise for a \"brave BBC\". The story was also news for media in areas as far apart as Latin America and Europe, with the Russian Defence Ministry even offering Clarkson a job at its own TV station. French daily Figaro said the announcement had had \"the effect of a bomb on Twitter\". It added that \"the sense of disappointment can be read in messages posted on the social network across the Channel and even in France\". Italian journalist Federico Garimberti recalled on Twitter: \"Like it or not, a BBC that shows Clarkson the door demonstrates that it doesn't give a damn about its audience. Top Gear is watched by 350 million people in 212 countries.\" \"This is the end of Top Gear as we know it,\" Jan Micka exclaimed on the Czech website Auto.cz. In Iran, a disappointed Twitter user tried to start a trend in defence of the British TV presenter. \"We are all Jeremy Clarkson,\" declared @CmpiChism, arguing that \"no one can present like him\". Other Iranians seemed to agree. Saman Vatanshenasan wrote on Facebook that it was \"meaningless to imagine the Top Gear without Jeremy... I need to say this in support of him that I am Jeremy Clarkson\". \"Now that the BBC has sacked Clarkson does anyone watch Top Gear anymore? They are crazy,\" @sellar said on Twitter. But not everyone in Iran on social media was pro-Clarkson. Facebook user Mohammad E. Amini pointed out that it was \"important to know the red line between fame and extremism\". \"BBC saved its name by making this decision,\" he added. \"BBC decision to stop its cooperation with Clarkson was a very brave and respectable move. Even if you have 30 million viewers there is still no reason for assault,\" argued @jaavid on Twitter. In the Czech Republic, the move to drop the Top Gear presenter was welcomed by journalist Ivan Kytka. \"For the BBC, principles are clearly more important than profit. Money is not the most important thing for a public service broadcaster,\" he said on the Czech TV website. The BBC's decision not to renew Clarkson's contract was greeted with approval by internet users in Argentina. Last September, the Top Gear crew had to abandon filming in the country amid angry protests over a car number plate that appeared to refer to the Falklands War. \"Thanks Jeremy\u2026 we don't need you around here\u2026 when you do come back it'll be to cover the story of when your delinquent countrymen give back the Malvinas [Falklands],\" said a reader in the online forum of Clarin newspaper. \"The best TV channel in the world can't have this type of employee,\" was another opinion in the same forum. Many social media users were amused the BBC's announcement coincided with news of singer Zayn Malik leaving the successful British boy band One Direction. \"Jeremy Clarkson and Zayn Malik could team up to form a new boy band - Top Direction,\" \u200f@sicfallacy suggested on Twitter. But for Italian user Mauro Scarpoloni, Clarkson was obviously the more popular brand. \"So the real drama is not One Direction, it's that the BBC has killed @BBC_TopGear #BringBackClarkson,\" he tweeted. In Russia, the story seemed to acquire a political dimension. Interfax news agency quoted St Petersburg councillor Vitaliy Milonov as saying: \"Clarkson will be able to find a great job in our country, where he will not be told how to host a TV programme.\" Zvezda, the TV channel controlled by the Russian Defence Ministry, announced on its website that it had officially offered to employ the former Top Gear presenter. It published a letter to Clarkson in English: . \"Dear Jeremy, the Russian Armed Forces Broadcasting Company 'Zvezda' expresses deep honour to you and kindly asks for cooperation. \"We would like to invite you to be a presenter of motoring show on our TV Channel in Moscow.\" BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

{"article": "Four constituents raised the action under the Representation of the People Act 1983. They argued he misled the electorate over a memo claiming SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon would rather have seen David Cameron become prime minister. Judges have ruled that there will now be a \"By Order hearing\" to discuss the next part of the case. Lady Paton and Lord Matthews had heard a preliminary legal debate at a special Election Court, which examined three questions. The first was whether section 106 of the act - which makes it illegal to make or publish false statements about any candidate during an election campaign - could apply to candidates talking about themselves, as well as attacks on their rivals. The judges have ruled that the language used in section 106 was \"wide enough to encompass a statement made by a candidate about himself\". However, they said they wanted to hear evidence about the two remaining issues before issuing a determination on the case. These are whether the words were false statements of fact which related to Mr Carmichael's personal character or conduct, and whether they were said \"for the purpose of affecting the return of any candidate at the election\". The judges said they wanted to hear evidence on these issues because each case had to be considered on its own facts. Lady Paton said: \"Circumstances can be envisaged where a false statement of fact is of such a nature that the effect in relation to a candidate's personal character or conduct transcends the political context. \"The question of the type of relationship between the statement and the personal character and conduct of the first respondent is one which requires evidence, including evidence as to the motive or reason for giving the false statement.\" Mr Carmichael's QC had asked the judges to dismiss the case, on the grounds it was \"irrelevant\" and \"bound to fail\". Legal argument was heard at a special election court in Edinburgh earlier this month, which was broadcast and streamed online live. The case is believed to be the first of its kind in Scotland for 50 years. It arose from a story in the Daily Telegraph at the start of the general election campaign in April. Mr Carmichael - Scottish Secretary in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition before the election - had authorised the leaking of a civil service memo suggesting First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had told the French ambassador she wanted David Cameron to remain in Downing Street. He claimed in a TV interview the first he had heard of it was when he received a phone call from a journalist. However, the MP later admitted full responsibility for sanctioning its release, and accepted the \"details of the account are not correct\".

{"article": "The 11-month-old is on life support at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH). Charlie has an exceptionally rare genetic condition called encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS). Although he appeared perfectly healthy when he was born, his health soon began to deteriorate. Charlie now has severe brain damage. He cannot open his eyes or move his arms or legs. His condition also means he is unable to breathe unaided, which is why he needs to be on a ventilator. Charlie's heart, liver and kidneys are also affected, and his doctors say it is not clear if he feels pain. Charlie's parents, Connie Yates and Chris Gard, from Bedfont in west London, want Charlie to have an experimental treatment called nucleoside therapy. A hospital in the US has agreed to offer Charlie the treatment, and Charlie's parents have raised funds to take him there. But Charlie's doctors at GOSH do not think this is the right care for Charlie. They say they have explored various treatment options, including nucleoside drug therapy, and none would improve Charlie's quality of life. They say Charlie's life support should be switched off and he should be allowed to die. Charlie's doctors say his brain is extensively damaged at a cellular level. They say the US clinician offering the experimental treatment agrees it will not reverse this brain damage. GOSH applied to the High Court for judges to decide Charlie's future. The High Court agreed with the GOSH doctors. Charlie's parents then appealed against the decision, but courts ruled that the original decision should stand and that it would be in Charlie's best interests to be allowed to die with dignity. GOSH says it has applied to the High Court for a fresh hearing \"in light of claims of new evidence\" relating to potential treatment for Charlie's condition. Two international hospitals and their researchers have been in touch with GOSH with more information about nucleoside therapy - drugs designed to help treat MDDS. Meanwhile, the Pope and US President Donald Trump have offered to intervene and support Charlie's parents' plea. End of Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump . The president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, however, says such interventions from high-profile figures, no matter how well-intended, are \"unhelpful\". Charlie's doctors say their view has not changed - they still think the experimental treatment would be unjustified. But they believe it is right to seek the High Court's view again. The therapy is a treatment, not a cure. And it is highly experimental. It has been used on some patients, but none with Charlie's type of MDDS. There haven't yet been any trials in mice to see if it would work in Charlie's condition, which is caused by a mutation of a gene called RRM2B. The faulty DNA means Charlie's cells can't easily make energy to power his muscles and brain. Doctors say it doesn't look as though there will be time to run such tests before reaching a decision about Charlie's care. GOSH did apply for ethical permission to attempt nucleoside therapy on Charlie. By the time that decision was made, however, Charlie's condition had greatly worsened and the view was that his brain damage was too severe and irreversible for the treatment to help. Prof Julian Savulescu, an independent ethics expert at the University of Oxford, said: \"More than six months have passed since experimental therapy was first considered. We don't know how bad Charlie's brain damage is now. Whether experimental therapy is still warranted depends on whether there remains any prospect of any meaningful life.\" The High Court is now being asked to judge the evidence on this crucial point.", "abstract": "Doctors have asked the High Court to hear new evidence in the case of terminally ill Charlie Gard.", "candidate": "Charlie Gard is a baby who has been at the centre of a legal battle between his parents and his doctors.", "doc_id": 1288, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "But Charlie's doctors at GOSH do not think this is the right care for Charlie.", "explanation": "The summary accurately names the baby and states the status of the relationship between his parents and doctors.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}
{"article": "It was a ruling in a case brought by two women who wanted to wear the niqab veil, which covers all but the eyes. Belgium banned the wearing of partial or total face veils in public in 2011. The court agreed that the ban sought to guarantee the concept of \"living together\" and the \"protection of the rights and freedoms of others\". The court came to a similar judgement on Tuesday in the case of a Belgian woman who was contesting a bylaw brought in by three Belgian municipalities in 2008 that also banned face veils. The European Court of Human Rights is an international court set up in 1959 and rules on individual or state applications alleging violations of the civil and political rights set out in the European Convention on Human Rights. Belgian MPs approved the ban in 2011 on the grounds of security, to allow police to identify people, although some also argued the veil was a symbol of the oppression of women. The latest case brought against Belgium was filed by Belgian national Samia Belcacemi, who lives in Schaerbeek, and Moroccan national Yamina Oussar, who lives in Li\u00c3\u00a8ge. Ms Belcacemi removed her veil fearing she might be fined or jailed, while Ms Oussar opted to stay at home, curtailing her social life, the court noted. In its ruling, the court took into consideration a previous ruling it had made in a similar case brought against France over its imposition of a veil ban. It noted: \"The court found that the concern to ensure respect for the minimum guarantees of life in society could be regarded as an element of the 'protection of the rights and freedoms of others' and that the ban was justifiable in principle, solely to the extent that it sought to guarantee the conditions of 'living together'.\" In the second case, the court made a similar ruling against the application brought by Belgian national Fouzia Dakir against the ban imposed by the municipalities of Pepinster, Dison and Verviers in 2008. An appeal against the rulings can be lodged with the Grand Chamber of the court within three months. In March, Europe's top court, the European Court of Justice (ECJ), ruled that workplace bans on the wearing of \"any political, philosophical or religious sign\" such as headscarves need not constitute direct discrimination.

{"article": "The US and UK have announced new carry-on restrictions banning laptops on certain passenger flights. The so-called Islamic State group (IS) has been working on ways to smuggle explosives on to planes by hiding them in electronics, US sources tell ABC. The tip-off was judged by the US to be \"substantiated\" and \"credible\". Inbound flights on nine airlines operating out of 10 airports in eight countries are subject to the US Department of Homeland Security ban. Phones and medical devices are not affected. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is hosting a two-day meeting of ministers and senior officials from 68 nations to discuss the threat from IS. The Washington talks will be the first full meeting of the coalition since December 2014. The BBC's Barbara Plett-Usher looks ahead to the Washington meeting: . This will be a chance for the Trump administration to put its stamp on the global battle against the Islamic State group, and for the reticent secretary of state to put his stamp on a foreign policy issue that the president has identified as a priority. The State Department says the meeting aims to accelerate efforts to defeat IS in its remaining strongholds: the Iraqi city of Mosul and the Syrian city of Raqqa. On the campaign trail Mr Trump claimed to have a secret plan to obliterate the group. But his Pentagon has largely stuck with Barack Obama's strategy of supporting local ground forces, albeit with increased US military participation as the assault on Raqqa nears. Coalition members will also discuss how to stabilise and govern the cities after the conflict; and they're looking to see if Washington remains committed to a longer term effort to secure the region. Eric Swalwell, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, told ABC News there was \"a new aviation threat\". \"We know that our adversaries, terrorist groups in the United States and outside the United States, seek to bring down a US-bound airliner. That's one of their highest value targets. And we're doing everything we can right now to prevent that from happening.\" Another member of that committee, Republican Peter King, told the New York Times he was forewarned about the ban. \"It was based on intelligence reports that are fairly recent. Intelligence of something possibly planned.\" The restriction is based, we are told, on \"evaluated intelligence\", BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner writes. That means that US intelligence has either intercepted discussion of a possible extremist plot or has been passed word of one by a human informant. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning . The nine airlines covered by the US ban are Royal Jordanian, EgyptAir, Turkish Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Kuwait Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad Airways. The British ban, announced hours after the American measure, is similar but applies to different airlines, including British Airways and EasyJet. It covers direct passenger flights to the UK from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia. The 10 airports affected by the US ban are: . The airlines included in the US decision have been given a deadline of 07:00 GMT on Saturday to impose the ban, officials said, adding that the restriction had no end date. However, an Emirates spokeswoman told Reuters news agency the airline understood that the US directive would come into effect on 25 March and remain valid until 14 October 2017.

{"article": "German Chancellor Angela Merkel said negotiations would be \"complicated\" but the direction was clear. The proposed deal would see all migrants travelling to Greece from Turkey sent back. In return the EU might offer Turkey incentives, including financial aid and visa-free access to Schengen countries. The aim is to establish a joint position of all 28 EU member states before talks with the Turkish prime minister on Friday. But Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite warned that the plan to return people to Turkey was \"on the edge of international law\" and difficult to implement. And Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel said he could not accept negotiations that looked like blackmail. Since January 2015, a million migrants and refugees have entered the EU by boat from Turkey to Greece. More than 132,000 have arrived this year alone. Tens of thousands are now stuck in Greece as their route north has been blocked. \"Germany will negotiate intensively because we have to improve the humanitarian situation in Greece,\" Mrs Merkel said. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said if a deal could be reached the influx of migrants from Turkey to the Greek islands could be stopped \"in three to four weeks\". Under initial proposals, for each Syrian migrant returned to Turkey, a different Syrian would be resettled in the EU directly from the country. In return, the EU would double financial aid to Turkey promised last year, make a fresh push on talks over Turkey's eventual membership of the EU and offer visa-free travel to Europe's Schengen states. However, those proposals have since been watered down, lowering expectation on greater financial help and talks on EU membership and linking visa-free travel to 72 conditions to which Turkey must agree. EU member Cyprus has threatened to veto a deal. The Greek Cypriot government is not recognised by Turkey. The Spanish foreign minister has said Spain will oppose the \"blanket return\" of refugees to Turkey. Stressing what he called the UK's special status in the EU, Prime Minister David Cameron said he would not be offering visa-free access to Turkey. What mattered was \"busting the business model of the people smugglers\". A number of EU countries have raised concerns about what is on offer to Turkey amid a clampdown by the Ankara government on academics and journalists. German magazine Der Spiegel said on Thursday it had withdrawn its Istanbul correspondent, Hasnain Kazim, after the authorities refused to renew his press accreditation. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said the talks with Turkey would not just focus on migration. \"We have the internal situation in Turkey we are working on, being it the human rights and the rule of law issues, being it the necessary process with the Kurds to reopen spaces for peace,\" she said. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.", "abstract": "EU leaders trying to finalise a deal with Turkey on the migrant crisis have warned of the difficulties they face at the start of a summit in Brussels.", "candidate": "EU leaders have said they are determined to reach a deal with Turkey to ease the migrant crisis.", "doc_id": 1309, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "\"Germany will negotiate intensively because we have to improve the humanitarian situation in Greece,\" Mrs Merkel said.", "explanation": "The summary accurately reflects the position of EU leaders and correctly names the crisis situation.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}
{"article": "In a telephone call, US Secretary of State John Kerry told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi the US had \"strong concerns\" over recent developments. Last week, Chinese and Vietnamese ships clashed over the drilling rig that China has placed in waters near the disputed Paracel Islands. China and Manila are also at odds over overlapping territorial claims. Beijing claims a U-shaped swathe of the South China Sea that covers areas other South East Asian nations say are their territory. The issue has been rumbling in recent years amid an increasingly assertive stance from China over its claims. Last week, several collisions were reported between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels in disputed waters as the Vietnamese ships sought to prevent the installation of the Chinese drilling rig. Reports suggest the stand-off - involving dozens of ships - is continuing, with water cannon fire being exchanged. On Sunday, anti-China protests took place in several Vietnamese cities. It is the most serious confrontation between the two nations for several years. In Monday's telephone call, Mr Kerry \"said China's introduction of an oil rig and numerous government vessels in waters disputed with Vietnam was provocative\", US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. \"He urged both sides to de-escalate tensions, ensure safe conduct by their vessels at sea, and resolve the dispute through peaceful means in accordance with international law.\" Separately, in comments made at a meeting with the Singaporean foreign minister, Mr Kerry called the Chinese move an \"aggressive act\". Mr Wang, meanwhile, urged Mr Kerry to be objective on the issue, a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said. Tensions between Beijing and Manila are also running high, after the Philippines arrested and then charged nine Chinese fishermen with poaching at a disputed shoal. The Philippines is in the process of taking China to a UN court over its territorial claims. It has also recently signed a new security deal with the US which would allow an expanded US troop presence, in a move seen as linked to Manila's deteriorating ties with Beijing. On Tuesday, Chinese state media slammed the Philippines, saying that if it continued to challenge China it would pay \"an unaffordable price\".", "abstract": "The US has warned China that moving a drilling rig into seas disputed with Vietnam was \"provocative\".", "candidate": "The US has urged China and Vietnam to de-escalate tensions in the South China Sea.", "doc_id": 1311, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "In a telephone call, US Secretary of State John Kerry told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi the US had \"strong concerns\" over recent developments", "explanation": "it correctly pulls the info (lower tension, US, China, Viet Nam, south China Sea) from the source text", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

{"article": "Mr Straw introduced the act in 2000 but his place on a panel examining its work has been criticised by campaigners. The ex-Labour MP has said inquiries about ministerial communications and the formulation of government policy should not be allowed any more. But he told the BBC the review would weigh the evidence carefully including that from groups opposed to the act. The review was launched by the Cabinet Office amid concerns within government that \"sensitive information\" was not being protected. The Campaign for Freedom of Information, however, says the panel does not include any advocates for transparency. It suggests changes will see more requests being refused, resulting in \"bad decisions and policy mistakes\" concealed. The five-member committee also includes former Conservative Home Secretary Michael Howard, some of whose decisions in government were disclosed using the act. It will be headed by Lord Burns, the most senior civil servant in the Treasury between 1991 and 1998. The other members are Lib Dem peer Lord Carlile, the former Independent Reviewer of terrorism legislation, and Dame Patricia Hodgson, chair of the broadcasting regulator Ofcom. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the director of the Campaign for the Freedom of Information, Maurice Frankel, said the panel's composition \"was not the basis for an independent review\". Mr Frankel added: \"Jack Straw has already made his views [clear] on all the issues - he's in favour of restricting the act to make it impossible to obtain policy advice or internal discussions, he's in favour of introducing charges for information and making it harder for people to obtain information.\" Mr Straw said some critics of the commission would complain even it were \"chaired by the Archangel Gabriel\". \"I think that it's right to review the operation of the act,\" he said. \"Of course, the Freedom of Information Campaign would criticise any review.... but I go into this inquiry to be as open-minded as possible and to weigh the evidence carefully including that from the Freedom of Information Campaign.\" A Labour source said Mr Straw was acting in a personal capacity on the commission and was not representing the party. The source said: \"If the government were genuinely interested in improving the workings of the act, it should have chosen a more balanced panel.\" A Labour Party spokesman said: \"The commission's terms of reference clearly invite a change in the terms of the act. Our freedom of information laws are a crucial check on the power of the executive and the government should not attempt to restrict them by the back door.\" The passing of the act gave anyone the right to access recorded information held by government and other public sector bodies. It obliged public authorities in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and UK-wide authorities based in Scotland, to publish certain information about their activities.

{"article": "The test investigates whether people can detect if they are talking to machines or humans. The experiment is based on Alan Turing's question-and-answer game Can Machines Think? No computer has passed the test before under these conditions, it is reported. However, some artificial intelligence experts have disputed the victory, suggesting the contest had been weighted in the chatbot's favour. The 65-year-old Turing Test is successfully passed if a computer is mistaken for a human more than 30% of the time during a series of five-minute keyboard conversations. On 7 June Eugene convinced 33% of the judges at the Royal Society in London that it was human. Other artificial intelligence (AI) systems also competed, including Cleverbot, Elbot and Ultra Hal. Judges included actor Robert Llewellyn, who played an intelligent robot in BBC Two's science-fiction sitcom Red Dwarf, and Lord Sharkey, who led the successful campaign for Alan Turing's posthumous pardon, over a conviction for homosexual activity, in 2013. Eugene was created by Vladimir Veselov, who was born in Russia and now lives in the United States, and Ukrainian-born Eugene Demchenko, who now lives in Russia. Transcripts of the conversations are currently unavailable, but may appear in a future academic paper. The judges and hidden human control groups were kept apart throughout the test. The event was organised by Reading University's School of Systems Engineering in partnership with RoboLaw, an EU-funded organisation examining the regulation of emerging robotic technologies. Alan Turing was an English mathematician, wartime code-breaker and pioneer of computer science. The event has been labelled as \"historic\" by the organisers, who claim no computer has passed the test before. \"Some will claim that the Test has already been passed,\" said Kevin Warwick, a visiting professor at the University of Reading and deputy vice-chancellor for research at Coventry University. \"The words Turing test have been applied to similar competitions around the world. However, this event involved the most simultaneous comparison tests than ever before, was independently verified and, crucially, the conversations were unrestricted. \"A true Turing test does not set the questions or topics prior to the conversations. We are therefore proud to declare that Alan Turing's test was passed for the first time on Saturday.\" Prof Noel Sharkey, a leading expert in robotic technology and artificial intelligence, said: \"It is indeed a great achievement for Eugene. It was very clever ruse to pretend to be a 13-year-old Ukranian boy, which would constrain the conversation. But these competitions are really great to push developments.\" But others have criticised the claim. \"It's nonsense,\" Prof Stevan Harnad told the Guardian newspaper. \"We have not passed the Turing test. We are not even close.\" Hugh Loebner, creator of another Turing Test competition, has also criticised the University of Reading's experiment for only lasting five minutes. \"That's scarcely very penetrating,\" he told the Huffington Post, noting that Eugene had previously been ranked behind seven other systems in his own 25-minute long Loebner Prize test.", "abstract": "A computer program called Eugene Goostman, which simulates a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy, is said to have passed the Turing test at an event organised by the University of Reading.", "candidate": "Eugene, an artificial intelligence chatbot, has passed the Turing Test.", "doc_id": 1318, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "Eugene, an artificial intelligence chatbot, has potentially passed the Turing Test.", "evidence": "On 7 June Eugene convinced 33% of the judges at the Royal Society in London that it was human.", "explanation": "The problem here is that 30% must be fooled for it to pass, and Eugene fooled 33%, but it was not officially labelled as passing the test so while it potentially passed it, it wasn't official.", "instruction": "Remove the information about it passing the turing test from the summary.

Dyfed-Powys Commissioner Christopher Salmon has urged ministers to take rural needs into account when changing the police funding formula.

Mr Polin sent an email to North Wales force employees responding to a UK government statement that by 2020 the Home Office would have only half of the funds it had in 2010. He said: \"The police service represents the largest slice of the Home Office budget and therefore it is a realistic assumption that we will bear the brunt of any such reduction. \"Indeed, a further cut of between 25% and 40% is being suggested and you won't need me to tell you how this would represent a significant challenge for us (and other forces) to achieve in addition to that we have already saved and plan to save.\" North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Winston Roddick said the force had achieved \"tremendous success during a time of great challenge\". \"Further cuts are inevitable and will put greater pressure on staff and resources,\" he added.

The band added: \"We are very distraught about this as we are in Glasgow now and were very much looking forward to this show as one the highlights of our tour. \"We have been playing in extreme weather conditions throughout this European tour, and the last thing we want to do is see a show cancelled. \"We love our Scottish fans and we don't care if it's raining... sideways, although the safety of our fans and our crew is always our top priority. \"We love you Scotland, we love the city of Glasgow and it goes without saying that we will be back.\" In a strongly worded post on Instagram, the band's bassist Mike Dirnt posted a video of himself next to a Saltire.

{"article": "Some commentators feel the new constitution will further divide Egyptian society and may lead to more chaos. However, the new constitution had some takers among the press as well, who hailed the referendum's results. And a section of the press showed no interest in the referendum, commenting on the country's worsening economy instead. Hilmi al-Jazzar from the Muslim Brotherhood, which backed the new constitution, questions whether its approval constitutes the end of a phase or the beginning of a new one. In the independently-owned Al-Watan, he writes: \"The phase of constitutional vacuum is about to end, and with it the political debate about all constitutional declarations will end.\" But, Hilmi al-Jazzar goes on, \"a new political conflict is about to start\", this time involving those members of the opposition who are opposed to the constitution and those who are prepared to live with it. The commentator also urges the opposition groups to acknowledge the choice of the people, but expects the conflict to extend throughout the upcoming parliamentary elections. In the same paper, former Muslim Brotherhood member Muhammad Habib comments on what may follow the referendum results. He says: \"He who believes matters will proceed smoothly is mistaken. The reasons for congestion, tension and conflict persist. The breaches and irregularities during the referendum will make the situation worse.\" Source: Egyptian election commission . Constitutions compared . Ismail Ibrahim in the state-owned Al-Ahram al-Masai satirises the opposition which is calling for the new constitution to be abolished after the majority of voters approved it. Addressing them, he says: \"Those who participated in the referendum did not do so because the Muslim Brotherhood or religious groups gave them the choice, as some claim, between heaven and hell. They voted because they want to end a phase which threatened to make the country collapse over everybody's heads.\" In the official Al-Ahram newspaper, Muhammad Jamal Hishmat calls on Egyptians to focus on the coming period. He says: \"After the constitutional referendum ended with more than two-thirds of voters saying yes, everyone should look forward to what they may do in the coming period; even if it is to amend articles of the constitution. It is time the Egyptian revolution moved forward to achieve its targets.\" Writing in the Muslim Brotherhood's mouthpiece Al-Hurriyah wal Adalah, Asma Muhammad Ziyadah congratulates the Egyptian people on their \"great new constitution\". She says: \"The only people who would have benefited from the constitution not being approved are the remnants of the former regime who want the political, judicial and media authorities to be a field for their corruption, as the homeland is not in their minds and consciences.\" Concern is also growing in Egypt's press over the country's failing economic fortunes. A bold red headline on the front page of state-owned Al-Ahram is about the \"fear in the street\" over economic insecurity. Writing in the paper, Safwat Qabil urges politicians to leave the economy out of their squabbles. \"The later we start treating the economic crisis, the more severe the treatment will be,\" he warns.

{"article": "A trial of more than 500 patients found that it did not prolong or improve their quality of life any more than other forms of treatment. More than 45,000 people are diagnosed with lung cancer every year in the UK. In a third of cases, the cancer will spread to the brain. Secondary brain tumours are usually treated with whole brain radiotherapy along with steroids and other treatments to reduce the side-effects of cancer therapies. But it can have serious side-effects, such as nausea and extreme tiredness, and cause damage to the nervous system. This study, involving doctors, researchers and patients from hospitals right across the UK, found that there was no improvement in the quality of life of patients after one week of whole brain radiotherapy. These patients tend to already have a poor prognosis. Dr Paula Mulvenna, consultant clinical oncologist with Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said whole brain radiotherapy was used because it was thought to control tumours. \"But in our lung cancer clinics, we were not seeing the improvements we had hoped for in our patients. \"Survival times are poor and have hardly changed since the 1980s. \"What's more, the technique's toxicity can be substantial and it can damage cognitive function.\" According to Prof Ruth Langley, from the Medical Research Council clinical trials unit at University College London, radiosurgery - a very precise form of radiotherapy - is a favoured alternative technique, which has minimal side-effects. But some scientists say there may still be a place for whole brain radiotherapy. Writing in a linked comment in the Lancet, Dr Cecile le Pechoux from Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus in France said: \"We believe that optimised whole brain radiotherapy, given at the right time to appropriate patients, could lead to more individualised strategies.\" They said all treatments should be discussed with patients, taking into account the result of this trial.", "abstract": "Whole brain radiotherapy is of no benefit to people with lung cancer which has spread to the brain, says research in the Lancet.", "candidate": "Whole brain radiotherapy is no longer an effective treatment for lung cancer, say doctors writing in the Lancet.", "doc_id": 1337, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "Whole brain radiotherapy is no longer an effective treatment for lung cancer, say doctors.", "evidence": "\"But in our lung cancer clinics, we were not seeing the improvements we had hoped for in our patients.", "explanation": "The quote from the source does not say that it came from the Lancet, but was quote from a Dr directly.

{"article": "They believe ministers are placing too much emphasis on the environment at the expense of trees grown for timber. Britain is currently the world's third largest importer of wood. Ministers said they were encouraging commercial forestry organisations to invest in woodland creation. Conifer forests have been a familiar sight for half a century in Wales and have helped the timber industry grow. But Confor, which promotes the forestry industry, warns that at least 16,000 hectares - or 40,000 acres - of commercial forest have been lost since 2001 and need to be re-planted to meet needs. Half of the woodland is managed by Natural Resources Wales with the the other half by private companies. As an industry, it is estimated to be worth more than \u00c2\u00a3450m a year to the Welsh economy. But there is a conflict with environmental policy. Successive ministers have wanted more native, broadleaf species of trees and better access for walkers and bike riders while conservationists claim commercial forests are bad for wildlife. However, some forests in Wales are difficult to reach and hard to harvest while transporting the timber through rural communities can bring companies into conflict with local residents. The Welsh government wants a balance between the environmental, the economic and the social in how forestry is developed. It points to its Glastir scheme which encourages farmers and other landowners to plant woodland. It said its Woodlands for Wales forestry strategy \"sets out how we want Wales to be known for its high quality woodlands that enhance the landscape, provide real social and community benefits, support thriving woodland-based industries and contribute to a better quality environment\". Martin Bishop, of Confor, which represents 200 businesses in Wales, believes the emphasis on environmental aspects is seen as \"sexier\" than commercial forestry. He said the current system is also too bureaucratic for creating new woodland areas. Mr Bishop said 90 hectares were planted last year but there needed to be 20,000 hectares a year to meet long-term targets set by ministers. \"There's a huge market for our timber.

{"article": "Last year's champions led 17-10 at half-time with Noel Reid and Jack Conan scoring either side of Hamish Watson's impressive try for Edinburgh. Zane Kirchner extended Leinster's lead before Tim Visser's score and Sam Hidalgo-Clyne kicked the hosts ahead. But tries from Jordi Murphy and Luke McGrath, allied with solid Ian Madigan kicking, meant the Irishmen prevailed. Leinster end their campaign fifth, seven points shy of the semi-final places. Edinburgh finish eighth for the second consecutive season under head coach Alan Solomons, but with a total of 48 points this campaign compared to 38 last year. Add to that a European Challenge Cup final - albeit a defeat to Gloucester - and it seems the South African is making gradual progress at Murrayfield, where he recently signed a new 12-month contract. Hidalgo-Clyne's early penalty set Edinburgh off on the right foot but the visitors soon established a lead they would hold onto for the most of the match. A nice line-out collection by Leinster flanker Murphy presented Madigan with a drop-goal opportunity that the fly-half duly took. Madigan then combined well with Sean O'Brien to release Reid through the middle; the 24-year-old centre outpacing Edinburgh full-back Jack Cuthbert to cross between the posts. The conversion was added by the boot of Madigan but Edinburgh ensured the Irishman did not go out of sight. After Dougie Fife's claim for a try in the corner was ruled out, Watson found himself in possession from the line-out and gambled with a darting run to the line instead of spreading the play left were the hosts had numbers waiting. Watson, who won his first Scotland cap in this year's Six Nations, managed to get behind the posts and Hidalgo-Clyne converted. However, Leinster were quick to put on another display of quick hands and fast offloads in the middle to double their try count. This time Dave Kearney and Madigan gave substitute Conan the opportunity to split Edinburgh's defence with a piercing run and try, with Madigan again adding another two points. Hidalgo-Clyne heartened the hosts at the start of the second half with another penalty before Springbok winger Kirchner crossed on the right-hand side for Leinster, although there was no conversion on this occasion to compliment it. The Murrayfield men's resolve still existed and a fitting try for the Harlequins-bound Visser, who wrestled free to touch down, gave Edinburgh's record try scorer a final moment to remember in red and black. Hidalgo-Clyne's conversion and subsequent penalty put Edinburgh ahead for a few dreamy moments as thoughts of seventh place and a European play-off became a reality once more, but it was too much to ask of an injury-depleted side. Murphy and McGrath both ended a period of stout home defending to cross over late on and Madigan added the extras each time. Edinburgh: Cuthbert, Fife, Beard, Strauss, T.

{"article": "Mr Farage had previously said he would stand down after failing to win a seat in last week's general election. But the party said there was \"overwhelmingly evidence\" that UKIP members did not want Mr Farage to go. Writing in the Telegraph, Mr Farage said he had been \"reluctant\", but decided he \"owed it to the party to stay\" on as leader. UKIP won a 13% vote share in the election - some 3.8 million votes - and has one MP, Douglas Carswell, who held his Clacton seat. It puts the party in third place behind the Conservatives and Labour in terms of share of the vote. Mr Farage failed to gain the seat of Thanet South, losing out to Conservative candidate Craig Mackinlay. Speaking about his defeat, he insisted he had \"never felt happier\", with a \"weight lifted off his shoulders\". Who is more important to UKIP, Nigel Farage or Douglas Carswell? The answer to that question came just before 16:00 BST when the party announced its ex-leader was now its leader again. Nigel Farage has been persuaded to stay on. Technically he has managed to honour his pledge to stand down after he failed to get elected in Thanet South on Thursday. Two things are now clear: UKIP can't countenance a post-Nigel world. He is the party's biggest asset and it thinks a big chunk of those four million votes last week were down to him. But one senior figure has told the BBC Mr Farage's decision to stay is a \"mistake\" which will only undermine his reputation for straight talking. I think it's a safe bet to say that UKIP's only MP, Douglas Carswell, will not be happy. He heaped praise on his leader this morning but he spoke about him very much in the past tense. Party chairman Steve Crowther said the national executive committee believed the election campaign had been a \"great success\" and members had \"unanimously\" rejected Mr Farage's letter of resignation. \"He has therefore been persuaded to withdraw his resignation and remains leader of UKIP,\" a party statement said. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Farage said he had initially been reluctant, but then \"breathed deep, and thought for as long as I possibly had, given the meeting was ongoing\". \"I decided that as much as I had earned my holidays. As much as I wanted to spend the summer fishing, walking, and of course, in the European Parliament where all hell is currently breaking loose - that I owed it to the party that got me here,\" he said. He added there were \"huge battles ahead\", such as new EU proposals for Mediterranean migrant quotas and issues of electoral reform. Mr Farage had said repeatedly ahead of and during the general election campaign he had no intention of staying in the leader's job. In his autobiography, The Purple Revolution, he wrote: \"It is frankly just not credible for me to continue to lead the party without a Westminster seat. He added: \"Was I supposed to brief Ukip policy from the Westminster Arms? No - if I fail to win South Thanet, it is curtains for me. I will have to step down.\" The 51-year-old had recommended Suzanne Evans, the deputy chairman, to head the party until the leadership challenge was complete. Suzanne Evans said she was \"very pleased\" Mr Farage had agreed to remain leader. In a tweet, she wrote: \"Very pleased @Nigel_Farage still at the helm.

{"article": "Under the proposed legislation, first-time offenders who do not cause serious injury will face a maximum of 15 days police custody instead of up to two years in jail. It now needs the approval of the upper house and President Vladimir Putin. Campaigners say the bill - dubbed the \"slapping law\" - would mean the \"exoneration of tyrants in the home\". The State Duma voted 380-3 for the bill, two days after it passed its second reading. The bill, drafted by MP Olga Batalina, concerns assaults that inflict physical pain but do not cause bodily injury that threatens the victim's health. It followed a change in the criminal code in July which decriminalised battery against strangers, but made battery within the family a criminal offence. Conservatives argued that it was unacceptable that parents could therefore face harsher penalties for smacking their children than a neighbour would. Under the bill, the first offence would be considered administrative rather than criminal and punished with a fine of up to 30,000 rubles (\u00a3400; \u20ac470), detention of up to 15 days or compulsory community service up to 120 hours. Assaults causing serious injury or repeat offences within a year would still be criminal offences and carry potential jail terms. \"We want to show that Russian deputies will not allow the same excesses present in Western Europe,\" said ruling party lawmaker Andrei Isayev, claiming that European children \"inform on their parents\" in order to get their way, which leads to the parents losing custody. But MPs from the Communist Party opposed the bill. \"Women don't often go to the police or the courts regarding their abusive husbands, now there will be even fewer such cases, and the number of murders will increase,\" said lawmaker Yury Sinelshchikov. On Wednesday, Maria Mokhova, the executive director of the Sisters crisis centre for abuse victims, told Reuters: \"This law calls for the exoneration of tyrants in the home. \"The message is: 'Let's not punish a person who at home beat up his family, just because he has the right to do that.'\" Russian interior ministry statistics show that 9,800 women died as a result of a serious assault in 2015, and that a quarter of murders and serious assaults take place in the home.

{"article": "The Communist Party and military-run newspapers, such as the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily, are mostly carrying Xinhua news agency's round-up on the first day of the trial tucked away on the inside pages and make no mention of the case on their front pages. \"The accused, Bo Xilai, gave a statement on the bribery charges and denied the charges... The defendants and their counsel fully expressed their views. The defendant Bo Xilai was emotionally stable and his physical condition was normal during the hearing. The courtroom was orderly,\" says the terse Xinhua report without mentioning Mr Bo's defiant statements. Official online media websites, however, attacked Mr Bo's personal character and his rejection of bribery charges after the first day of the trial closed. \"One never expected that a corrupt element could be so composed when standing in the dock and that a criminal could be so glib when faced with various crimes... Faced with the solemnity of the court and the law and faced with irrefutable facts and evidence of criminal acts, Bo Xilai was not overawed in the slightest and had no repentance whatsoever!\" says a commentary on the state-run China Central Television website. \"Obviously, the legitimate rights of the defendant were fully guaranteed, and fairness, impartiality and transparency were a major feature of the trial. However, Bo's attitude towards the facts was to display cunningness and to deny them by every means possible,\" said one commentary in Communist Party-affiliated website Guangming Net. The mainland media are carrying fewer updates today from the Jinan court's official microblog, except video testimony from Mr Bo's estranged wife Gu Kailai about alleged payments received by the Bo family from tycoon Xu Ming. Over in Hong Kong, Beijing-backed newspapers praise the trial as a sign of the Communist Party's resolve to stamp out corruption, but independent press feels the party may find it tough to prosecute Mr Bo. \"The most sensitive and most watched case is being conducted with a most public and open attitude. The degree of openness of the Bo Xilai case has exceeded the expectations of the outside world,\" comments the Ta Kung Pao. \"The overseas media are interpreting the Bo Xilai case as a Chinese Communist Party power struggle which is indeed deliberately misleading and even bears ulterior motives,\" says the Wen Wei Po, another Hong Kong daily with close links to Beijing. Meanwhile, the independent Hong Kong press feel the trial ended up becoming the disgraced politician's \"individual show\". \"Unexpectedly, Bo Xilai retracted his testimony in court, and his rebuttal left the prosecution speechless. The entire trial was like Bo Xilai's individual show. The authorities face the embarrassment of an irredeemable situation on the Bo case... The authorities' investigation into Bo Xilai seems to lack sufficient evidence, and big gaps exist in their logic,\" concludes the Oriental Daily News. \"The shrewd and astute Bo is well aware that this is his last appearance in public and also his last public occasion to make statements and make his voice heard through the media. So despite his haggard appearance, he is as mentally agile as ever,\" notes the Hong Kong Economic Journal. Other Hong Kong newspapers question whether Mr Bo's defiance in court signals a looming power struggle within the ruling Communist Party. \"Regardless of whether this is a power struggle or a factional struggle, it was never going to be easy to prove Bo Xilai's corruption charges, but now aren't they riding a tiger and unable to get off? Will it be even harder to quell the political turmoil?.. Obviously, the public trial of the Bo case is a political show,\" says the Apple Daily .

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device . When Liverpool host Wolves in the FA Cup fourth round, it will be over two years since boyhood Reds fan Coady, now 23, was allowed to leave the club. And he is intent only on helping his side become the third in a week to win at Anfield. \"We're going there to win and hopefully take the game to them,\" he told BBC WM. Coady never got to play a home game in his three years at Anfield, with both his first-team appearances coming on the road, the second as a late sub for Philippe Coutinho in a 3-1 win at Fulham, his only one in the Premier League. After a season-long loan with Sheffield United, he eventually moved on to Huddersfield Town in August 2014 and then Wolves a year later. But Coady knows, from his experience watching the Reds as a boy, that Liverpool do not have many slumps of the current magnitude and Wolves might have timed their trip to Anfield just right. \"We've got a great chance the way Liverpool are playing,\" he said. \"They're a top team but they've had quite a lot of games.\" Since Wolves won 2-0 in the third round at Stoke on 7 January, Paul Lambert's men have only played twice, while Liverpool have been in action six times. Of those six games, they have won only once - the FA Cup third-round replay at League Two side Plymouth - have failed to score in three of them and have lost their last two at home. Following the shock home defeat by Swansea City which damaged their Premier League title hopes, Wednesday's League Cup semi-final exit to Southampton has cast a cloud over Anfield. \"We've got to take that into account,\" said Coady. \"We've got go there on the front foot, try to stop them playing, hopefully nick the ball and see if we can get something out of it.\" And what if Coady himself were to find the net? \"It would be what dreams are made of,\" he grinned. \"I'm not one of those who wouldn't celebrate.

His Aston Villa side did so in December 2012, and Wolves loan signing Andreas Weimann was one of the Villa scorers that day in a 3-1 victory. So can he do it again? Fourth in the Premier League v 18th in the Championship? \"We're up against an iconic club, and we're going to have to handle the atmosphere and the crowd, but I'd be disappointed if we couldn't handle the occasion,\" Lambert told BBC WM. \"If we can do that, we can win the game. And I believe in them. Mentally, they're ready for it. They'll handle it.\" Lambert is keenly awaiting his reunion with Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, who he first met when they did the Pro Licence coaching course together in Germany in 2004. He was playing for Celtic by then, long after he had helped Borussia Dortmund win the European Cup in 1997 and four years before Klopp took over as Dortmund boss in 2008. \"He was also at a club I was fortunate to play for,\" said Lambert. \"There were connections between us and he went on to bring Dortmund back to where they should have been - two league titles, two cups and a kick away from winning the Champions League. \"He is a big character and a really top guy.

Rob Baxter's side are now level on points with leaders Wasps, who play Worcester Warriors on Sunday, while reigning champions Saracens in third host fifth-placed Bath. Exeter's victory over Sale Sharks, however, was far from straightforward in blustery conditions in Devon.

In an email, seen by the BBC, Highways England suggests a southern bypass route would be \"considered\" as part of the \"design consultation\" phase of the upgrade. Last week, Atkins/Arup was awarded a \u00a317.5m design contract for the scheme.

There are growing concerns over congestion on the A303 which has been described as \"highly detrimental\" by English Heritage, which manages the monument. However, a group of historians - called the Stonehenge Alliance - has called for \"no further damage\" to the world heritage site. Historian Tom Holland, from the group, said the southern option was \"better than ploughing through the richest archaeological site in Europe\" and called for \"lateral thinking\" over A303 congestion. And Icomos, which advises UN cultural body Unesco, said it was \"concerned\" any upgrade could have a \"highly adverse impact\" on the World Heritage landscape around the stones.

{"article": "The Treasury says abolishing the grants, or bursaries, will allow many more nurses to be trained. But a Royal College of Nursing survey claims two-thirds of nurses wouldn't have studied nursing without them. They say it would make an existing staff shortage even worse. Bursaries are a means-tested allowance paid to those healthcare students who qualify, to help with living expenses during their training. Plans to scrap them were outlined by Chancellor George Osborne, as part of the government's Spending Review in November 2015. At the time he said the move would free up around \u00c2\u00a3800m a year in government spending and create up to 10,000 new training places. But since then, nurses and other health workers have been campaigning against the axing of bursaries. Student nurses are also going to have start paying tuition fees for their courses in the same way as other undergraduates - meaning they will have to take out a student loan. First year student nurse Ellie Archer has told the BBC that the bursary was vital in allowing her to pursue her dream career. She already has one sizeable student loan from another undergraduate degree and says: \"I really wanted to be a nurse and I can say without a doubt that if I had had to take out a loan to study to become a nurse, I would not have done it.\" Ellie believes the intensity of a nursing degree means students need extra support. \"Because of the amount of time spent on a placement it is very, very difficult to pick up second jobs, so there isn't really any other way of getting an income other than having the bursary in place.\" There is already a model of what a future without bursaries may look like at Chorley Hospital in Lancashire, which is part of the Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Student nurses there, who are on a course run in conjunction with the University of Bolton, are the first in England to pay their own way and once they have successfully completed the course, they are guaranteed a job. The trust's director of nursing and midwifery Gail Naylor explains: \"We had 800 applicants for 30 places, so I think what that tells us is, there really is the demand out there. \"Students are looking for different ways to train and we've been really successful in that.\" The Lancashire course is not alone in being oversubscribed. In 2014, there were 57,000 applicants for places on nursing degree courses, but the NHS in England could fund only 20,000 places. The Royal College of Nursing says a survey of 17,000 nurses reveals that two-thirds of them would not have studied nursing if faced with the prospect of taking out a student loan. RCN chief executive Janet Davies says: \"We're concerned that perhaps we won't get the same diversity of people coming into nursing that we have currently, that having to take out a loan will put people off, particularly those people who are more mature, who may have had a career previously and who are coming into nursing as a second career.\" However, many of those who run nursing training courses believe there is a case for change. Dame Jessica Corner, chairwoman of the Councils of Deans of Health which represents the universities that train nurses, says: \"This change actually enables universities to open up training places. \"At the moment they are capped, really on the basis of affordability and estimates of what the NHS might need, which have clearly been wrong over many years. \"So over time we think training places will be expanded and that will be good news for the NHS with more nurses and allied health professionals graduating.\" There is a shortage of qualified NHS nurses right across the UK. So far these changes are only being proposed in England. But faced with similar problems, politicians in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be watching very carefully to see what impact these changes will have.", "abstract": "Hundreds of nurses and midwives are expected to join a demonstration in London on Saturday calling for a rethink of plans to scrap maintenance grants for students in England.", "candidate": "Plans to scrap grants for student nurses in England have been criticised by the Royal College of Nursing.", "doc_id": 1361, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "But a Royal College of Nursing survey claims two-thirds of nurses wouldn't have studied nursing without them.", "explanation": "The summary is supported by the source text that \"Plans to scrap them were outlined\" discussing   abolishing the grants, or bursaries and that the Royal College of Nursing survey claims two-thirds of nurses wouldn't have studied nursing without them.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

He was jailed for four-and-a-half years but recalled to prison in August 2013 after breaking the terms of his licence. He has numerous distinctive tattoos including a black panther on his left arm and boxing gloves on his abdomen. Also on the list is Mohammed Jahangir Alam, 32, who was sentenced to 14 years in his absence in March 2010 for rape and sexual assault. Bangladeshi Alam arrived in the UK on a temporary visa in October 2007 and moved to Cheltenham the following year, where he sexually abused his victim, the NCA said. His last known address was in the E3 area of London. A third fugitive, 52-year-old Carlo Dawson, from Croydon, south London, is wanted on suspicion of indecently assaulting a 12-year-old girl and making indecent photographs of a child. He has a two-inch scar on his right palm. Hank Cole, the NCA's head of international operations, said: \"Spain is not a safe haven for British fugitives. The NCA and its partners will continue to pursue these individuals relentlessly and return them to the UK to face justice. \"The exceptional level of collaboration and intelligence-sharing with the Spanish authorities has been vital to these arrests.

Ex-Wales centre James says Cuthbert faces a big task to win the shirt back. \"He'll be very lucky if he gets back in,\" he said. \"I don't think he's put his hand up this season.\" Cardiff Blues' back Cuthbert, 25, has not played for Wales since their 26-23 win over Scotland in February at Murrayfield, their second match of Six Nations. He was left out of the matchday squads altogether for their three remaining fixtures. The previously prolific Cuthbert failed to score in 11 of the 14 matches he played for his region in the Pro12 during 2014-15, but crossed twice in their final fixture of the campaign against bottom side Zebre.

{"article": "Janet Commins' body was found near a school field in Flint, north Wales, by three children playing hide and seek. Stephen Hough, 58, from Flint, was convicted of manslaughter, rape and sexual assault at Mold Crown Court last week. He was cleared of murder. Hough was sentenced to 12 years and a further three after admitting sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl in 2016. The two sentences will run consecutively. After his arrest following the 2016 incident, Hough's DNA matched samples found on Janet's body, prompting his arrest and subsequent trial on charges relating to her death. Talking about the offences dating back to 1976, Mr Justice Lewis said Hough had shown \"no remorse whatsoever for what you did to that young girl\". \"You knew what you were doing... for your own sexual pleasure\". Hough was jailed for 12 years for manslaughter, eight years for rape and eight years for sexual assault - the sentences will run concurrently. The judge said he took into account the fact Hough was 16 when he committed the crimes. Janet went missing after leaving her home to go swimming on 7 January 1976. Four days later, her body was found under a thicket near a school playing field. She had been suffocated during a sexual assault. Noel Jones, who was 18 at the time, admitted killing her and served half of a 12-year prison sentence. Although he has never challenged his conviction, he told Hough's trial he was made a scapegoat by police because he was a barely literate Gypsy. Hough was questioned after Janet's death but was ruled out by police after he said he was stealing petrol the night she was killed - an offence for which he was fined. In 2016, his DNA was taken by police in an unrelated matter and a match was found with samples taken from Janet's body at the time. The jury heard it was a billion times more likely to belong to Hough than anyone else. Senior investigating officer Det Supt Iestyn Davies said: \"Very quickly after his DNA was taken [in 2016] and entered on the database, it hit against a crime stain from that 1976 investigation and that prompted us to fully reopen the case.\" Trisha Foley, scientific support officer with North Wales Police, praised the \"foresight\" of the scientists dealing with the case at the time. \"The fact that the material was placed onto slides and then a slip was added over actually preserved that evidence. \"To obtain not only a profile but a full DNA profile with a statistical probability of one to a billion that it matched Stephen Hough, in that timescale - that's a significant result.\" The court heard Hough had been court-martialled in 1988 for grievous bodily harm with intent while serving as a soldier in Germany. He attacked a hotel receptionist and was in the process of \"strangling\" her when he was disturbed by others. He was jailed for five years, reduced through the ranks and discharged. Det Supt Davies added: \"Janet was subjected to an horrific, sustained and brutal sexually-motivated assault and the impact upon her family, friends an the entire community was enormous. \"Hough is now in prison, where he rightly belongs.\" In a victim impact statement read out in court, Janet's uncle Derek Ireston described his niece as a \"loving child, slightly timid and shy, but fun to be with\". He said Hough \"stole Janet's future\" and her mother Eileen has been \"hurting and suffering for 41 years\". His statement added: \"The investigation in 1976 seemed to me to be shoddy... anything as a family that we put forward was dismissed. \"We also, as a family, feel for Noel Jones who has also suffered so much since 1976.\" The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating how North Wales Police handled the original investigation. Iwan Jenkins, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"The huge advancements in forensic testing since the 1970s were the key factor in being able to bring this case to court. \"Our thoughts have been with Janet's family throughout the investigation and trial.

The examinations, held by the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB), began on Tuesday and are scheduled to go on until 24 March. Officials say more than 1.4 million students are taking the tests. Most of the incidents of cheating this year have been reported from Saharsa, Chhapra, Vaishali and Hajipur districts. Local newspapers have been full of photos of parents and relatives trying to help their children cheat even at considerable risk to their own lives, BBC Hindi's Manish Saandilya reports from the state capital, Patna. Some photos even show policemen posted outside the centres accepting bribes to look the other way, our correspondent adds. Photojournalist Dipankar, who took the photos in Saharsa district, says when he went into the examination hall and began taking pictures, the students did not seem worried at all. Despite the many reports that have appeared in the local newspapers, the authorities seem uninterested in taking any action against the students, he says. Dipankar says during a raid at just one school on Wednesday, the authorities seized sheets containing answers which filled up nine sacks. Nearly 20 parents were detained briefly for trying to help their children cheat, but they were let go after a warning, he adds. At some schools, like this one in Saran in Chhapra district, parents also clashed with the police. Those caught cheating can be barred from taking an examination for up to three years, they can also be jailed or ordered to pay a fine, but punishment in such cases has rarely been reported in Bihar. Education officials say they are committed to holding free, fair and peaceful examinations, and that examination centres are being filmed and special \"flying squads\" of officials are making surprise visits to the centres. They say at least 400 students who have been caught cheating have been expelled.

{"article": "The clause backing \"common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange\", was scrapped under Tony Blair in 1995. Speaking to the Independent on Sunday, Mr Corbyn said Labour \"shouldn't shy away\" from public control of railways and public investment in industry. Leadership rival Liz Kendall told the paper Clause IV belonged in the past. Tony Blair's move two decades ago to ditch the long-standing commitment in Labour's constitution to public ownership was seen by some as a symbolic step which made the party more electable in the post-Margaret Thatcher era. The original wording of Clause IV was replaced with a new commitment to \"a thriving private sector and high-quality public services where those undertakings essential to the common good are either owned by the public or accountable to them\". Mr Corbyn told the IoS he could consider bringing back the old Clause IV as part of a commitment to take \"necessary things\" back into public ownership. \"I think we should talk about what the objectives of the party are, whether that's restoring the Clause IV as it was originally written or it's a different one, but I think we shouldn't shy away from public participation, public investment in industry and public control of the railways,\" he said. \"I'm interested in the idea that we have a more inclusive, clearer set of objectives. I would want us to have a set of objectives which does include public ownership of some necessary things such as rail.\" Mr Corbyn's campaign momentum seems unflagging - to the alarm of senior figures in the party. But he says the party needs a new statement of objectives - and that could be the original Clause IV. Jeremy Corbyn has already promised to renationalise energy companies and the railways and increase public spending on industry. One of Mr Corbyn's leadership rivals, Liz Kendall, condemned the idea as a \"throwback to the past\". Some party donors are alarmed by the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn win too.

Mr Corbyn is one of four candidates standing in next month's Labour leader election, alongside Liz Kendall, Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham. Ms Kendall - the leadership challenger seen as being the closest to Mr Blair's policies - fiercely condemned the idea of bringing back Clause IV. \"This shows there is nothing new about Jeremy Corbyn's politics,\" she said. \"Life had moved on from the old Clause IV in 1994, let alone 2015.

{"article": "Luis Barcenas will be asked about documents published in El Pais newspaper that allegedly show payments to leading PP members, including Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. Mr Barcenas and Mr Rajoy both strongly deny any wrongdoing. Financial markets slumped earlier this week amid worries about the claims. State prosecutors, who received the documents from El Pais on Tuesday, are holding preliminary investigations to see if anyone has broken the law. El Pais says Mr Barcenas wrote the documents that it published last week, describing them as the PP's \"hidden accounts\". They contain lists of donations against the names of senior members of the party, including Mr Rajoy. Mr Barcenas arrived by taxi at the anti-corruption prosecutors' office accompanied by his lawyer, Alfonso Trallero, Spanish media report. A crowd of onlookers and journalists had gathered, and shouts of \"thief!\" and \"where is my envelope?\" could be heard. On Saturday, Mr Rajoy went on TV to deny ever having received secret or improper payments. Key players: Spanish 'slush fund' Q&A: Spain's corruption scandal . Small groups of demonstrators took to the streets in Madrid, Barcelona and Seville calling on him to step down, and clashes with police took place in the capital at the weekend. Mr Barcenas stepped down as treasurer in 2009 after being implicated in a separate corruption case known as the Gurtel scandal. In that case, he stands accused of tax fraud and receiving illegal payments, claims he also denies. He is due to be questioned by investigating judge Pablo Ruz about the Gurtel case on 25 February, El Pais reports. Correspondents say the latest allegations have particularly angered the public because Mr Rajoy's government is demanding huge sacrifices from the public as the country battles recession and 25% unemployment. The central claim is that documents published by El Pais are a list of undeclared cash \"donations\" linked to senior PP members. Until 2007, Spanish political parties were allowed to receive anonymous donations. Spain's chief prosecutor has said there could be enough evidence to investigate the allegations. The PP has said it will take legal action against those responsible for what it says is a smear campaign, and Mr Rajoy has promised to publish his earnings online. Opposition leader Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba has called for him to resign, but the BBC's Tom Burridge in Spain says that, as things stand, that looks unlikely. Political scientist Anton Losada of Santiago de Compostela University said that the prime minister would find it harder to implement austerity policies. \"There is a high political cost to pay, with a problem of legitimacy,\" he told AFP news agency. \"He cannot demand sacrifices and at the same time make money, especially if it is not legal.\" According to Ferran Requejo, a political scientist at Barcelona's Pompeu Fabra University, Mr Rajoy would now struggle to be taken seriously in the eurozone. \"An accusation of corruption in a governing party is a serious accusation,\" he told AFP news agency. \"He is not going to be listened to the slightest bit by the European institutions.\"", "abstract": "A former treasurer of Spain's governing Popular Party (PP) has arrived for questioning by prosecutors in Madrid over claims of secret payments.", "candidate": "The former treasurer of Spain's governing Popular Party (PP) has been questioned by anti-corruption prosecutors.", "doc_id": 1394, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "The former treasurer of Spain's governing party PP has been questioned by anti-corruption prosecutors.", "evidence": "Mr Barcenas stepped down as treasurer in 2009 after being implicated in a separate corruption case known as the Gurtel scandal.", "explanation": "Source text does not support full name of governing party but it does support other assertions in the summary that anti corruption prosecutors are questioning a former governing party treasurer.", "instruction": "Remove the information about full name of the governing party from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about full name of the governing party from the summary."]}}

{"article": "Mr Drumm, who resigned in December 2008 as the bank was collapsing, was brought before Dublin District Court on Monday to be charged with 33 offences. They include false accounting linked to transactions worth 7bn euros (\u00a35.4bn). He was arrested in the early hours of Monday after arriving at Dublin Airport on an overnight flight from Boston. Garda\u00ed (Irish police) accompanied the former chief executive on the transatlantic flight and shortly after landing he was brought to a Dublin police station, and then escorted to the court. The hearing was told that Mr Drumm made no reply when police officers put the charges to him at the station. Sixteen of the charges relate to the alleged provision of unlawful financial assistance to 16 wealthy investors, in a bid to prop up Anglo's share price before the collapse. Mr Drumm moved to the US in 2009, the same year Anglo Irish Bank had to be bailed out by Irish taxpayers. Police objected to his bail application, claiming the accused is a potential flight risk. A sergeant told the court police believed Mr Drumm had the capacity to flee the jurisdiction and seemed to have access to large sums of money when required, despite owing millions in debts. A prosecution lawyer told the court the accused had fought tooth and nail against his extradition from Boston and had been leading the authorities a \"merry dance\" during the process. However, Mr Drumm's solicitor said his client had offered to surrender his passport, be tagged and sign on twice daily at his local police station. The defence lawyer added that the accused had offered to provide a \"relatively large\" amount of cash and had several family members who were willing to \"put their houses on the line\" so he could be granted bail. The judge granted bail on Mr Drumm's own bond of 50,000 euros (\u00a339,000) and two independent sureties of 50,000 euros. Mr Drumm ran Anglo Irish Bank from 2005 to 2008 and subsequently filed for bankruptcy in the US. However, the bankruptcy bid failed and a Boston court ruled that he could be held liable for debts of 10.5m euros (\u00a38.34m). It was alleged during the bankruptcy case that the 48-year-old former bank boss secretly transferred money and assets to his wife, so they could not be seized during bankruptcy proceedings. Authorities in the Republic of Ireland issued an extradition request last year and he was arrested at his American home in October. At a hearing in Boston last month, Mr Drumm agreed to return to the Republic of Ireland as soon as possible. Bailing out the bank cost Irish taxpayers about 30bn euros (\u00a322bn: $34bn), close to one-fifth of annual output. Its downfall played a large role in the collapse of the Irish economy in 2008 and the ensuing bailout from its eurozone partners two years later.", "abstract": "David Drumm, former boss of the Anglo Irish Bank, has been granted bail by an Irish court after he was extradited from the US to face fraud charges.", "candidate": "Former Anglo Irish Bank boss David Drumm has been granted bail after his extradition from the US.", "doc_id": 1396, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Former Anglo Irish Bank boss Mr. Drumm has been granted bail after his extradition from the US.", "evidence": "Mr Drumm ran Anglo Irish Bank from 2005 to 2008 and subsequently filed for bankruptcy in the US.", "explanation": "The summary has hallucinated that the first name of mr drum is David because that information cannot be found in the source text.", "instruction": "Remove the information about David from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about David from the summary."]}}
{"article": "They were followed by announcements from skin care firm Syneron-Candela and Japanese mattress maker Airweave. It comes after Lochte lied about being robbed at gunpoint by a policeman after a night out during the Rio Olympics. Lochte, a 12-time Olympic medalist, has earned millions of dollars through endorsements. Speedo, the biggest sponsor of the four, said: \"We cannot condone behaviour that is counter to the values this brand has long stood for.\" Lochte, aged 32, said he respected Speedo's decision, and thanked the company. \"I am grateful for the opportunities that our partnership has afforded me over the years,'' he said. Speaking on US talk show Today, Lochte said: \"I made a mistake and I definitely learned from this. They put on a great Games... and my immature, intoxicated behaviour tarnished that a little.\" Ralph Lauren, which has removed some of Lochte's images from its website, said its sponsorship of the swimmer had been only for the Rio Olympics and would not be renewed. Ralph Lauren and Airweave both stressed that they would continue their support of the US Olympic and Paralympic teams. Syneron-Candela said: \"We hold our employees to high standards, and we expect the same of our business partners.'' Speedo said it would donate a $50,000 portion of Lochte's sponsorship fee to the charity Save The Children's Brazilian operation. The value of Lochte's Speedo sponsorship has not been disclosed. The contract reportedly expires this year after 10 years. The US business magazine Forbes calculated that in the year of the 2012 London Olympics, Lochte earned about $2m in sponsorships from companies such as Gillette, Nissan, AT&T and Gatorade. Lochte's performance at Rio did not reach the heights of his London triumph, but Forbes estimated his endorsements would still have been between $1m-$2m. The saga started when Lochte and three team-mates returned to the Olympic village after a late night out in Rio. They tried, unsuccessfully, to use the locked toilet at a garage and urinated outside instead. After first claiming that he and his three team-mates had been robbed by bogus policemen, Lochte back-tracked and admitted he had, while still drunk, \"left details out\" and \"over-exaggerated some parts of the story\". Despite the evidence against him, including CCTV footage, he has however denied that he actually lied in his initial account to Brazilian police. Lochte's behaviour has been met with disdain in the US and he has been widely pilloried in the US media. On 19 August the New York Post carried a front-page headline describing him as the \"Ugly American\", along with the slogan \"Liar, Liar, Speedo on fire\". Lochte is one of the most successful swimmers in history, with 12 Olympic medals, and he once had his own reality television show in the US. In Rio, he swam in two events, winning a gold medal in the 4x200m freestyle relay along with team-mate Jack Conger. \"We appreciate his many achievements and hope he moves forward and learns from this experience,\" Speedo said of Lochte.", "abstract": "Four sponsors have dropped disgraced US Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte, including swimwear manufacturer Speedo and fashion label Ralph Lauren.", "candidate": "US Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte has lost sponsors Speedo and Ralph Lauren over his behaviour at the Rio Games.", "doc_id": 1403, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "US Olympic swimmer Lochte has lost sponsors Speedo and Ralph Lauren over his behaviour at the Rio Games.", "evidence": "Speedo, the biggest sponsor of the four, said: \"We cannot condone behaviour that is counter to the values this brand has long stood for.\"", "explanation": "IT MAKES UP lOCHTE'S FIRST NAME", "instruction": "Remove the information about lOCHTE'S FIRST NAME from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about lOCHTE'S FIRST NAME from the summary."]}}

Investigators from 21 countries gathered at Interpol's headquarters in France in October to share information on suspects involved in a range of crimes involving the environment. Called Operation Infra Terra, the agency is now asking for assistance from the public in tracking down nine key suspects. \"Even the smallest detail, which you might think is insignificant, has the potential to break a case wide open when combined with other evidence the police already have,\" said Ioannis Kokkinis, from Interpol. \"Sometimes all it takes is a fresh pair of eyes to bring new momentum to an investigation and provide the missing clue which will help locate these wanted individuals, some of whom have been evading justice for years,\" he added. One of those named is Feisal Mohammed Ali, alleged to be the leader of an ivory smuggling ring in Kenya. He is being sought in connection with the seizure of 314 ivory pieces, weighing well over two tonnes in Mombasa in June. Others on the list include Ahmed Kamran who was charged with an attempt to smuggle over 100 live animals, including giraffes and impalas, to Qatar on a military plane. Ariel Bustamante Sanchez is alleged to have been involved in illegal tuna fishing in protected waters off Costa Rica. The move has been welcomed by Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites). They are concerned not just with the impact of environmental crime on species but also with the effect on political stability. \"Countries are increasingly treating wildlife crime as a serious offence, and we will leave no stone unturned to locate and arrest these criminals to ensure that they are brought to justice,\" said Ben Janse van Rensburg from Cites. \"The public can play a crucial role in this collective effort, they our eyes and ears on the ground.

{"article": "During a visit to Birmingham on Tuesday, Jeremy Corbyn is expected to say a 17% increase in Carer's Allowance would help around one million people in the first year of a Labour government. Under the plan, Carer's Allowance would rise from \u00a362.70 to \u00a373.10 a week. Ministers say they will spend an extra \u00a32bn on social care over three years. Carer's Allowance is paid to around 6.5m people in the UK who care for older, disabled and seriously ill friends or relatives for at least 35 hours a week. Eligible carers cannot earn more than \u00a3116 a week after tax. Mr Corbyn said he believed it \"would be a good thing to do\" to help carers, \"usually women\" who have to give up their jobs to look after elderly relatives at home. \"Caring for people is stressful,\" he told the BBC. \"In some way it's enjoyable because you want to do it, but you shouldn't be impoverished because of it. It's also lonely.\" In his speech later, the Labour leader will claim \"Britain's social care crisis was made in Downing Street by cutting \u00a34.6bn from council care budgets\". \"Millions of unpaid carers have been forced to fill the gap and put under even greater pressure as a result,\" he will say. \"The care they give to the disabled, sick and elderly saves taxpayers \u00a3132bn a year. So we believe these unsung, unpaid heroes not only deserve our praise and recognition - they deserve better financial support. \"That's why Labour is convinced it's both morally and economically right to give the Carer's Allowance a boost of \u00a310 a week. \"We also think it's only fair that this extra support for carers is funded by scrapping the Tory cut on inheritance tax, which will only benefit the wealthiest people in Britain. \"This will be the first step in helping to transform our social care system for the 21st century and boosting support for family carers.\" According to Labour, up-rating Carer's Allowance would cost \u00a3538m by 2020/21.

It says that the security forces are allegedly responsible for at least 46 deaths which occurred in protest-related violence. The findings are based on interviews. A statement released on Tuesday says that \"in the absence of responses from the Venezuelan authorities to requests for access, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein deployed a team of human rights officers to conduct remote monitoring of the human rights situation in the country \". The UN human rights team conducted interviews remotely because its requests for access went unanswered by the Venezuelan authorities. Witnesses told the UN that the Venezuelan security forces had fired tear gas and buckshot without warning. \"Security forces have reportedly also resorted to the use of deadly force against demonstrators,\" the statement reads. \"Since the wave of demonstrations began in April, there has been a clear pattern of excessive force used against protesters. Several thousand people have been arbitrarily detained, many reportedly subjected to ill-treatment and even torture, while several hundred have been brought before military rather than civilian courts,\" Mr Hussein said. He pointed out that \"some groups of demonstrators have also resorted to violence, with attacks reported against security officers\". The UN human rights team said that estimates suggested that more than 5,000 people had been arbitrarily detained between 1 April, when the protests began, and 31 July. The high commissioner urged the Venezuelan authorities \"to immediately end the excessive use of force against demonstrators, to halt arbitrary detentions and to release all those arbitrarily detained\". Shortly after the report was issued, Venezuela's Supreme Court ordered the arrest of opposition mayor Ram\u00f3n Muchacho. The court had sentenced him to 15 months in prison and barred him from office in the early hours of Tuesday. The court said Ram\u00f3n Muchacho had failed to prevent barricades from being erected during anti-government protests held in Chacao, the opposition stronghold he governs. After a nine-hour debate, the Supreme Court found Mr Muchacho, 44, guilty of failing to enforce a court order on preventing the blocking of roads. Chacao has been one of the neighbourhoods in the capital, Caracas, at the centre of anti-government protests that have swept through Venezuela in the past four months. It is a gathering point for demonstrations and its roads are often blocked by \"trancones\", blockades organised by the opposition to show their rejection of the government. On 24 May, after eight weeks of anti-government protests, the Supreme Court ordered Mr Muchacho and seven other mayors to prevent barricades being erected, and where roads had been blocked, to remove the obstacles. The court warned that if the mayors did not follow the order, they could face between six and 15 months in jail. Apart from Mr Muchacho, three other opposition mayors have also been found guilty for failing to prevent barricades from being erected.", "abstract": "The United Nations Human Rights Office has warned of \"widespread and systematic use of excessive force\" being used against protesters in Venezuela.", "candidate": "The United Nations human rights team has accused the Venezuelan security forces of using excessive force against protesters.", "doc_id": 1428, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "The UN human rights team has accused the Venezuelan security forces of using excessive force against protesters.", "evidence": "A statement released on Tuesday says that \"in the absence of responses from the Venezuelan authorities to requests for access, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein deployed a team of human rights officers to conduct remote monitoring of the human rights situation in the country \".", "explanation": "Although it is well known that UN is the abbreviation of United Nations but since this is not supported by the source text which refers to the organization as UN so the summary is incorrect.

{"article": "When the nozzle releasing a stream of molten glass is raised above a certain level, that thread begins to wobble. It traces out waves or loops - which the team found could be controlled by adjusting the speed of the nozzle. Those shapes then become the building blocks for intricate, 3D objects. Engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology pioneered a method for glass 3D printing in 2015. They then started to work with mathematician Pierre-Thomas Brun, who has studied the fluid dynamics of liquid \"ropes\". The results are documented in a video, which the team presented in the American Physical Society's \"Gallery of Fluid Motion\" in November. It all started with a collaboration between two labs at MIT, Dr Brun told the BBC - one specialising in glass and the other in \"mediated matter\". Runny honey . \"Normally when you 3D print, the nozzle is very close to the piece that you're printing - that's the conventional method. But what they started working with was having a large offset. \"And in that case, instead of having a thread that falls down and moves straight, you can create coil-like patterns like honey on toast.\" That coiling process, as it happens, is exactly what Dr Brun studied during his PhD. \"I came up with a reduced model that explained the dynamics of these things,\" he said. \"So I have a way to rationalise the patterns they observed, and we started working together in order to create some structures that take those patterns as building blocks.\" Suddenly, instead of being a potential flaw in the system, the wobbling of the liquid glass became a tunable design feature. And what is more, some of the tiny loops are smaller than anything that could be created by moving the nozzle itself around. The physics of the dribbling glass itself was now a precision instrument. What most impressed Dr Brun was how simple it was to control that instrument. For a given nozzle height, he explained, everything boils down to how fast the glass is being poured, relative to how fast the nozzle is moving forward. \"These coils may seem complex, but you can rationalise them in a very simple way. And to do that you need one number: how fast is the glass falling onto the surface?\" If the dribbling of the glass starts to outstrip the forward progress of the nozzle, the thread will trace out a meandering, wavy line instead of a straight one. Then if the forward motion gets even slower, the glass will start to trace small, alternating loops. Even slower, and the loops become one big coil. It was a surprise, Dr Brun said, that this simple ratio produced such a variety of shapes. \"This is a very complex system, but you can forget about all the other properties. That's a big statement, which has no reason to be true - but it is, in this case.\" Following the lead of other researchers, studying the dynamics of viscous liquid threads nearly 10 years ago, Dr Brun and his colleagues called their system a \"sewing machine\". \"It does exactly what a sewing machine does,\" he observed. \"You go from a thread, to patterns which are tied to each other like stitching patterns - but this time they're made out of glass.\" Many of his collaborators at MIT are interested in potential applications for architecture, and the design may also prove useful in sculpture and in 3D printing - or \"additive manufacturing\" - more widely. \"There are many possibilities, but for now this is just a proof of concept,\" Dr Brun said.

{"article": "After 11 years in the role, Prof Christianne Glossop told BBC Wales: \"There hasn't been a day gone by where I haven't been focusing on TB.\" She defended the Welsh Government's efforts to fight the disease, after accusations of \"dithering\" by unions. Farmers' leaders have renewed calls for a badger cull. They claimed at the Royal Welsh Show in Llanelwedd that post-Brexit trade deals could be at risk. Government statistics show 8,103 cattle were slaughtered in Wales as a result of bovine TB in 2015 - up more than a quarter on 2014, when 6,378 cattle were killed. Prof Glossop said it was important not to judge the eradication programme in Wales based on one indicator alone. \"If we're winning the battle we have to understand everything about the disease. \"We are digging deeper into the farms that have TB, we are testing harder, we're using more sensitive tests and we're also taking more animals that have an inconclusive reaction. \"The aim is to get infection out of the farm as quickly as possible - and as a result of that we are taking more animals right now.\" Since the start of the Welsh Government's TB eradication programme in 2008 there has been a 37% reduction in incidents of TB. Prof Glossop said about 5% of farms in Wales were currently experiencing problems. But the issue is concentrated, with far higher incidence levels in west Wales and along the border with England. A five-year project to vaccinate badgers in north Pembrokeshire is currently on hold due to a global shortage of the BCG jab. Farming unions have urged the government to cut its losses and scrap what they say is \"pointless and costly\" trial. Prof Glossop said it was too early to tell whether it had worked or whether the government would restart the project in 2017. \"Should we be in a position to access vaccine next year we'd have to look at computer modelling and ask is a fifth year of vaccine in one area going to deliver benefits that are worth the cost,\" she said. \"It's an expensive business and very labour intensive\". Gareth Richards, a dairy farmer from Abergwili in Carmarthen whose farm has been hit three times by bovine TB, described the government's efforts to eradicate the disease as \"basically terrible\". He added: \"It's too much of a political hot potato and it's decimating the Welsh countryside as a result.\" FUW president Glyn Roberts said: \"We know that the current rates of bovine TB may represent a significant threat in terms of meat and dairy exports once we are outside the EU, and there is a real risk that our current TB status could be used against us during trade negotiations. \"This means that we have to proactively address the problem, otherwise we might jeopardise all UK trade negotiations with Europe.\" This autumn will see the return of badger culling in England, with pilot culls ongoing in Gloucestershire, Somerset and Dorset. Prof Glossop will address farmers at a seminar at the FUW pavilion at the Royal Welsh Showground on Wednesday on the issue of tackling bovine TB in future.

He was shot when police stopped a car near junction 24 of the M62 on Monday evening. Traffic on the motorway slowed as about 100 people, including the dead man's parents, gathered near the site to lay flowers and light candles. Mohammed Yaqub, Yassar's father said he felt his son was \"killed unlawfully\". He said: \"He hasn't got a bad past, because he's never been convicted of anything. \"He's never had a charge of him at all. We had a car business, by the way, so all sorts of cars come and go.\" \"I want answers, full answers, nothing but the truth. \"How can you kill someone like this, at a time like this, without giving him a chance to get out or anything? We're not in America, we're not in third-world countries. \"We'd like to be left to mourn.\" Balloons were released into the night sky and the gathering was \"very peaceful and respectful\" said BBC reporter Ian White, who was at the scene. The police operation is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). In 2010, Mr Yaqub was cleared of attempted murder and a firearms offence after it was alleged that he opened fire on a car in Birkby Hall Road, Huddersfield. Earlier, Bradford West Labour MP Naz Shah appealed for calm after the shooting sparked a protest. On Tuesday evening, protesters carrying banners reading \"stop the killings\" brought traffic to a halt in Leeds Road, Bradford. Writing on Facebook, Ms Shah said: \"I urge our community to remain calm and respect the wishes of the family who have lost their loved one and have appealed for calm and privacy during this very difficult time.\" Two men arrested as part of the police operation on Monday have been released on bail, while three more remain in custody. An Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) spokesman said what appeared to be a \"non-police issue firearm\" was discovered in the vehicle in which Mr Yaqub was travelling. West Yorkshire Police said officers attended Leeds Road at about 19:15 GMT to \"facilitate a peaceful protest and to provide public reassurance\". A force spokesman said: \"Police empathise with the heightened tensions and engaged with protestors to appeal for calm.\" A spokesman for Mr Yaqub's family said they were \"in shock, and distraught\" by his death. Nadeem Murtuja, chairman of campaign group Just Yorkshire, said: \"There is a great deal of disquiet in the community about the death of Mr Yaqub. \"It is crucial that both his family and the Huddersfield community are kept informed about the conduct of the investigation and the events that led to the fatal shooting.\" Five men were arrested on suspicion of possessing firearm with intent to cause fear during the police operation, including three following the M62 operation and two following a vehicle stop in the Chain Bar area of Bradford. A police spokeswoman said three of the men remain in police custody while two men, aged 26 and 30, have been released on bail pending further enquiries.

The crisis was sparked by the murder of an ex-IRA man and the Ulster Unionists' subsequent exit from the executive. Arlene Foster said the DUP was prepared to take \"our own action\" if the government did not intervene. \"We will be taking unilateral action next Monday,\" the finance minister said. \"We will give them space the rest of this week to come forward with their own solution, but if nothing happens between now and next week we will be taking our own action.\" The assembly is due to return from its summer recess next Monday, and Mrs Foster said it would \"certainly be very different\" after a turbulent month in Northern Ireland politics. After meeting with Secretary of State Theresa Villiers on Wednesday, Sinn F\u00e9in's Alex Maskey said the party again made clear its opposition to any assembly suspension. \"Martin McGuinness made it very clear to the secretary of state that any suggestion that the British government should suspend these institutions, Sinn F\u00e9in will be very, very hostile to that,\" he said. \"Further to that we will not be in any way cooperating with the concept of self-suspension. \"We believe that people out there want all the parties to ensure that these institutions succeed and more importantly that they deliver for the communities.\" Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt said it was up to the Northern Ireland parties to sort out the crisis. \"I believe we can sort it out if there's political will and we certainly have the will to sort this out, because we don't want to collapse anything, we want to fix everything,\" he said. In August, police said they believed Provisional IRA members were involved in the murder of Mr McGuigan Sr. Chief Constable George Hamilton said the paramilitary organisation still has structures in place at a senior level but added there was no evidence that hierarchy had sanctioned the killing.

{"article": "A High Court judge in Belfast had ruled that the PSNI should not have facilitated illegal parades, and was wrong to think it did not have legal powers to stop them. The ruling was quashed after an appeal. The UK Supreme Court has now been asked to overturn the decision. There were widespread loyalist protests across Northern Ireland after Belfast City Council decided not to fly the Union flag at the City Hall every day of the year in December 2012. The protests included a weekly parade between east Belfast and City Hall, which passed the nationalist Short Strand area. Critics accused the police of being too soft as some of the protests descended into violence. The PSNI insisted it did not have the legal powers to stop them, and warned that doing so might have made the situation worse. In April 2014, a judge in the High Court in Belfast upheld a claim by a Short Strand resident, who cannot be named to protect his safety, that the PSNI had failed in its legal duty to stop the parades. The judge said the police had not understood the full scope of their powers and had facilitated illegal and sometimes violent parades, in breach of their legal duties. That ruling was appealed by then Chief Constable Matt Baggott, and quashed by the Court of Appeal. The legal battle moved to the UK Supreme Court in London on Tuesday. A lawyer representing the unnamed resident, told five judges the PSNI had failed in its duty to enforce the law as set out in the Public Processions Northern Ireland Act (1998). She argued that the Court of Appeal had no grounds to interfere and overturn the original trial decision as \"the evidence before the court was unimpeachable\". The lawyer said there were \"evident flaws\" in the Court of Appeal decision and its analysis of the evidence. Lord Neuberger, President of the Supreme Court, asked her: \"So you say that we should go back to the trial judge and, provided we concluded that there was evidence on which he could fairly reach the decision that he did, that we should reinstate his decision?\" She replied: \"Yes.\" But a lawyer representing the PSNI said the Court of Appeal had made the correct decision. He said the context of the time the protests had taken place was important. He told the court the police had been dealing with a series of sporadic unplanned protests at more than 80 locations across Northern Ireland. He insisted there had been \"no error of law\" and that the police fully understood that they could have stopped the parades, but took an operational decision not to so. He said the police believed that \"robust action\" could have made the situation worse and took a deliberate decision to secure evidence of offences committed and to prosecute offenders afterwards. The lawyer referred to research by Queen's University, which recorded that 306 people had been convicted of flag-protest-related offences across Northern Ireland in the months after the protests. \"Many would have considered the police approach to policing these parades was successful, and that their policy of de-escalation succeeded,\" he said. The judges said they would announce their decision \"in due course\".", "abstract": "A resident of the Short Strand area of east Belfast has challenged a decision to overturn a court ruling that the PSNI was wrong not to stop union flag protests.", "candidate": "The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has asked the UK's highest court to overturn a ruling that it failed in its legal duty to stop loyalist flag protests.", "doc_id": 1460, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "A Short Strand resident has asked the UK Supreme Court to reinstate a lower court ruling that the PSNI failed in its legal duty to stop loyalist flag protests.", "evidence": "The legal battle moved to the UK Supreme Court in London on Tuesday.", "explanation": "Very little is correct in the summary:  (1) the summary states that PSNI is an acronym for Police Service of Northern Ireland, which is true, but not mentioned in the source text; (2) per the source text, the PSNI had won their case at the Court of Appeal and the appeal to the Supreme Court was done by the Short Strand resident to reinstate a lower court finding that the PSNI had failed in its duty -- certainly the PSNI would have preferred not to go to the Supreme Court; (3) the summary mentions UK's highest court, but the source text mentions the UK Supreme Court.", "instruction": "Remove the information about the meaning of PSNI from the summary.

Co-star Harrison Ford said he was \"shocked and saddened\" by the news. \"Our thoughts are with Carrie, her family and friends,\" he said. Ford played Fisher's on-screen love interest in the franchise, and Fisher revealed earlier this year in a memoir that the pair had a brief off-screen romance.

I encourage everyone to pray for her.\" Fisher had been on tour promoting her latest book, The Princess Diarist. The heart attack happened about 15 minutes before the plane landed in LA, celebrity news website TMZ reported. A medic who was travelling on the plane administered CPR.

A law enforcement official told NBC that her condition was \"not good\". Passengers on the plane have been tweeting about what they saw.

{"article": "The Bishop of Cork, Dr Paul Colton, is thought to be the first Church of Ireland bishop to make such a statement. Last month, the Assembly rejected a motion calling for the introduction of same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland. Dr Colton also said he hoped the church would one day recognise same-sex marriages in religious ceremonies. He told BBC Radio Ulster's Sunday Sequence programme that it was a very \"divisive\" debate. \"The events in society are moving very rapidly and the church is not at all up to pace with the debate,\" he said. \"I certainly support civil same sex marriage. \"I also recognise that the church of Ireland's definition of marriage is for itself and I adhere to that discipline... but that is not to say that everyone must be required to take the church of Ireland's view of marriage. \"Having said that I'm also among those in the church, and perhaps we're only a minority, albeit a significant one that long to see the day when we can have a discussion - as we've had discussions over the years on all sorts of other issues about the nature of marriage - with a view, ultimately, at least to the blessing of same sex couples following civil unions if not to their marriage in church as is happening in other parts of the Anglican communion.\" The Church of Ireland's LGBT affirming group, Changing Attitude Ireland, welcomed the comments. Chairman Dr Richard O'Leary said: \"The bishop's acknowledgement of the hurt that the church has inflicted on its gay and lesbian members is greatly appreciated especially as it comes on the day we are holding services to mark the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia (IDAHOT)\". Last month, Stormont rejected same-sex marriage for the third time in 18 months. Northern Ireland is now the only part of the UK which has not passed a law to introduce same-sex marriage. The first gay marriages have recently taken place in England and Wales, with Scotland due to follow later this year . Ahead of the assembly motion, the Church of Ireland restated its position on same-sex marriage, repeating what was affirmed at its general synod in 2012. \"The Church of Ireland affirms, according to our Lord's teaching, that marriage is in its purpose a union permanent and life-long, for better or worse, till death do them part, of one man with one woman, to the exclusion of all others on either side. The Church of Ireland recognises for itself and of itself, no other understanding of marriage,\" it said. Catholic bishops in Northern Ireland wrote an open letter to all MLAs urging them to reject the motion.

Mr McKay had said they wanted to ensure they did not prejudice a police investigation or any potential criminal trial. The National Crime Agency is leading the criminal inquiry into the Nama loan sale controversy and is concerned its investigation could be undermined. The National Assets Management Agency (Nama) is the Republic of Ireland's \"bad bank\", set up to deal with toxic loans during the Irish banking crisis. Nama's Northern Ireland portfolio, known as Project Eagle, was sold to the US investment fund Cerberus for more than \u00a31bn last year.

The money moved to the Isle of Man was later retrieved, though Mr Coulter and and his former partners at Tughans remain at odds on the circumstances of that transaction.

The Daily Telegraph said the London gallery must know it has a \"winner\" with its \"outstanding\" exhibition. \"I eat it with my eyes and never feel sated,\" said The Guardian's critic. Many of the items will be seen together for the first time in the exhibition, which opens on Thursday and features about 130 artworks from the latter stage of Matisse's career. The Telegraph said that \"the joy of the cut-outs is their simplicity\". The paper's critic said the artworks were made from \"modest materials\" using \"basic techniques\" but that the artist \"reduces art to the essentials of colour, shape and pattern\". \"Yet precisely because they offer us instant visual gratification, it is easy to forget how innovative they actually are,\" he wrote. The Guardian added that the show was \"ravishing, filled with light and decoration, exuberance and a kind of violence\" adding that it was \"about more than just pleasure\". \"Matisse created a universe that filled the room around him, spilling from the walls to the floor.\" Matisse worked from a wheelchair after treatment for cancer and the exhibition compiles work dating from 1937 to 1954, when he died aged 84 of a heart attack. Sir Nicholas Serota, the Tate director and co-curator of the show, told the BBC the works displayed great skill. \"Cut-out sounds a bit simplistic, they are very sophisticated objects. \"The brilliance is that he took the method of a child and deployed it with all the sophistication of an artist who had been painting for 60 years.\" He said that the artworks were \"incredibly influential\" on a generation of American painters in the 60s and 70s. \"The colour is really intense, the colour is brilliant, it's really not quite what we associate with the immediate post-war years in Europe.

{"article": "The 50 planes around the world were grounded due to battery malfunctions that saw one 787 catch fire in the US. Over the past week teams of Boeing engineers have been fitting new batteries to the aircraft. This was after aviation authorities approved the revamped battery design. The Ethiopian Airlines plane took off at 09:45 local time (07:45 GMT) and landed in Nairobi, Kenya, some two hours later. Each 787 has two of the lithium-ion batteries which caused problems. In addition to new versions of the batteries which run at a much cooler temperature, the batteries are now enclosed in stainless steel boxes. These boxes have a ventilation pipe that goes directly to the outside of the plane. Boeing says this means than in the unlikely event of any future fire or smoke, it would not affect the rest of the aircraft. By Richard WestcottBBC transport correspondent, Nairobi . Flight ETH 801 between Addis Ababa and Nairobi wasn't exactly a run-of-the-mill flight. For starters, it was full of Boeing executives and the boss of Ethiopian Airlines. Several passengers on board asked me what was going on, why was the BBC on a routine flight in Africa? Many didn't realise that they were the first passengers to fly in a Dreamliner since it was dramatically grounded in January. There were plenty who knew about the safety scare surrounding the plane, although only a couple that we spoke to said it had made them a little more tentative about flying. Boeing still has a huge job on its hands, convincing passengers that its most high-profile, most hi-tech airliner is safe. Two senior Boeing executives went out of their way this week to tell me that they'd happily put their family on the plane. It's the kind of quote that sounds good. Still, Boeing will be desperately hoping that its Dreamliner nightmare doesn't come back to haunt it. Boeing said it put 200,000 engineer hours into fixing the problem, with staff working round the clock. On Thursday, the US Federal Aviation Administration issued a formal \"air worthiness\" directive allowing revamped 787s to fly. Japanese airlines, which have been the biggest customers for the new-generation aircraft, are expected to begin test flights on Sunday. A total of 300 Boeing engineers, pooled into 10 teams, have in the past week been fitting the new batteries and their containment systems around the world. Boeing is expected to complete repairs on all 50 of the grounded Dreamliners by the middle of May. In addition to the Dreamliners in service with airlines, Boeing has upgraded the 787s it has continued to make at its factory in Seattle since January. The Dreamliner entered service in 2011. Half of the plane is made from lightweight composite materials, making it more fuel efficient than other planes of the same size. The two lithium-ion batteries are not used when the 787 is in flight. They are operational when the plane is on the ground and its engines are not turned on, and are used to power the aircraft's brakes and lights.", "abstract": "An Ethiopian Airlines 787 Dreamliner has flown from Addis Ababa to Nairobi, the first commercial flight by the Boeing aircraft since all 787s were grounded in January.", "candidate": "Boeing's 787 Dreamliner has flown for the first time since it was grounded in January.", "doc_id": 1485, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "Many didn't realise that they were the first passengers to fly in a Dreamliner since it was dramatically grounded in January.", "explanation": "it correctly pulls the info (Boeing, Dreamliner, 787, grounded, Jan) from the source text", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

If any of this sounds familiar, there is a chance you could be spending too much time on social networks. An exclusive online Newsbeat poll suggests that a quarter of 15 to 18-year-olds in the UK feel happier online than they do in real life. Dr Radha from The Surgery on Radio 1 has dealt with patients who have displayed \"a lot of social anxiety\" because they are using social networks too much. \"Being online can provoke a sense of 'I'm not good enough, everyone else is having an amazing life',\" she explained. \"It doesn't give us a sense of reality and actually what you will find is most people are probably doing the same thing as you are.\" The survey, carried out last month, also suggests a third of 15 to 18-year-olds have met someone in person they originally met through social media. Dr Radha has said it is important people carefully consider what information they share with the online community. \"What this survey showed is a lot of people go online alone,\" she said. \"In terms of our personal details and how we respond to messages from other people, we need to make sure we are looking after all of that safely.\" Dr Radha was concerned that some people feel safer dealing with people online, rather than in person. \"The more time we spend online, the less we are able to develop our social skills,\" she explained. \"When you are online you're not getting eye contact with people or perceiving how body language is changing, so as a result what people are saying can be misinterpreted. \"Physical contact, like a hug and a kiss, is really important.

The DUP emphasised its potential role in a hung parliament, while Sinn F\u00e9in portrayed the contest as a battle against austerity; a stepping stone towards next year's D\u00e1il and Stormont elections. However it was certainly packed with incident. The local parties complained about being excluded from the UK-wide debates, but threats of legal action came to nothing. The two main unionist parties were accused of playing sectarian politics when they agreed a pact in four seats. Sinn F\u00e9in faced the same allegation after distributing a leaflet in North Belfast that equated Catholics with nationalists and Protestants with unionists. The DUP had to defend including a feasibility study for a tunnel to Scotland in its manifesto. Sinn F\u00e9in had to explain an apparent promise from one of its candidates to pay off people's credit card debts. SDLP leader Alasdair McDonnell kept a low profile during debates and hustings. The former leader Mark Durkan didn't seem to bother defending Dr McDonnell against criticism of his double jobbing in the BBC's final election debate. Mindful of the pact, the Ulster Unionists muted their criticism of the DUP, whilst working to try to make up the ground against the bigger party in a couple of key seats. Other parties such as the TUV and UKIP targeted the Northern Ireland Executive parties' track record at Stormont and the mandatory coalition system that makes it so hard to change the make-up of the devolved government. The Greens emphasised their opposition to any welfare cuts. The DUP endeavoured to keep the focus on the UK-wide position and the need to strengthen the union. But same-sex marriage - now the subject of a referendum in the Republic of Ireland - forced its way on to the agenda. That eventually led to the big political story of the campaign - the resignation of Stormont Health Minister Jim Wells after making controversial comments on homosexuality and child abuse at a Downpatrick hustings. On the lighter side, I haven't covered a campaign before where a candidate (the UUP's Robin Swann) says he was been mistaken for a male stripper while canvassing a house.

Once the votes are cast and the ballot papers counted, we will know whether the local parties will be in a position to make a difference in a hung parliament.

{"article": "A \"terrorist hide\" was uncovered at Capanagh Forest near Larne after two members of the public found suspicious objects in the woods on Saturday. Some of the items found included an armour-piercing improvised rocket and two anti-personnel mines. The main line of police inquiry is the arms belonged to dissident republicans. Last week, Home Secretary Theresa May said MI5 believed an attack on targets in Great Britain by dissident republicans had become \"a strong possibility\". Analysis: Vincent Kearney, BBC News NI's home affairs correspondent . The discovery of what appears to be a second dissident republican arms dump near Larne within three months has left police baffled. Based on location alone, the analysis would be that the items found most likely belonged to loyalist paramilitaries. But the nature of what was found suggests otherwise and the finger of suspicion firmly in the direction of dissident republicans. Det Supt Kevin Geddes said the threat level in Northern Ireland from dissident republican groups remains \"severe\" and an attack is \"highly likely\". Police officers found three barrels hidden in holes in the forest. As well as rockets and mines, there were also several pipe bombs, assault rifle ammunition and parts to construct a \"substantial number of explosive devices\". Det Supt Geddes said the seizure was significant \"both in terms of its size and its capability\". \"A number of these devices were ready to be deployed,\" he added. \"This seizure has undoubtedly saved lives.\" He said the type of weapons that had been found meant police would focus their investigation on dissident republicans. In March, an arms find was made at Carnfunnock Country Park near Larne, and police said the were investigating a connection between the two discoveries. \"There are links in terms of the general location and the manner and method of storage and packaging of these munitions,\" Det Supt Geddes said.

{"article": "It said the compression ignition engine was up to 30% more fuel-efficient than its current engines. It plans to sell cars with the new engine from 2019. Last week, Mazda said it would work with Toyota to develop electric vehicle technology and build a $1.6bn plant in the US. Mazda research and development head Kiyoshi Fujiwara said it was imperative for the company to pursue the \"ideal internal combustion engine\". \"Electrification is necessary but... the internal combustion engine should come first,\" he said. Mazda said the Skyactiv-X, as it is known, would be the world's first commercial petrol engine to use compression ignition. The technology breakthrough puts the firm ahead of rivals including Daimler and General Motors that have worked on compression ignition for decades. According to Mazda, the fuel-air mixture ignites spontaneously when compressed by the piston in the new engine. The carmaker said the Skyactiv-X combined the advantages of petrol and diesel engines to improve efficiency. It has no plans to supply the engine to other carmakers. The move comes as the car industry pours massive investment into electric technology in response to stricter emissions standards around the world. The UK will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2040 in a bid to reduce air pollution. In July, Volvo said all new models will have an electric motor from 2019. The Chinese-owned firm aims to sell one million electric cars by 2025. Mazda also plans to introduce electric technology in its cars from 2019. In theory, a compression-ignition petrol engine should have big advantages. But it isn't easy to make technology work - and some of the biggest companies, including General Motors, have already tried. So why should a relatively small Japanese manufacturer like Mazda succeed? Well, partly because - unlike the really big players - it isn't afraid to take risks. It has done in the past. It's the only mainstream manufacturer, for example, which has persisted with rotary engines in its cars. Like compression ignition motors, they have theoretical benefits, but create complex engineering challenges. Mazda's rotary has had some success. The company won the Le Mans 24 Hours race with it in 1991, and the latest version was fitted in its RX-8 sportscar. Popular with drivers, it was sadly unreliable. If the new motor is to be a success, it needs to be reliable as well as efficient. And Mazda needs to be able to persuade regulators that petrol engines still have a strong future. It may prove to be the perfect stop-gap, as electric cars are developed and charging infrastructure is created. Or it may turn out to be a brilliant idea, which has come to fruition just a few years too late.", "abstract": "Japanese carmaker Mazda has developed a more efficient petrol engine at a time when the industry steers toward electric vehicles.", "candidate": "Japanese carmaker Mazda has unveiled what it says is the world's most fuel-efficient petrol engine.", "doc_id": 1497, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Mazda has unveiled what a more fuel-efficient petrol engine.", "evidence": "It said the compression ignition engine was up to 30% more fuel-efficient than its current engines.", "explanation": "it makes up the country Mazda is from, and that it made the world's most fuel-efficient petrol engine.", "instruction": "Remove the information about the country Mazda is from from the summary.

{"article": "Murray, the first British man to reach a Roland Garros final since 1937, hopes to add the French Open to his victories at the US Open and Wimbledon. Djokovic, the world number one, can finally add the one major title to have so far eluded him. It will be the pair's seventh meeting in a Grand Slam final. Djokovic leads that head-to-head 4-2, their overall contests 23-10 and has 11 major titles to Murray's two - but it was the Serb whom Murray beat to claim his Grand Slam victories at the US Open in 2012 and Wimbledon in 2013. The Scot also won their most recent meeting in the final of the clay-court Italian Open four weeks ago. Listen - Can Murray fight French Open demons? There is a huge amount at stake for both men in Sunday's final, with Murray again looking to match Fred Perry, Britain's last male champion in 1935. Sue Barker won the women's title in 1976 but since then a surprise run to the semi-finals by Tim Henman in 2004, followed by three semi-finals for Murray, were the best any Briton had managed on the Paris clay. \"It's obviously a very big match for both of us, Novak trying to win the career slam and me trying to win my first French Open,\" Murray said. \"Neither of us know how many more chances we'll have to win here. It's a very tough event to win. \"There's a lot riding on the match for both of us.\" It is the first final between two top seeds trying to win a Grand Slam title for the first time since Ivan Lendl beat John McEnroe in Paris 32 years ago. Murray will hope to emulate the achievement of his former coach - and then second seed - Lendl, and he takes on a very familiar rival. Both finalists turned 29 last month and have known each other since junior days - but Djokovic has taken a firm grip on their personal duel in recent years, winning 12 of their last 14 matches. \"We have had some really big battles in the Slams before on all the other surfaces,\" Murray said. \"I'm sure it will be the same again on Sunday.\" Murray needed five sets to beat Radek Stepanek and Mathias Bourgue in his first two matches, and four sets to beat Richard Gasquet in the quarter-finals, but played superbly to beat defending champion Stan Wawrinka on Friday. \"The conditions aren't that easy,\" he said. \"It's been cold, wet, slow - much, much slower than what we played in the last few weeks. \"Obviously getting through difficult matches, you can find your rhythm. I spent a lot of time on court at the beginning of the event. I'm starting to feel better every day.\" Djokovic and Murray have stood at the top of the rankings for all but a week in 2016 - but the Serb has a huge lead and would hold all four Grand Slam titles with another victory over Murray. Only American Don Budge in the 1930s and Australia's Rod Laver in the 1960s have achieved that feat, and just seven men have completed the career slam. However, Djokovic has played three French Open finals without success, losing twice to Rafael Nadal and then suffering a surprise defeat by an inspired Wawrinka 12 months ago. \"I've put myself in a position in which I wanted to be in of course ever since last year's final,\" Djokovic said. \"It's always high on the priority list when I start a season, thinking about Roland Garros.\" Subscribe to the BBC Sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.", "abstract": "Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic will meet in Sunday's French Open final - with both men seeking their first title in Paris.", "candidate": "Britain's Andy Murray will take on Novak Djokovic in Sunday's French Open final in the hope of winning his first Grand Slam title.", "doc_id": 1499, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Britain's Murray will take on Novak Djokovic in Sunday's French Open final in the hope of winning his first French Open title.", "evidence": "Djokovic leads that head-to-head 4-2, their overall contests 23-10 and has 11 major titles to Murray's two - but it was the Serb whom Murray beat to claim his Grand Slam victories at the US Open in 2012 and Wimbledon in 2013.", "explanation": "Summary incorrectly claims that Murray hopes to win his first Grand Slam as the source text makes it clear that Murray has won Grand Slams before and he is hopes to win his French Open.

A union said the idea was \"terrible\" but families deserved to know the truth about funding. A Department for Education (DfE) spokesman said new funding plans would increase the trust's budget by 2.4%. The Olympus Trust runs one secondary, one all-through school and five primary academies in South Gloucestershire, to the north of Bristol. In the letter Mr Baker warned parents of the \"unthinkable\" decisions the trust could be forced to make from September. These include shortening the school day \"because we cannot afford to staff lessons for the whole week\". Other proposals are cutting teaching and support jobs within the schools, increasing class sizes and reducing the curriculum. The letter also says parents may be asked to make regular financial contributions to supplement school funding. Mr Baker said South Gloucestershire was one of the five worst-funded local authorities so had less reserves to draw upon. Beckie Morton, a parent of two daughters at Charlborough Road Primary School, is anxious about the impact any cuts will have on her girls, aged 10 and seven. She said: \"It's shocking - I don't know what I'd do work-wise if they shortened the school day. \"If they do this, all that will be left is the lessons and no extra support for pupils. \"My eldest daughter suffers panic attacks and has received a lot of pastoral care - this will have a massive impact on her final year there.\" Natalie, who has a son attending at Bradley Stoke Community School, called the proposals \"diabolical\". She said: \"At the moment we are hoping to have a special needs support worker for my son and if they cut funding he won't have that. \"I don't blame the school, they are trying their best.\" In December, the government announced the biggest shake-up of school funding for decades. The DfE said the current system was \"unfair, opaque and outdated\" and the changes would see more than half of England's schools get more cash. \"We recognise that schools are facing cost pressures, which is why we will continue to provide support to help them use their funding in cost-effective ways, including improving the way they buy goods and services, so\u00e2\u20ac\u017d they get the best possible value. \" Kevin Courtney, chair of the National Union of Teachers (NUT), said schools were still facing an 8% reduction in spending power.

{"article": "It could lead to new ways of diagnosing the condition and of testing the effectiveness of new drugs. The technology, reported in the journal Neuron, can identify inside a living brain clumps of a protein called tau that is closely linked to the disease. Alzheimer's Research UK said it was promising work. Alzheimer's disease is a problem for researchers trying to come up with a cure. The brain starts to die years before any symptoms are detected, which means drugs are probably given too late. A diagnosis of Alzheimer's cannot be made with absolute certainty until a patient has died and their brain is examined. It is also not 100% clear what is the cause of the dementia and what are just symptoms. One protein, called tau, is very closely linked to the disease, with tangles of tau thought to be one way in which brain cells are killed. The team, lead by the National Institute of Radiological Sciences in Chiba, used positron emission tomography to build a 3D picture of tau in the brain. They developed a chemical that could bind to tau and then be detected during a brain scan. Tests on mice and people with suspected Alzheimer's showed the technology could detect tau. Dr Makoto Higuchi, from the National Institute of Radiological Sciences in Japan, said: \"Positron emission tomography images of tau accumulation... provide robust information on brain regions developing or at risk for tau-induced neuronal death.\" The research is at an early stage, but it could eventually lead to an actual test for Alzheimer's disease. It might also allow researchers to closely follow the impact drugs that affect tau have on the brain. Another protein - beta amyloid - is also linked to Alzheimer's and can be detected in similar tests. Dr Eric Karran, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \"This promising early study highlights a potential new method for detecting tau - a key player in both Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia - in the living brain. \"With new drugs in development designed to target tau, scans capable of visualising the protein inside the brain could be important for assessing whether treatments in clinical trials are hitting their target. \"If this method is shown to be effective, such a scan could also be a useful aid for providing people with an accurate diagnosis, as well as for monitoring disease progression.\"", "abstract": "Pioneering brain imaging that can detect the build-up of destructive proteins linked to Alzheimer's has been developed by Japanese scientists.", "candidate": "Scientists in Japan have developed a new way to detect Alzheimer's disease during a brain scan.", "doc_id": 1503, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "Scientists in Japan and the UK have developed a new way to detect Alzheimer's disease during a brain scan.", "evidence": "Tests on mice and people with suspected Alzheimer's showed the technology could detect tau.", "explanation": "This was a dual effort by scientists in both countries.", "instruction": "Add the information about scientists in the UK also being part of the development to the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Add the information about scientists in the UK also being part of the development to the summary."]}}

Spotify has more than 60 million regular users across 58 countries. It says about 20% pay for its premium ad-free subscription services. Chief executive Daniel Ek said that represents more than half of the global market in \"streaming dollars\". The company said it had also taken steps to match the music tracks it suggests to the various activities users engage in throughout their day. This includes a new running mode, which matches music to the pace of the subscriber based on feedback from their smartphone's built-in sensors. The firm said it had also created a new type of audio format that allows a song's tempo to be altered to match a runner's footsteps while keeping it in tune. And it has commissioned new track from composers and DJs including Tiesto, who made a brief appearance at the firm's New York press conference. \"If it works, the ability of Spotify to adapt what it plays you as the day progresses is interesting,\" commented Andy Malt, editor of the music business news service Complete Music Update. \"Being faced with a choice of tens of millions of tracks is daunting for a lot of users when they open the app, and while that catalogue is a big sell for the engaged music fans who were streaming's early adopters, it's less appealing to mainstream users. \"The less users have to interact the more music the app can serve up to them. Adding non-music content, including podcasts and video, also has the potential to keep users within the Spotify app for longer.\" One of the new pieces of audio content is BBC Minute - an \"alternative\" round-the-clock news service, aimed at a youth audience, already offered to other digital platforms. Launched in April, it is a 60 second conversation of shareable news, updated every half hour. In addition, for a year-long period, overseas Spotify users will be able to listen to around 50 speech-only podcasts from BBC stations. \"These programmes are already freely available in the UK, so we're running this trial only for overseas users,\" the corporation said in a statement. \"This means we can generate income for the BBC to reinvest in programmes for licence fee payers as well as reaching new audiences across the globe.\" Disney, the sports network ESPN, the science-tech talks organiser TED, Conde Nast Entertainment and the US TV channels MTV and NBC are among those who have also committed to providing material. Spotify said it would suggest video and audio shows to users based on their past use. The announcement comes less than three weeks before Apple's developers conference, when the iPhone-maker is expected to reveal plans for a streaming music service based on its takeover of Beats Music. Spotify is also facing new competition from Tidal, a music service relaunched by the musician Jay Z and backed by other famous stars. Jay Z said last month that it had signed up 770,000 subscribers. The new services are initially restricted to iPhone users in the US, UK, Germany and Sweden, but will later be extended to other platforms and countries. Streaming may well be the future of music and Spotify may be the future of streaming, as Daniel Ek claims, but the Swedish chief executive faces a twin threat. Apple is about to launch its own music service and will be determined to win back customers lost to Spotify as downloads have stagnated. And the music labels, which have absolute power over the streaming company, have been flexing their muscles, making it clear they could withdraw their artists. So, by offering a new service which is about more than music Spotify hopes to take on Apple by winning over the kind of music fans who also like to snack on YouTube videos or catch up with podcasts. Meanwhile, it will be able to show the music labels that it has other options.

{"article": "It found children from deprived backgrounds were twice as likely to face police action than better-off children who commit the same crime. Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls. The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live. The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers. They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18. Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts. And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending. This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said. They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime. The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts. Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said. This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account. The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal. The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles. It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government. Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: \"Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty. \"As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish.\" Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime. A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities.

{"article": "The ex-Bury and Sheffield United player was abused while at Crewe Alexandra from the age of 11 to 15. His abuser, Barry Bennell, was jailed for nine years in 1998 after admitting sexual offences against six boys. Warnock said Mr Woodward gave other alleged victims the courage to speak. Mr Woodward, was the first to go public last week, and has since been followed by several others who have made allegations about being sexually abused by coaches as children. Cheshire Police said 11 people had come forward after Mr Woodward waived his anonymity, including his fellow ex-Crewe player Steve Walters, 44, who said he had been abused by Bennell, when he was 13 or 14, during a trip to Anglesey. A dedicated NSPCC hotline - 0800 023 2642 - set up after the abuse claims came to light, received more than 50 calls within its first two hours. Abuse claims: Who has spoken out? Football abused 'could number hundreds' We must protect next generation - FA chief . Warnock said he had spoken to Mr Woodward before he went public. ''I had an hour with him on the phone and in that conversation he broke down in tears because it's horrific,'' the Cardiff manager said. ''It's alright saying it's a long time ago but to actually confront it in the media takes so much guts. ''I've told him how proud I am of him and I think by his bravery it will open up everything now and it will be a relief for so many ex-players that have been through the same situation.'' He added: ''I wasn't aware how bad it was at the time when I helped him. He was at Bury and I thought he was outstanding so I'd promised to take him with me when I went to Sheffield United. ''But then he just lost his form overnight with no real reason, until he spoke to me. I felt I had to carry on and take him because I'd given him my word. ''When you listen to his story and when I look back now, I couldn't understand it at the time and I don't think any of us could ever envisage what Andy and the other lads have had to go through. ''I think it becomes easier now. Now it's out in the open I think they can get on with their lives and I think Andy will help a lot of people. He's that type of person who will talk to those who want privacy and help them. ''It's a good thing he's set in motion because I think what Andy brought out is the tip of the iceberg and we'll see that in the coming months.'' Warnock said measures had been put in place in recent years regarding checks on young players' coaches and there was now support for those who need it. He said: ''I think there has to be changes but we have everything in place, financially and everything, we have no excuse to let young lads down now.

{"article": "Shortly after telling the BBC his story the father, called Jahangir, received a call from Ashraf Ghani assuring him that arrests would be made. His wife was allegedly raped in Badakhshan province eight years ago. But Jahangir says he has been unable to get the alleged rapists arrested because they are politically powerful. His wife told BBC Persian about the incident. \"I told one of them, for God's sake, I have just given birth, I'm like your child, even your daughter is older than me,\" she said. \"I cried a lot, they beat me all over my head and body,\" she said. \"Their bite marks were still on my body until a couple of years ago.\" Analysis: Inayatulhaq Yasini, BBC Pashto . The stand taken by Jahangir and his wife breaks something of a taboo in Afghanistan, where victims of sexual crime are generally cowed into silence. Soon after the media picked up the case, President Ghani spoke with Jahangir and promised him that \"the case will be investigated properly and perpetrators will face justice\". The victim herself told the BBC: \"I want justice to save other women from such a fate.\" In the wake of the publicity, the Afghan government will be under pressure to investigate the incident properly and ensure some kind of resolution. But there are also hopes that the stand taken by Jahangir and his wife will embolden other victims of sexual crime, and have a lasting affect on how such cases are dealt with. Jahangir, a policeman, told the BBC eight men were arrested after the incident, but six have now been freed because of their political connections. He says he and his family had to flee to the capital, Kabul, fearing for their lives. He has threatened to kill himself unless that changes: \"If they are not put on trial, I'll have to commit suicide to escape the tensions I'm suffering from. There's no other way.\" Jahangir went public with the threat on Afghan television. He later met the country's interior ministry to press his case. While speaking to the BBC following the meeting, he received a phone call from Mr Ghani. He wept as they spoke. Mr Ghani was sworn in as Afghan president in September, pledging to tackle the issue of corruption as a priority.

The figures emerged in the 2016 Welsh Election Study. Cardiff University's Professor Roger Scully said voters were \"unlikely to notice\" the loss of MEPs after Brexit. But Mr Vaughan, a Wales MEP since 2009, said it is \"difficult\" for MEPs to get recognition. Prof Roger Scully, principal investigator for the Cardiff University-led 2016 Welsh Election Study, said it was probably unsurprising that Mr Gill came top given his higher profile role in the assembly election campaign. \"But none of the other Welsh MEPs were selected by a greater proportion of the study respondents than that legendary figure in Welsh politics 'Elwyn Davies' - whose contributions to our national political life I feel I need not elaborate upon,\" he said. Prof Scully, who spent the early part of his career studying in the European Parliament, said most MEPs are \"very hard-working individuals\". But he added: \"We will, of course, very likely be losing our MEPs when the UK leaves the EU. \"But on these results, it seems fair to say that most of the Welsh public are unlikely to notice.\" Those surveyed were asked: \"Wales is represented by four members in the European Parliament. Which, if any, of the following people are among Wales' four representatives in the European Parliament?\" They were given only 30 seconds to answer, to prevent them from searching on the internet, and were given the choices of four entirely made-up names and two real MEPs.

The presence of beavers has been found previously in the Highlands. In 2008, one was found dead on a beach at Eathie on the Black Isle after suffering what police described as a \"cruel\" death after ingesting a large quantity of sea water. Police suspected the animal was linked to illegal releases of beavers in other parts of Scotland. Native Scottish beavers were hunted to extinction in the 16th century. Last year, the Scottish government announced that beavers reintroduced to Scotland could remain and were given protected status.

Both groups will be allowed to expand naturally but will be managed to protect farmers and land owners. But in the case of the Beauly beavers, Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said the animals had been released illegally and must be removed. She said: \"We have been clear that we are minded that beavers can remain in Scotland and that their range can expand naturally. \"But the unauthorised release of beavers is a criminal offence and will damage the beaver reintroduction project. \"That is why I am asking Scottish Natural Heritage to take swift action in the Beauly area.

In spite of this diagnosis his sense of humour never failed him and he continued to live a full and happy life,\" he added. Valentine's wife, the actress Susan Skipper, said: \"Tony was my best friend and it was a privilege to know, love and care for him.\" The couple first met on Yorkshire Television's Raffles and then appeared together three years later on the television film of Ivor Novello's show The Dancing Years. They married in 1982. As well as his starring role in Colditz - which centred around the inmates of the notorious German prisoner-of-war camp - and Raffles, Valentine was also known for playing the character of upper-class thug Toby Meres in the secret agent drama series Callan, starring Edward Woodward. The actor was born in Blackburn, Lancashire, but went to school in London. He began his acting career at the early age of 10 and appeared in several BBC children's TV shows, including an adaptation of the classic Billy Bunter stories. He worked pretty much continuously from the 1950s and had roles in TV dramas throughout the decades, including Lovejoy, New Tricks, The Detectives, Heartbeat, Casualty and Coronation Street. His last TV role was as a voice actor for the animated series Chuggington: Badge Quest in 2011.

British food and drink exports as a whole grew by 8.3% year-on-year to \u00a34.9bn - the largest first quarter figure on record. FDF credited better promotion of UK goods abroad, and the weaker pound. Sterling has fallen by about 16% against the dollar since Britain voted to leave the EU last June, making UK produce more competitive overseas. Quoting UK government figures, the group said whisky had remained the top food and drink export during the period, with sales of \u00a3895.9m. This was followed by Scottish salmon and chocolate. 2016, as a whole, was a record-breaking year for food and drink exports. That momentum appears to be continuing in 2017. This is good news for the industry and the government as it seeks new markets for British goods. Exports to non-EU countries have been growing at a faster rate than those to the EU for the last couple of years. A growth rate of 40% in South Korea is pretty impressive. But that still only amounts to some \u00a350m worth of business. Compare that to Ireland, where we generated some \u00a3854m worth of exports in the first three months of this year. Ireland remains our most important trading partner by far when it comes to food and drink. Today's figures are yet more evidence that protecting this relationship post-Brexit will be key. The rise in the value of UK salmon sales is thanks in part to rising global demand for the fish, that has been hard to meet due to widespread lice infestations that have hampered production. That has led to higher prices for salmon across the board. The weakness of sterling has also helped to make Scottish salmon less expensive than salmon from Chile and Norway. British wine exports saw the greatest growth by volume, climbing 13.8%, while the value of the UK's cheese exports jumped 29.1% to \u00a3145.3m, thanks in part to a spike in sales to France. However, while the weaker pound benefited UK exporters, the FDF said it had also pushed up costs for British businesses that bring food into the UK from abroad. As a result, the UK's food and drink trade deficit - the difference between how much the UK imports and exports - actually widened 19% to \u00a36.2bn in the quarter. Whisky \u00a3895m .

{"article": "Human Rights Watch believes Nato air strikes killed at least 72 civilians and says the organisation needs to bear responsibility where appropriate. \"We're calling for prompt, credible and thorough investigations,\" HRW's Fred Abrahams told BBC News. Nato insists it took unprecedented care to minimise civilian casualties. It argues that it cannot take responsibility because it has had no presence on the ground to confirm the deaths. Aircraft from the US, the UK and France conducted most of the 9,658 strike sorties last year, targeting forces loyal to Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi.

In one instance, it said a first Nato bomb killed 14 people and a second bomb, moments later, killed 18 more who had rushed to help victims.

{"article": "About 14m birds are bred for the table a year. Processing companies are big employers and the industry sustains thousands of jobs on farms and in factories. But poultry has a problem - how to deal with the waste it generates. At the moment, the millions of birds reared in Northern Ireland create 260,000 tonnes of poultry litter a year. The litter is a mix of bedding and droppings and if the industry expands, it could generate 400,000 tonnes of waste annually. For the moment, much of the waste is spread as fertiliser on fields. But it is rich in nitrogen and phosphorous which can run off into rivers and lakes and damage them - a process known as eutrophication. European Union regulations are in place to stop that. To show it is making progress, Northern Ireland needs a long term solution to deal with its poultry waste. The Northern Ireland Executive has set up a \u00a315-20m fund to try to find an answer and soon it will be spending some of that cash. It will be lent to companies who will use it to part fund at least two \"demonstrator\" plants to test new technology. They would be expected to deal with at least 20,000 tonnes of waste a year. Six applications have been assessed by the business development agency, Invest NI. Stormont's Agriculture Minister Michelle O'Neill said at Christmas that schemes based on anaerobic digestion (AD) were furthest advanced in the selection process. Anaerobic digestion uses micro-organisms to break down organic matter inside a sealed and heated system. That gives off a biogas which can be burned to produce heat and power, but there is a problem with using AD technology for this. Unless expensive stripping processes are included, the same amount of nitrogen and phosphorous going into the system in the poultry litter, will be present in the byproduct, or digestate, when it comes out. If you want to spread the digestate on land, you will face the same potential problems with eutrophication. That is why, in 2014, a report commissioned by the agriculture minister said anaerobic digestion was not the answer to the poultry litter problem. However, it seems officials are determined to overcome this issue with the AD projects being assessed for funding. The Department of Agriculture has said that, in those projects, the digestate would either be exported for field spreading or further refined to separate out the nutrients in pellet form. The first loan agreement with Invest NI was expected to be signed by the end of last year. The minister said that once the finance was in place, she expected the first plants could be operational by late 2016 or early 2017.", "abstract": "Poultry meat is big business in Northern Ireland - worth \u00a3205m in 2014.", "candidate": "Northern Ireland is the biggest producer of poultry in the world.", "doc_id": 1619, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Northern Ireland needs a long term solution to deal with its poultry waste.", "evidence": "To show it is making progress, Northern Ireland needs a long term solution to deal with its poultry waste.", "explanation": "the entire summary is made up", "instruction": "Rewrite the summary by mentioning Northern Ireland needs to deal with its poultry waste problem.", "instruction_list": ["Rewrite the summary by mentioning Northern Ireland needs to deal with its poultry waste problem."]}}

Watchful against the threat of Ronaldo cutting inside from Portugal's left, the Reading defender was kept busy by the likes of Renato Sanches and Nani and struggled to influence the game in attack. Switched to the left side of Wales' three centre-backs in Ben Davies' absence, the West Brom man timed his advances well to make interceptions. Beaten by Ronaldo for Portugal's opening goal but won a team-high eight aerial duels. Made some strong early challenges, particularly on Cristiano Ronaldo, to assert his authority on the game. The Swansea City skipper led by example, winning 100% of his 50-50 contests with Portugal players. Making his first international start since March 2015, he competed well in the air as Portugal sought to make the most of Ronaldo's aerial prowess. Wales might have missed Ben Davies' distribution but his replacement was solid defensively. Like Gunter, kept on the back foot by Portugal's attacking players. Pushed forward but, when he got into promising positions, struggled to provide quality crosses. An early booking for a foul on Nani made his job of protecting Wales' defence difficult, but still the Liverpool midfielder buzzed around with intent. Typically sound in possession but not as influential as he has been earlier in the tournament.

{"article": "One of the uprising's leaders said the soldiers were \"ready to fight\" if attacked. Sergeant Seydou Kon\u00e9 said they did not want to negotiate with anyone, according to Reuters news agency. The unrest began after a spokesman for the soldiers announced on Thursday that they had dropped their pay demands. In January, they forced the government into paying them about $8,000 (\u00a36,200) each in bonuses to end a rebellion. They were due to receive a further payment this month and about 8,000 mutineers are unhappy that they were not consulted ahead of Thursday's televised announcement. Three former rebels from the country's civil war era were wounded on Saturday after the mutinous soldiers opened fire in Bouak\u00e9 to stop them staging their own protest, Sergeant Kon\u00e9 said. There have also been reports of injuries after shooting in the northern city of Korhogo. The military chief of staff, General S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9, had threatened \"severe disciplinary sanctions\" on Friday if the uprising did not end. Shops are closed and soldiers are patrolling and firing in the air in Bouak\u00e9, residents said. The mutineers have also taken control of the city of Odienne, in the north, reports say. On Friday, shots were fired in the air at military bases in Abidjan, Bondoukou in the east, Bouak\u00e9 in the centre, and Korhogo. It is believed the mutineers were firing blanks. In response, elite Republican Guard troops in Abidjan fired warning shots that pushed the mutineers back inside the military headquarters compound in Abidjan, Reuters reported. The situation in the city on Saturday was said to be calm. Reacting to the spreading unrest, President Alassane Ouattara held an emergency meeting of the country's security council. The mutiny has raised fears of a resurgence of the violence seen during Ivory Coast's 10-year civil war, which ended in 2011.

{"article": "But in Central European media, the main focus is on the impact of the referendum on benefits for migrant workers in Britain. Germany's n-tv news channel says Boris Johnson's intervention is a \"serious setback\" for the prime minister, despite the mayor's pledge not to go up against Mr Cameron in any television debates. Olivier Bories dubs Mr Johnson the \"man of the moment for Brexit\" in French Catholic daily La Croix, saying that the London mayor is, \"despite his constantly dishevelled blonde mop, a politician to be taken very seriously\". Like other commentators, Mr Bories highlights Mr Johnson's high media profile, but also recalls his record of gaffes at home and abroad. Nonetheless, he does not doubt that his \"carefully timed\" announcement positions him as a possible successor to Mr Cameron in the event of a vote for Brexit. Philippe Bernard, London correspondent of France's left-of-centre Le Monde, agrees that Boris Johnson's \"defiance\" of David Cameron gives a \"potentially decisive impetus\" to the Brexit campaign and could see him oust the prime minister. He rates Mr Johnson's role as important, but also considers his \"capricious personality and unpredictable political opportunism irritating to the British public\" and perhaps a \"threat\" to the Conservative Party and the country itself. Alessandra Rizzo in Italy's liberal La Stampa is not alone in rehearsing the personal rivalry between the prime minister and mayor, whom she dubs \"perhaps the most popular politician in the country\", but goes further than most in ranging them against one another in a \"new Battle of Britain\". \"Expect four months of intense, even heavy skirmishes\" between the two Conservatives ahead of the June vote, she concludes. Russia's pro-Kremlin NTV channel uses an even more heated analogy, dubbing Boris Johnson's move \"a stab in the back\". In Hungary, the Nepszabadsag daily is gloomy about the impact of the UK referendum on developments at home. If Mr Cameron prevails, it concludes, \"Hungarians working in Britain can say goodbye to part of their welfare benefits... but they lose even more if supporters of quitting win\". Tomasz Bielecki, Brussels correspondent of Poland's liberal Gazeta Wyborcza, agrees that migrant workers like the Poles \"will pay most for Mr Cameron's compromise\", but concludes that \"if it keeps Britain in the EU, it's a price worth paying\". A British exit would weaken the European Union, especially in its dealings with Russia, and possibly lead to a \"nightmare domino effect\" with other countries departing, he fears. Mr Bielecki says the prime minister's best hope is to focus on the overall advantages of the European Union rather than letting his opponents sidetrack the debate into \"marginal issues - including the Brussels deal\". Other commentators agree that the referendum has implications far beyond British politics. Jochen Buchsteiner in Germany's centre-right Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung notes that Conservative Brexit campaigners are pitching their appeal on the \"primacy of national sovereignty\". They may well start asking whether Germany will demand concessions from Britain on refugees in return for the Brussels deal, which he says \"owed much\" to Chancellor Angela Merkel. His concern is that a European Union still dominated by immigration, the euro crisis and \"political helplessness\" in June might persuade many voters that EU exit would not be a \"leap in the dark\" but rather a case of \"stepping into the light\". Legal analyst Araceli Mangas also has concerns about the referendum, in Spain's conservative El Pais. He writes that Britain remaining in the EU \"matters a great deal\", and a win for Brexit would \"encourage all sorts of populists\".

{"article": "Brian Steele, 13 at the time of the 1989 tragedy, said he did not see 15-year-old Philip after the crush began. A nurse, who tried to help at least six casualties, also told the inquests he asked for oxygen which never came. Ninety-six football fans were fatally injured at the Liverpool versus Nottingham Forest FA Cup semi-final. The 200th day of the new inquests heard Philip and Brian Steele, from Southport, went to watch the match with their mother and father, Dolores and Leslie, who had tickets for the seated area above the Leppings Lane terraces. Altar boy Philip was described by his mother as having a \"lovely smile\". She said she \"never heard her son say a bad word about anyone\". The brothers were seen on CCTV going through the turnstiles at 13:52 BST. They had left their parents shortly after arriving in Sheffield to secure a good spot to watch the match. Part of Brian's 1989 witness statement was read to the court, in which he said: \"It was as the players were coming out or just prior to the players coming out that the first crush started. \"At this time Philip was with me. I was pushed towards the goal in this crush. I don't know what happened to Philip and I didn't see him after the first crush. \"There were people all around me and I couldn't see anything. I had to put my head up to breathe and all I could see was the sky.\" Brian Steele said he did not know how long the crush lasted, but eventually the pressure released and he made his way out. He added that during the crush he \"started to fall to the floor\" before someone grabbed his jumper. \"For quite some time my feet weren't on the floor by the person holding my jumper and other people keeping me up.\" Philip was taken out of the pen and given first aid on the pitch. Nurse John Boyle said he worked with a St John Ambulance volunteer to try to resuscitate Philip but after \"three or four minutes\" he decided there was nothing more he could do. The jury heard David Thomas, 23, travelled to Sheffield with friends, including brothers Christopher and Kevin Traynor, who also died. The jury also saw a picture of Mr Thomas, a joiner from Birkenhead, among the crowd in pen three timed between 15:06 and 15:08. He was given treatment on the pitch by David Evans, a charge nurse and senior ward manager from Liverpool, and Dr William Purcell, Sheffield Wednesday's club doctor. In a statement, Mr Evans said he and Dr Purcell worked on at least six casualties on the pitch and \"one or two\" started breathing again. Summarising his statement, Christina Lambert QC, for the coroner, said: \"He says he and Dr Purcell asked for oxygen tanks but were unable to get any during this time.\" BBC footage from the day showed Mr Evans and Dr Purcell working on Mr Thomas between at least 15:26 and 15:33, when he was put into an ambulance. The medic on board said by the time he saw him, \"unfortunately there was no chance\" of saving him. Another casualty who was breathing was put into the vehicle and treated as a priority. Both Mr Thomas and Philip Steele were taken to the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield. Their bodies were later brought back to the stadium where their families identified them.

They are calling for action by the Scottish and UK governments to protect the industry and its jobs. About 400 marchers set off at 11:00 from the Dalzell works, heading to Ravenscraig for a rally. Up to 270 jobs could be lost after Tata Steel announced plans to mothball the plants along with 900 posts at the firm's facility in Scunthorpe. A total of 225 jobs are threatened at the Dalzell plate-rolling works in Motherwell, along with 45 posts at the Clydebridge plant in Cambuslang. The company blames cheap Chinese imports and high energy costs for a collapse in steel prices. The Scottish government has assembled a taskforce to try to guarantee a future for the plants. Community union representative Derek Fearon said: \"We are trying to raise awareness of the campaign, and hopefully through this Tata will become a responsible seller. \"The main aim of the taskforce, the priority of it, is for the two plants to remain open. \"The mood is upbeat, the guys are still positive that everything can be done for the two plants to be saved.\" The Scottish government has pledged to do everything possible to keep the plants operational, with its preferred option being to find a buyer. However, ministers have not ruled out moves to bring both facilities under public ownership. A Scottish Steel Task Force, chaired by business minister Fergus Ewing, and including representatives from trade unions and Tata, as well as local councils, met last week to discuss the way forward. Motherwell and Wishaw MSP John Pentland, himself a former steelworker, has welcomed the creation of the task force and called for all avenues to be explored to keep the plants open. He said: \"The starting point for the Scottish Task Force should be saving the steel plants and all the jobs, not softening the blow. \"We should not meekly accept the annihilation of the Scottish steel industry.

{"article": "Reports of a \"mass murder\" investigation in France and pictures of German policemen carting bags of evidence from his parents' home suggest that officials are determined to find out. But this appears to be a case of murder-suicide, which is very different and extremely rare. In these incidents, one person wishing to end their life takes the lives of others - in this case, complete strangers - at the same time. The statistics show that most murder-suicides happen in domestic settings, and involve a man and his spouse. Murder-suicides involving pilots or in gun massacres are, in fact, much, much rarer. What drives people to these acts is therefore virtually impossible to determine because there is no common theme and the perpetrators don't leave notes explaining their actions. In contrast to the motivations of a suicide bomber, which are intentionally well-publicised, those behind a murder-suicide are usually more difficult to fathom. No-one, of course, can pretend to know what was in Lubitz's mind as he locked the cockpit door and instigated the plane's devastating descent. Simon Wessely, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says it's unlikely we will ever know. \"It's possible something will emerge, but in most suicides people leave clues or a message. \"Incredibly extreme events like this are sometimes just inexplicable.\" Despite this, the media has been quick to point the finger at Lubitz's history of depression. German newspapers have also reported that he had received psychiatric treatment and may have been experiencing a \"personal life crisis\". In reality, there is a multitude of factors, feelings and personality traits which could push someone to such an extreme course of action. Alcohol problems, drug misuse, broken relationships or marriages, personality disorders, work stresses - in the past or at the time of the act - can all play a part. Mental health charities agree, and have been queuing up to plead for more understanding about depression, and less sensationalist language. They say the vast majority of people with depression do not hurt anyone, and research shows that their risk is primarily to themselves. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of mental health charity Sane, says: \"There are thousands of people with a diagnosis of depression, including pilots, who work, hold positions of high responsibility and who present no danger whatsoever. \"We do not know what part depression played in this tragedy but it is a condition that should never be trivialised.\" Charities said there was a danger that mental health problems could be stigmatised by coverage of the crash, making people more afraid to talk about their experiences. Dr Paul Keedwell, consultant psychiatrist and specialist in mood disorders, also says mental health problems are not a sufficient explanation for what happened. \"Among cases of murder-suicide in general, the rate of previously diagnosed depression varies from 40% to 60%, depending on the context.\" But he does say that of those who are depressed, very few are being treated for it. It is clear that men find it particularly difficult to seek help if they have a history of mental illness. In the UK, for example, 75% of suicides are in men. Lubitz passed the tests set by his employer which indicated he was fit to fly, but it has since come to light that he may have been hiding an illness from them. This illness and his seeming inability to talk about it or come to terms with it may hold some small clue to his actions. But, in reality, there is never going to be an adequate explanation for murder-suicides - particularly for the families of those killed.", "abstract": "The question has been raised - is 27-year-old Andreas Lubitz a mass murderer for bringing down a plane full of passengers, killing everyone on board?", "candidate": "What drove Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz to deliberately crash his plane into the French Alps, killing himself and 149 others?", "doc_id": 1635, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "What drove airplane pilot Lubitz to deliberately crash his plane into the ground killing himself and the passengers?", "evidence": "No-one, of course, can pretend to know what was in Lubitz's mind as he locked the cockpit door and instigated the plane's devastating descent.", "explanation": "The summary is mostly hallucinated information:  (1) the name of Mr. Lubitz' employer was not mentioned by the source text; (2) the first name of Mr. Lubitz was not mentioned by the source text; (3) the source text does not mention that the plane crashed into the French Alps; (4) the number dead was not reported by the source text; (5) Mr. Lubitz is mentioned as the co-pilot in the summary but that is not mentioned by the source text and at the time of the crash he was piloting the plane.", "instruction": "Remove the information about Mr. Lubitz' employer from the summary.

{"article": "The Liberal Democrat chief secretary to the treasury aims to introduce a new offence for firms that fail to act to prevent economic crime. Mr Alexander told the Andrew Marr show he wants organisations that encourage or facilitate tax evasion to face the same penalties as evaders themselves. The proposed crackdown comes in the wake of HSBC tax-dodging allegations. It emerged earlier this month that the bank had allegedly helped hundreds of people evade UK tax using hidden HSBC accounts in Geneva. Former director of public prosecutions Lord Ken Macdonald said the bank had left itself open to criminal charges in the UK and there were strong grounds to investigate the bank for \"cheating\" HM Revenue and Customs. He added that HMRC's decision not to prosecute was \"seriously flawed\". Mr Alexander said: \"We should create a new offence of corporate failure to avoid preventing an economic crime and also that organisations who facilitate or encourage evasion should face the same penalty as the evaders themselves.\" He described it as a \"Liberal Democrat idea\" but intends to try to push the proposals through before May's general election. If he cannot, they will form a key part of the Lib Dem manifesto. \"Organisations, be they accountants, banks or whatever, who help people evade tax will be liable for this new offence and crucially liable for financial penalties,\" he added. There's been more comment about facilitating tax evasion in the fortnight since the Panorama programme on HSBC than in the five years before that. Danny Alexander's new plan to make it a crime for banks and accountants to look the other way while their clients knowingly evade tax may appear to be a populist reaction - very late in the life of this coalition. The public may feel it's better late than never though. They see benefit fraudsters brought before the courts and small firms harangued by the tax man for modest VAT bills while giant firms and high net worth individuals know it's unlikely they'll be prosecuted for not paying all their taxes. Making the professional advisers pay the same fine as their clients will also send a chill down the spine of many of the big four accountants and all of the banks. Danny Alexander concedes it might be a big ask to get a new law through Parliament making inaction in the face of tax evasion a crime but the Lib Dems will try. He says there's a much better chance of bolting on the financial penalties side of his proposal to next month's Budget though. And he may even get cross-party support. Mr Alexander continued: \"So, for example, if their customers have to pay back hundreds of millions of pounds in tax then those organisations should have to match that with hundreds of millions of pounds of their own money and I think that's a very tough disincentive to them to get involved in this in the first place. \"This is taboo. This is something that absolutely mustn't happen in our society and we still have a problem with some people thinking they can get away without paying their fair share of tax.\" The Lib Dems said they would make a commitment to see the \"tax gap\" - the difference between the total owed to the Exchequer and the amount collected - fall in each year of the next Parliament. The party would also strengthen codes of practice which apply to tax-advising professions. Mr Alexander said in a statement that \"these cheats and their accomplices are effectively stealing from all of us\", adding: \"These new measures will build on the successful strategy that is making tax evasion as socially unacceptable as benefit fiddling or drinking and driving.\" Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: \"Nobody will believe these warm words when Danny Alexander and the Lib Dems have broken their promises on tax. \"Along with the Tories they have totally failed to tackle tax avoidance and cut taxes for millionaires while raising VAT on families and pensioners.\"", "abstract": "Companies that fail to prevent tax evasion could face penalties as part of plans announced by Danny Alexander.", "candidate": "Accountants, banks and other firms that help people evade tax should face financial penalties, Danny Alexander has said.", "doc_id": 1643, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "\"Organisations, be they accountants, banks or whatever, who help people evade tax will be liable for this new offence and crucially liable for financial penalties,\" he added.", "explanation": "This is very true and exactly what was said by Danny Alexander in the source.

The 2015 review was confidential, but a copy of the report has been exclusively obtained by the Western Telegraph. It revealed a head of service initially failed to provide information of child protection concerns about Smith. Pembrokeshire council said \"it is unfortunate that a member of the authority has seen fit to disclose the report, contrary to advice\". Smith, from Haverfordwest, was employed as a youth worker for the council between May 2001 and January 2012. During that time he was the subject of three disciplinary hearings. Allegations against him included allowing a child to sit on his lap and drive his Land Rover, allowing a child to sit in his Land Rover without wearing a seatbelt, and a young person, who had been reported missing by their foster carer, had shown up at his home. The report, which was compiled by an independent social worker, said Smith \"displayed many grooming behaviours during the years he was employed by Pembrokeshire council but there were no direct allegations of abuse during this time\". Smith was dismissed for gross misconduct and in September 2013 a police investigation began after he was accused of sexually abusing a boy. He was jailed for six years in July 2014 after admitting sexually assaulting a child under the age of 13, inciting the child to engage in sexual activity and taking indecent photographs of the child. He also admitted possessing 1,136 indecent images of children. The report said in 2010 Smith had applied to Pembrokeshire council to become a respite foster carer. The fostering team wrote to the Head of Youth Service for his views on Smith's application. The report said the head of service had \"replied in very positive terms\". A formal reference form which the head of service was sent asked him to \"highlight any concerns\" regarding Smith's employment, including any disciplinary proceedings and the outcomes. The head of service left the section blank. It was not until the papers were distributed to the foster panel that one of the members recalled Smith had been investigated previously for inappropriate behaviour with children and had been disciplined. The panel concluded Smith was not suitable for approval to be a foster carer. \"By withholding relevant information and leaving the section of the form blank, the foster panel might have concluded that there had been no concerns and no disciplinary action,\" the report said. \"It was only chance that a member of the fostering panel recollected the safeguarding investigation in 2005\" and \"only luck that prevented Smith from being approved as a foster carer\". There have been calls to make the report public. The latest request took place at full council on 2 March when Cllr Mike Stoddart had put forward a notice of motion asking for it to be published. He said it is in \"the public interest to publish the report so that the electorate can be fully apprised of the chain of events surrounding this issue.\" His motion was defeated by a single vote. A statement from Pembrokeshire council said: \"The report contains personal information in relation to children, parents and professionals, and the report was made available to members on this basis. Further publication of this report was restricted. \"On making the report available to all members, they were made aware that there are families in the area who remain affected by the actions of Mr Smith, and were reminded of their corporate obligation to safeguard everyone in the community.\"", "abstract": "An ex-youth worker jailed for child sex offences could have been approved as a foster carer, a case review has found.", "candidate": "A former youth worker who was jailed for sexually abusing a boy was refused permission to become a foster carer, a report has revealed.", "doc_id": 1646, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "He was jailed for six years in July 2014 after admitting sexually assaulting a child under the age of 13, inciting the child to engage in sexual activity and taking indecent photographs of the child.", "explanation": "He was jailed and was also refused to become a foster carer as well, so that is accurate.

{"article": "The jury ruled that neither sheriff's officials nor jailers committed a crime in their treatment of Bland. It has not yet been determined whether the police officer who arrested her should face charges, a prosecutor said. The 28-year-old African-American was arrested after a confrontation with a policeman who had pulled her car over. She was found dead three days later. In recent years, the deaths of black Americans in police custody have caused much debate and protests in the US. Police say that Ms Bland hanged herself while being held in the Waller County jail. The family have denied that she was suicidal and have accused the jail of being \"reckless\" in disregarding her safety and failing to keep her free from harm. The Waller County grand jury would return in January to consider whether to indict police officer Brian Encinia, who arrested Ms Bland in July, prosecutor Darrell Jordan said. A video of the arrest shows Mr Encinia giving Ms Bland a warning. The situation quickly escalates, with Mr Encinia appearing to threaten Ms Bland after she refuses to get out of her car. He unsuccessfully tries to pull her out and tells her \"I will light you up\". Ms Bland's family has alleged Mr Encinia falsified an assault allegation to take her into custody. An attorney representing Ms Bland's family, Cannon Lambert, said on Monday that the grand jury's decision was consistent with what the family believed was an attempt by authorities to cover up the events surrounding Ms Bland's death. \"They continue to do things we are disappointed in,\" he said. Ms Bland's sister Shante Needham has said Sandra had called her from jail, saying she did not know why she had been arrested and that an officer had possibly broken her arm. Ms Bland died by asphyxiation after using a plastic bag to hang herself in her cell, according to Waller County District Attorney Elton Mathias. Video footage from the jail did not show what happened inside Ms Bland's cell, but did suggest no-one entered or left it until someone found her unconscious. Mr Mathis has said there is nothing in that investigation \"that shows anything happened but she killed herself\".", "abstract": "A grand jury has decided not to indict anyone in the case of Sandra Bland, who died in a Texas jail earlier this year.", "candidate": "A Texas grand jury has decided not to charge anyone over the death in jail of Sandra Bland, who was found dead in July.", "doc_id": 1653, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "A  grand jury has decided not to charge any of the jailers over the death in jail of Sandra Bland, who was found dead after her arrest in July ..", "evidence": "The Waller County grand jury would return in January to consider whether to indict police officer Brian Encinia, who arrested Ms Bland in July, prosecutor Darrell Jordan said.", "explanation": "The summary has misinterpreted that the jury had decided no one should be charged because the source information states that the y will return to decide if the arresting officer will be charged.

{"article": "They introduced it 10 years ago when the West African country was suffering from a shortfall of nurses as many headed off for better opportunities in the West. It began a scheme funding the education of nurses who then had to agree to work for the next five years in Ghana. But now the government says it has enough nurses and it is no longer useful to keep them under bond. \"There are now more private schools churning out nurses and some of them can't even find jobs,\" Dr Kwesi Abir, the health ministry's deputy director of human resources, told the BBC. \"There is no point to continue to pay the tuition of nurses and also give allowances when hundreds are paying their own fees in private schools,\" he said. The policy reversal is unlikely to lead to an immediate exodus of nurses because although the bond scheme stopped taking new entrants last year, it takes four years to qualify as a nurse and those already in the scheme will have to finish their five-year service. If a nurse wants to jump the bond there is penalty of $650 (\u00c2\u00a3422) to pay for each uncompleted year, something very few can afford to do. And the authorities will not issue certificates that will enable them to work abroad unless the fine is paid. Student nurse Collins Aboagye says he is in that position - even though he would love to work in the UK after qualifying, he will not be able to. \"I think the five years is too much\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I wish to work outside because outside, there are certain things their way of delivering care is a bit different from ours here.\" This is a sentiment - a desire for job satisfaction - that is echoed at the country's premiere hospital, the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in the capital, Accra. Nurses can be seen under pressure as they attend to patients in the maternity ward - a large hall with about 100 benches filled with women awaiting for antenatal services. Some of them are impatient, demanding to be seen more quickly. One of the major difficulties in providing good healthcare is not just the number of healthcare professionals but the fact that hospitals are ill equipped, nurses told the BBC. They say there are insufficient protective plastic gloves, not enough hospital beds for patients, a lack of water and chemicals, frequent power outages - their list is endless. However, salaries are likely to still be a driving factor for nurses to go abroad given Ghana's rising cost of living. According to the UK's National Health Service, a newly qualified nurse starts on a salary of more than \u00c2\u00a321,000 a year - with opportunities to earn overtime - that is, at least $2,695 a month. A professional nurse in Ghana earns about $400 a month after tax - and nurses often face the frustration of delays in the payment of their salaries. Salma Razak, a nurse at Korle Bu who just finished serving her bond, is free now to work abroad, but she remains undecided. She says although the government has improved some things for nurses, much more could be done. \"From the beginning, you can start by paying us hourly, not monthly - in that way salaries will be much more,\" she told the BBC. This would stop nurses being tempted to seek employment elsewhere, she said. Ghana currently has a little more than 20,000 professional nurses. Each year about 400 enter the job market but in 2004 almost twice that number - 700 nurses - left to work in the UK. Ghana's health ministry says these numbers have dramatically declined with only about 300 nurses leaving in the last two years. Behind the numbers, there are grave concerns about the quality of healthcare delivery. And there is a down side for students from poorer backgrounds who will no longer be able to benefit from the government-funded scheme. But with the brain drain stemmed, health officials are optimistic that the funds used in nurse training can now be used to address long waiting hours and improve hospitals.", "abstract": "Ghana's government has scrapped a controversial ban on newly qualified nurses travelling to find more lucrative employment abroad.", "candidate": "Ghana's government has scrapped its bond scheme for nurses.", "doc_id": 1654, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "But now the government says it has enough nurses and it is no longer useful to keep them under bond.", "explanation": "it correctly pulls the info (Ghana, nurses, bond scheme, scrapped) from the source text", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

{"article": "The imagery, released by US geopolitical intelligence company Stratfor and taken on 31 October, shows how almost all the buildings at the airport, on the southern outskirts of Mosul, have been razed. Runways have also been damaged, with wide trenches carved into them and rubble placed along their lengths, Stratfor's analysis says. Taxiways and aprons - where aircraft park - have also been sabotaged. About 50,000 Iraqi security forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen, assisted by US-led coalition airstrikes, are currently involved in a military offensive to reclaim Mosul from IS militants. Government forces have already retaken dozens of villages and towns surrounding the city and are currently consolidating gains made in Mosul's eastern outskirts. The damage to the runways has rendered the airport worthless as an asset for attacking forces, says Stratfor. Airports or runways are typically a primary objective for assaults on cities, since control over them can deny or enable logistical capabilities, having a considerable impact on the outcome of battles. However, IS militants have ensured there is little left for approaching forces to gain by taking the site, Stratfor says. IS employed a similar tactic at Qayyarah air base, 70km (43 miles) south of Mosul. However, the trenches dug there only partially covered the main runway, Stratfor says, and it was restored to service within months of the Iraqi forces recapturing the base in July. By comparison, Mosul airport's destruction could be much more difficult to repair. Mirroring the demolition at Qayyarah, IS fighters have also levelled almost every structure at Mosul airport. Stratfor says that as well as preventing Iraqi forces and their allies from using the facilities, the tactic also serves to clear the line of sight for IS defensive positions on the northern edge of the airport. Along with restoring the runways, Iraqi forces would need to rebuild hangars, warehouses and other infrastructure in order to use it as a logistical base. In contrast to the widespread destruction elsewhere in the area, the images show how the city's sugar factory remains relatively intact - testimony to its utility to IS. After the jihadists captured Mosul in June 2014, they continued to operate the factory, says Stratfor, and more than a year later, executed the plant's manager when she refused to run it for them. However, the images also show how coalition airstrikes, aimed at destroying key IS positions and assets, have caused some damage to the buildings.

He was speaking in support of an amendment that insists that no hard border is put in place between NI and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. The amendment proposed by former Northern Ireland Secretary Lord Hain stated that an open border must continue in line with the provisions of the 1998 Belfast Agreement. After hearing government assurances during the debate, Lord Hain later withdrew his amendment. Lord Hain, who was Northern Ireland secretary of state from 2005 until 2007, said: \"If we get this wrong, for the UK, it may be perilous. For Northern Ireland it could be politically lethal.\" Lord Alderdice, a Liberal Democrat peer who voted Remain in last year's referendum, said that Mrs May must not view the issue of the border as if she was still home secretary. He added that it was his fear that the government was looking at this with \"the approach of the Home Office\". He also called on Mrs May to approach the issue of the border with \"imagination\" and \"political creativity\". In response, Lord Trimble, the former Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader who sits on the Conservative benches, rejected the amendment supported by Lord Alderdice and Lord Hain. Lord Trimble told peers he did not believe the amendment was necessary. He said: \"The amendment is asking the Prime Minster to support the maintenance of the open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. \"The Prime Minister does that as of now. It is in the White Paper. It is not necessary.\" Former Conservative minister, Lord Howell, supported Lord Trimble's position on the amendment. Former UUP leader, Lord Empey, said the amendment was \"misplaced\". He told his fellow peers that he agreed totally with \"an open free border\". However, he called on the government to give an assurance that \"there will be no internal border in the UK\". Baroness O'Loan told a packed chamber that she opposed the amendment. She said it would not \"benefit the UK\" and that the issue of the border should be \"dealt with in the negotiations\". Lord Kilclooney, the former Ulster Unionist MP, also opposed the amendment and told the house that the \"southern Irish were petrified about Brexit\". Earlier, Lord Hain said Brexit could cause \"profound damage\" to the peace process and warned that a return to checkpoints along the border would sew division and discontent. Responding for the government, Lord Dunlop said there was no need for Lord Hain's amendment. He said the \"government's intentions are clear\" and that no undertaking was \"necessary\". The peer, who represents the Northern Ireland Office, added that maintaining the Common Travel Area with the Republic of Ireland \"will be a priority\". He said the government is seeking \"practical solutions\" to achieve as \"frictionless a border as possible\". At the end of the debate, Lord Hain withdrew his amendment.

Hamilton was 0.838secs quicker than Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, who was also 0.478secs behind Rosberg. The margin between the cars was such that Ferrari decided not to bother doing a second run in the final session of qualifying because they accepted they could not beat the Mercedes and preferred to save a set of tyres for the race. On the face of it, that suggests Mercedes are as far ahead of Ferrari as they were last year. But Hamilton was actually even further ahead of Vettel in qualifying in Australia last year and the German won the next race in Malaysia.

A review of school transport policy has also been promised before the end of 2017/18. Councillor Sandy Aitchison said: \"The principle of the school estate review is to look at our buildings and locations with a view to increasing educational opportunities, improving outcomes for children and young people and ensuring that our school estate is sustainable, affordable and suitable for the future. \"The pre-consultation with parents, pupils and communities has given us a 'warts and all' assessment of our schools from these key stakeholders. \"Going forward, these views will be taken into account in the next stage of our discussions and in the formal proposals we will take out to public consultation. \"The school estate review as a whole, and the actions identified following the specific consultations to take place, are not going to be an overnight process and we are committed to fully engaging with parents, pupils, staff and wider community as we progress with the review over the coming months and years.\"", "abstract": "Scottish Borders Council is set to start the first phase of a wide-ranging overhaul of its schools provision across the region.", "candidate": "Scottish Borders Council is planning a major review of its school estate.", "doc_id": 1670, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "A council is planning a major review of its school estate.", "evidence": "The local authority is carrying out the review against a background of \"ongoing financial challenges\".", "explanation": "The name \"Scottish Borders Council\" is not supported.", "instruction": "Replace the information about Scottish Borders Council with the information about A council.", "instruction_list": ["Replace the information about Scottish Borders Council with the information about A council."]}}
{"article": "After Katie Zelem's first-minute opener for Liverpool, goals from Karen Carney, Fran Kirby, Drew Spence and Eniola Aluko put Chelsea 4-1 up at half-time. Caroline Weir and Emma Lundh's second-half strikes gave the visitors hope. But Kirby and Spence both added goals to restore the three-goal lead and keep pressure on leaders Manchester City. Zelem, who netted twice in Liverpool's 3-2 loss at Notts County last time out, stunned the defending champions with a fine strike from range in the early stages. But the floodgates opened after England winger Carney rounded the goalkeeper to level and the scoreline could have been bigger as Carney struck the crossbar with a free-kick late on. Chelsea - who won 2-1 at Liverpool in their previous match - remain second, three points behind first-placed City, who have played a game more.

{"article": "Lewis Hamilton was the fastest of the silver cars, despite a mistake-strewn final lap on a weekend when penalties mean he will start from the back. Team-mate Nico Rosberg, who has a golden opportunity to close the title race deficit, was 0.107secs slower. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was second fastest, followed by Sebastian Vettel. Mercedes have so far not shown their true pace on an unusual weekend that has been dominated by Hamilton's engine penalties - which amount to 55 places following three engine changes, meaning he will start right at the back - and problems with tyre choices caused by the unexpected heat. Spa-Francorchamps is more usually associated with unpredictable and often wet weather, even in August, but this weekend has been baking, with temperatures in the low 30Cs. That means the tyres are suffering - a problem exacerbated by the fact that greater freedom for the teams in tyre choices than previously this year has meant they have leaned towards softer tyres. The super-soft tyre has never been brought to Spa before, because of the demands of its many long, high-speed corners. But Ferrari picked seven sets of the tyre out of their available 13, and only one of the more durable medium. Mercedes have gone the other way, splitting their choices much more evenly between the super-soft, soft and medium. That meant, with only four sets of the super-soft available, Mercedes did not use it at all until the final minutes of the session. It was not immediately clear why Rosberg was 0.768secs off Raikkonen's pace, but Hamilton had a lift in the fast double-left hander at Pouhon and then made mistakes at flat-out Blanchimont and on the entry to the final chicane. Mercedes executive director (technical) Paddy Lowe told BBC Sport that the team were likely to give Hamilton only the least possible running in qualifying - probably meaning only one run in the first session - because of his penalties. \"We'll probably just run the minimum necessary in qualifying,\" Lowe said. \"We want to give Lewis the strongest possible race from the back and with the maximum number of tyres.\" Rosberg, despite his lack of headline pace in the final practice session, is expected to take pole, and there will be a tight battle between Red Bull and Ferrari for best of the rest. Ricciardo's team-mate Max Verstappen, who was fastest on Friday afternoon, did only two laps on Saturday before being hit by a gearbox problem. Hamilton is not the only driver with engine penalties. McLaren's Fernando Alonso, who was 11th fastest and two places ahead of team-mate Jenson Button in the session, has a 35-place penalty and Sauber's Marcus Ericsson 10 places.

The prison service said the Victim Information Scheme (PRVIS) gives victims an opportunity to provide and receive information about prisoners. Miss Fleming went missing in April 1998. Her body parts were found under the foundations of a partially-built house eight weeks later. Sentencing Scott in 2000, the judge described him as \"thoroughly evil\". He said: \"The manner in which her body was disposed of after her murder is surely the most gruesome. \"I am satisfied that you, Scott, not only deliberately killed this young girl but that you planned that killing and carried it out in circumstances so squalid that they would revolt any right-thinking person.\" Her sister, Josie Fleming, told BBC Radio Foyle she was contacted by someone who had spotted the killer painting a fence. \"Even though we knew the time was coming we are angry and fearful,\" she said. \"They need to let us know when he is due for his official release - it's important for us to know when this evil person will be free to walk the streets.\" Miss Fleming said she believes Scott is \"capable of anything\" and should never be freed. \"He took her into his flat, he tied her up in a bed and put a blindfold over her eyes and covered her mouth with tape,\" Ms Fleming said. \"He injected her with insulin and when she passed away he put her in the attic and then took her down and put her in the bath to cut her up.\" \"You never can come to terms with what happened, we're learning to live with it but we'll never, ever get over it.\" In a statement, the prison service said those who register with the Victim Information Scheme will get details about a person convicted of a crime against them.

{"article": "Lord Keen - the UK's government's Advocate General - said triggering Article 50 would not alter the \"essential structure\" of devolution. The Scottish government believes Holyrood should be consulted before talks between the UK and EU begin. But Lord Keen said that was \"fatally undermined\" by powers over foreign affairs being reserved to Westminster. He was speaking as the UK's highest court heard a second day of argument in the historic Brexit legal challenge. The Scottish government's top law officer, Lord Advocate James Wolffe, is due to put the case for Holyrood having a say in the triggering of Article 50 later this week. Lord Keen told the panel of 11 judges that it was plain from the legislation setting up the Scottish Parliament that it had no authority over matters of international relations, such as EU membership. As a result, he suggested devolution arguments could not be used to \"qualify or abrogate\" the UK government's right to exercise powers to trigger Article 50. He said: \"I would submit these reservations are fatal to reliance on devolution legislation as giving rise to any necessary implication, or indeed any other indication, that the government cannot exercise its foreign affairs and treaty prerogative in the ordinary way.\" Pressed by Supreme Court President Lord Neuberger if he was saying \"the answer is the same in Scotland as it is here (in the UK as a whole), Lord Keen replied that \"essentially\" it was. Lord Keen went on to argue that the Sewel convention was a \"political\" accord and should not be seen as a legal obstacle to the UK government exercising its powers with regard to EU exit without reference to the Scottish Parliament. The Sewel convention was an important component of the 1998 Scottish devolution settlement, which stipulated that Westminster would not normally legislate on devolved matters in Scotland without the consent of the Scottish Parliament. But Lord Keen said it was a political convention concerning the legislative functions of the Westminster Parliament, and was \"never intended to be a justiciable legal principle\". Pressed by Lord Sumption on whether he believed that the convention's incorporation into an act of Parliament makes \"no legal difference to its effect\", Lord Keen replied \"yes\". James Eadie QC, for the UK government, had earlier continued his attempt to persuade the Supreme Court justices to rule in its favour over its planned strategy for exiting the European Union. He is urging the panel to overturn a ruling against the government by the High Court in London last month. The Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas and two other judges decided that Prime Minister Theresa May lacked power to use the royal prerogative to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty and start the two-year process of negotiating Brexit without the prior authority of Parliament. Long before the start of the second day of the appeal on Tuesday, members of the public joined a lengthy queue in the hope of getting a place inside the court to witness the proceedings.

{"article": "The operation took four hours. IS continued to fire mortars at the airport from further inside the city after losing the ground to the army. The jihadists have also entered a nearby military base amid further clashes, a military spokesman said. Eastern Mosul was retaken last month. The airport's runway has been destroyed by IS, but BBC Middle East Correspondent Quentin Sommerville, who is embedded with Iraqi federal police units, says it still has value. It's a large piece of land, and controlling it will help secure southern routes to west Mosul, our correspondent says. The assault began with overnight air strikes by the US-led coalition before armoured columns advanced to the airport's perimeter. An Iraqi lieutenant was killed by one of the roadside bombs planted in the area by IS, the BBC has learned. Iraqi forces also came under fire from IS militants who had holed up inside airport buildings, reports said. Foreign troops from the US-led coalition were with the attacking troops, officials told AP, without specifying their nationality. The airport and the al-Ghazlani base are on Mosul's southern outskirts on the western side of the Tigris river. Thousands of Iraqi troops, backed by artillery and air power, are involved in the assault to retake Mosul. Leaflets warning residents of an imminent offensive were earlier dropped over western Mosul, where military officials say narrow winding streets could make retaking the area particularly difficult. Although slightly smaller than the east, western Mosul is more densely populated and includes districts seen as pro-IS. The UN has voiced concern about the welfare of civilians trapped in the city, amid reports that they could number up to 650,000. More than 160,000 people have already fled their homes in and around the city. The UN said in late January that almost half of all the casualties in Mosul were civilians.

After Ghailani's acquittal on that and other charges, Congress barred US President Barack Obama from moving Guantanamo prisoners to the US. The charges related to the 1998 bombing of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. In New York on Tuesday, Judge Lewis Kaplan rejected Ghailani's request for leniency, saying any mistreatment he claimed he had suffered at the hands of his captors \"pales in comparison to the suffering and the horror he and his confederates caused\". \"This crime was so horrible,\" he said. \"It was a cold-blooded killing and maiming of innocent people on an enormous scale.\" US Attorney General Eric Holder said the life sentence demonstrated the ability of the US justice system to hold terrorists accountable for their actions. \"We hope this life sentence brings some measure of justice to the victims of these attacks and their families and friends who have waited so long for this day,\" he said in a statement. By Laura TrevelyanBBC News, New York . While the conviction was not the resounding one the justice department would have liked, Ghailani's life imprisonment has been seized upon by the US Attorney General Eric Holder as showing the strength of the country's courts. But it's hard to see when the next civilian trial of a Guantanamo detainee will be, or indeed when President Barack Obama can close the Guantanamo Bay military prison. In the weeks following the Ghailani verdict late last year, Congress passed a law which prevented military funds from being used to transfer Guantanamo inmates to the US. This makes it practically very difficult for the Obama administration to empty the detention centre, and to move detainees and try them in civilian courts. \"As this case demonstrates, we will not rest in bringing to justice terrorists who seek to harm the American people, and we will use every tool available to the government to do so.\" Ahead of the sentencing, Ghailani had asked for leniency, saying he had never intended to kill anyone and that he had been tortured. In 2001 four co-conspirators were sentenced to life in prison over the August 1998 bombings, in which 224 people were killed. Prosecutors said Ghailani had conspired with al-Qaeda operatives to bomb the embassies, and helped buy the explosives that destroyed the US embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. US investigators said Ghailani had flown to Pakistan the night before the simultaneous bombings. He was indicted in the US in December 1998 but remained at large in Afghanistan and the Waziristan area of Pakistan, the US says.

Giving evidence at Holyrood, Assistant Chief Constable Bernie Higgins said armed officers were among the best trained in the force. But he accepted police intelligence could sometimes get it wrong. Assistant Chief Constable Higgins told Holyrood's justice sub-committee that during a recent incident in Edinburgh two armed officers were confronted with a man wielding a knife. One was stabbed four times, he said, but the officers did not shoot the attacker because they feared it would put members of the public standing nearby at risk.

But he also confirmed that they had issued fixed penalties for public urination, drinking in the street and breach of the peace.

{"article": "Martin Shkreli's drug company Turing Pharmaceuticals bought the rights to 62-year old drug Daraprim and increased the price per pill from $13.50 to $750. Turing said it will cut the price by 50% for hospitals and offer financial assistance to individuals. However, the company will keep its list price at the new higher level. In September Turing promised to reduce the price. The pill costs around $1 for patients in Europe. In statement Turing's chief commercial officer Nancy Retzlaff defended the company's move. She said that reducing the listing price would not have translated into saving for patients. \"Drug pricing is one of the most complex parts of the healthcare industry. A drug's list price is not the primary factor in determining patient affordability and access,\" Ms Retzlaff said. Doctors though worry keeping the price so high will make it impossible for hospitals to stock the drug for the few patients who need it. \"The decision not to lower the price leaves patients in the same boat,\" said Dr Joel Gallant, medical director of special service at Southwest Care centre. Though Turing is offering payment assistance for some patients, Dr Gallant said this could still leave patients waiting for treatment. \"Patients start the drug in the hospital, but then they need to be discharged with the drug. While they wait for patient assistance to be approved they could be re-hospitalised,\" said Dr Gallant. The original increase sparked outrage on social media and among politicians. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called the increase \"price gouging\". Turing's chief executive Martin Shkreli- who had been labelled the most hated man in America-fought back saying politicians did not understand Pharmaceutical pricing. He later backed down and promised to lower the price of the drug, though never said by how much.

The report, by Cambridge Econometrics for RenewableUK, said wind power saved the UK \u00c2\u00a3579 million in fossil fuel costs in 2013. The UK is recognised for having the best wind resource in Europe. \"One of the main messages from this report is that in a scenario with a higher content of wind energy, you are less reliant on fossil fuels,\" explained co-author Sophie Billington, a researcher from Cambridge Econometrics. \"This is a key message, particularly when you consider that the UK - for the past five years or so - has imported more gas than it has produced domestically.\" She told BBC News that under a high gas scenario (gas power plants replacing end-of-life coal and nuclear plants) and a 40% increase in gas prices by 30%, electricity prices would increase by 8%. However, under a high wind scenario (wind farms replacing end-of-life coal and nuclear plants), electricity prices would still rise but by only 4%. \"For the wind scenario, you have higher upfront capital costs but fewer uncertain variable costs, leading to more price resilience,\" Ms Billington added. The report said that the UK electricity sector had undergone a substantial change in recent decades, shifting from a coal-based system to a more balanced mix \"encompassing nuclear and gas-fired power stations, as well as emerging renewable energy technologies\". It observed: \"Over the next 10 to 20 years, the energy sector will need to be re-shaped again if the UK's targets to reduce CO2 emissions are to be met.\" In 2008, the UK established the world's first legally binding climate change target, requiring governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% from 1990 levels by 2050. Rob Norris, RenewableUK's head of communications, said that currently there were \"not enough renewables in the system to meet those targets\". He told BBC News: \"The crucial thing is that energy policy is a long-term game and at the moment we only really know what the government support will be out to 2020. \"What you really need is a long-term vision out to 2030 so then you can plan, especially when it comes to things like large offshore developments.\" Mr Norris said he advocated a \"rich energy mix so then you do not put all your eggs in one basket\".

Mr Jones said Wales was ready to support the UK government in welcoming greater numbers of vulnerable children. The Home Office said its priority was to ensure the safety of children in the Calais camp. Mr Jones made the case in a joint statement with Kirsty Davies-Warner, head of Oxfam Cymru; Mary Powell-Chandler, head of Save the Children in Wales; Huw Thomas, head of Christian Aid Wales, and Jim Barnaville, co-chair of Citizens Cymru Wales. The statement said Mr Jones had written to the prime minister expressing \"our shared view that the UK government should take urgent action to resettle more unaccompanied refugee children in the UK and offering the support of Wales in welcoming them\". With the French government set to demolish the Calais \"Jungle\" camp, the statement asked Mrs May to \"allow all those refugee children with a legal right to be in the UK into the country with the utmost urgency\". \"The children in the camp, some of whom have been as young as eight years old, have fled conflict and persecution and are now stuck in northern France, deeply traumatised and at considerable risk,\" the statement read. \"Every extra day we take places these children at greater risk.\" The Immigration Act included an amendment, originally put forward by Lord Dubs, that places a legal requirement on government to arrange for the transfer to the UK of unaccompanied refugee children from Europe.

Jurors found the fans who died as a result of the 1989 crush were unlawfully killed. The families also complained about the conduct of South Yorkshire Police. They called on the home secretary to put the force into remedial measures. It is understood the proposed 'Hillsborough Law' would seek to place a further onus on those in public office to cooperate positively with investigations. The families were told about developments in two ongoing criminal investigations into the disaster at the meetings with the home secretary, which were held in Warrington. Theresa May has previously praised the dignity and determination of the victims' relatives. Chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Margaret Aspinall, whose son James died in the disaster, said: \"I myself for the very first time felt - I'm sure the families did as well - that at last there's a home secretary that's actually listening to them.\" The home secretary has met some Hillsborough families before, but this is the first time that she's spoken directly to them since the inquests ended. Theresa May spent several hours in Warrington, meeting separately with the two main groups of relatives. The atmosphere was said to be heated, with some of the families complaining directly to her about the conduct of South Yorkshire Police during the inquests. Some relatives asked for assurances that there will be criminal prosecutions, and I'm told that they wanted to make sure that the home secretary personally understood the emotional toll that the two-year inquests have taken. Although the Hillsborough families welcomed the jury's finding of unlawful killing, they know that many months of uncertainty lie ahead before they find out whether criminal trials will follow.

That's despite the Assembly not actually having sat for a full day of business since long before the March election. According to the paper, the rise will kick in on April Fool's Day and will see wages increase by \u00a3500 per year, bringing salaries to \u00a349,500. The paper reports a Stormont source confirmed the rise would go ahead because \"the consumer prices index for the September of the previous year was 1% or greater,\" and would happen automatically because of a measure put in place by the independent body that sets MLAs' wages. The Belfast Telegraph has also carried out its own poll on the issue and it says 93% of people surveyed would support stopping MLAs' wages altogether while the Assembly isn't functioning. In the Mirror we see the other side of the Stormont-deadlock coin, where it is claimed that 12,000 jobs could go as a result of the stalemate. The paper says a lack of progress by politicians means some 12-month contracts in the voluntary sector won't be renewed because no-one has been able to give the go-ahead for the funding. Staff at First Steps Women's Centre are among those who say they are facing unemployment. \"Our hundreds of clients are some of the most vulnerable in the country,\" said the organisation's chief executive, Michael McGoldrick. \"They deserve better, we all do. \"We are constantly on a funding rollercoaster, but this situation is particularly stomach churning. \"The prospect of us all losing our jobs is awful, but worse is the knock-on effect of us not being here and available to help the people who need us most. \"Those who are the most vulnerable are always first to be hit by this sort of problem and they are those who can least afford it.\" There's further criticism of the lack of leadership up at Stormont in the News Letter - it has chosen to go with the line: \"RHI official now controls all our public spending\". Northern Ireland's devolved finances have today been passed to David Sterling. The senior civil servant will use emergency powers to release cash and resources to departments until a new budget is in place. But the News Letter has pointed to Mr Sterling's links to the Renewable Heat Incentive. He was the most senior civil servant in the department that set up the \"financially disastrous\" initiative.

{"article": "Islamic tradition requires the dead to be buried as soon as possible, unless an autopsy is required. The US military took this requirement very seriously, burying the body within hours. \"Traditional procedures for Islamic burial were followed,\" an official said. Religious rites were carried out on the deck of a US aircraft carrier, the USS Carl Vinson. The body, shrouded in a white sheet and placed in a weighted bag, was then positioned on a flat board, tipped up, and eased into the Arabian Sea. This occurred at 0600GMT, approximately 12 hours after the firefight during which Osama Bin Laden was shot in the head. After this first shot, reports ABC News' The Blotter, he was shot again, to make sure that he was dead. \u00e2\u20ac\u00acThe body was then flown to Afghanistan and Bin Laden's identity was confirmed. Officials say a DNA sample was taken that matched that of several other family members. Some sources say facial recognition technology was also used. From Afghanistan, the body was, it appears, flown to the USS Carl Vinson. \"A military officer read prepared religious remarks, which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker,\" a US defence official said. According to UK-based Imam Dr Abduljalil Sajid, Chairman of the Muslim Council for Religious & Racial Harmony, four key steps need to be followed: . There is no necessity for an imam to be present, he says, but the procedures should be carried out by Muslims at least one of whom \"knows the minimum basic Muslim law of burial\". Whether any such person was present is impossible to know, he says, based on the limited information provided. But he also questions whether sea burial was appropriate in this case. It is correct to carry out a burial at sea when someone dies on a sea journey, he says, but in this case there was no sound reason for it. The US authorities could surely have found someone - a member of the extensive Bin Laden family, or even one of the many supporters of his \"evil\" ideology - who would have been prepared to give the body a proper burial, he argues. His words were echoed by Mohammed Qudah, a professor of Islamic law at the University of Jordan, who told the Associated Press news agency that burying Bin Laden at sea was not forbidden if there was nobody to receive the body and provide a Muslim burial. But he went on: \"It's neither true nor correct to claim that there was nobody in the Muslim world ready to receive Bin Laden's body.\" The agency also quoted Dubai's grand mufti Mohammed al-Qubaisi, saying that sea burials were permissible only in extraordinary circumstances, adding: \"This is not one of them.\" \"If the family does not want him, it's really simple in Islam: You dig up a grave anywhere, even on a remote island, you say the prayers and that's it,\" he said. US officials have given two reasons why a sea burial was chosen. First, that they did not want his grave to become a shrine. Second, that there was no time to negotiate with other countries to arrange a possible burial on land. According to CBS News, Saudi Arabia refused to take the body. If correct, this suggests that an offer was made - and that had Saudi Arabia accepted the body, there would have been a grave, which could in theory have become a shrine. However, ABC's Jonathan Karl, writing before the burial was confirmed, painted a different picture: . \"US officials tell me the last thing they want is for his burial place to become a terrorist shrine. \"To avoid that, an informed source tells me, the intention is to bury his body at sea - leaving no definitive location for the final resting place of his body.\"", "abstract": "US officials say Osama Bin Laden's body was treated with respect and buried at sea, but some Muslims argue there was no good reason for not burying it on land.", "candidate": "US officials have confirmed that Osama Bin Laden was buried at sea.", "doc_id": 1710, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "The body, shrouded in a white sheet and placed in a weighted bag, was then positioned on a flat board, tipped up, and eased into the Arabian Sea.", "explanation": "it correctly pulls the info (Osama, buried at sea, US officials) from the source text", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

He added Airbus had no plans to relocate its British factories. Airbus has said in the past that a \"Brexit\" might change its plans. Last month, Airbus UK's chief executive, Paul Kahn, said that if the UK voted to leave the EU in the planned in-out referendum, Airbus would reconsider future investment in the UK. On Tuesday, Mr Bregier admitted he would have to make a judgement about what the consequences would be for the competitiveness of his business following the referendum. His comments come as ministers tabled an amendment to the EU referendum bill on Monday evening, ruling out holding the plebiscite on 5 May 2016, the same day as Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish assembly elections and local elections. It means the referendum is unlikely to take place before the autumn of 2016, depending on the prime minister's ability to negotiate concessions from his European counterparts and despite calls for the UK to get the vote over with. Businesses have repeated raised concerns about the level of uncertainty caused by the timing of the referendum and the potential economic harm caused as investment decisions are delayed as a result. Last month, Mr Kahn said the UK must compete for international investment. \"The best way to guarantee this is by remaining part of the EU,\" he said. \"I believe that it is vital for a company such as Airbus to come out and make a stand in favour of Britain remaining in the European Union.\" Airbus, the world's second-largest aircraft manufacturer after Boeing, employs 6,000 people at its site at Broughton, north Wales, where it assembles the wings for all Airbus aircraft. Several thousand more people are employed at Filton, near Bristol, designing wings and testing landing gear.

Yes, absolutely.\" Airbus is one of Europe's biggest industrial enterprises spanning civil aviation, defence and space, with operations in Germany, France and Spain.

{"article": "Sri Lanka made 248-9 after half-centuries from Kusal Mendis (53), Dinesh Chandimal (62) and captain Angelo Mathews (56), as Liam Plunkett took 3-46. Rain delayed the start of the run chase and England were 16-1 as the weather forced the abandonment at 17:30 BST. England lead the five-match series 1-0. Alex Hales, who scored 133 not out in the second ODI, was out for a golden duck to the third ball of the run chase, leaving fellow opener Jason Roy and Joe Root at the crease when play ended. Plunkett took control at Bristol with the key wickets of Kusal Perera, Mendis and Seekkuge Prasanna after David Willey had removed Danushka Gunathilaka in the first over. Chandimal top scored for the visitors and held partnerships of 56 and 80 with Mendis and Mathews respectively. Chris Woakes (3-34) helped stifle Sri Lanka's innings towards the end, and finished with wickets in successive 49th-over deliveries. The next ODI takes place at The Oval on Wednesday. Plunkett appears to be getting into his groove against the Sri Lankans, having only returned to ODI cricket in June 2015 after more than four years out. The Yorkshire bowler has seven wickets so far in the series, although the highlight to date came with the bat when he smashed a six off the final ball of the opener at Trent Bridge to earn England a tie. At Bristol, Plunkett showed his ability across spells, dismissing Perera in his first over, before accounting for half-centurion Mendis just when Sri Lanka looked set for a productive recovery. He followed it up by removing the dangerous Prasanna for two in his third spell, leaving Woakes the task of helping to mop up the tail. Plunkett's wickets took his ODI tally to 52, and ensured Sri Lanka could not mount a serious challenge with the bat. The visitors, already reeling from Friday's 10-wicket defeat, were dealt an injury blow on Sunday when Lahiru Thirimanne was being flown back home with a lower back strain and replaced by Niroshan Dikwella. Captain Mathews and vice-captain Chandimal are also nursing hamstring niggles but played on. And Farveez Maharoof batted with a fractured finger on his left hand, becoming one of Woakes' victims late on. Overall, it paints a worrying picture for Sri Lanka, who are yet to win a game on their England tour, though Mathews and Chandimal making half-centuries would have been a positive. England captain Eoin Morgan on Sky Sports: \"We're building a lot of momentum towards where we want to be.

Neil Taylor will also be absent in Belgrade, the Aston Villa defender facing a potential three-match ban for the challenge which saw Republic captain Seamus Coleman require surgery on his shattered right leg. Reading defender Gunter, who became Wales' joint-third most capped player on Friday, says Wales have shown they can win without key players, even Bale, the world's second most expensive player. \"We've missed important players in the past and we've always said it's not a one-man team,\" Gunter said. \"For Gaz to play well, he needs the team. That won't change in the summer. \"You'd rather him in your team, but he's not there and we've got to get a result. \"We're more than capable with the squad we have to go and do that, with or without any of our players. \"We will deal with it and move on.\" Bale, who has scored four goals in this campaign, has not missed a competitive international since October 2013 - having featured in 21 successive competitive matches. His absence comes at a difficult time for third-placed Wales who are four points adrift of Serbia and the Republic of Ireland at the halfway stage, having drawn four of their five matches in Group D. But Gunter said: \"We've still got enough games to put a run of wins together and you can't predict how other results will go. \"We'd like to have picked up a couple more points, but it's never easy to qualify. \"We're still unbeaten and we're not far away from turning these draws into victories. \"Even though it could be better, we're not in the worst position we've ever been in. \"We've shown in the past that we can go anywhere and put wins together. We've got to remember that and stay positive.\" The Dublin draw was overshadowed by the horrendous injury to Everton defender Coleman. Media playback is not supported on this device . Coleman was treated at length on the pitch and given oxygen before being taken off the field on a stretcher. Asked if there was some incitement, with Republic midfielder Glenn Whelan having earlier struck his Stoke team-mate Joe Allen with a flailing forearm, Wales manager Chris Coleman said: \"Our boys will stand up for themselves because you have to. \"Take the Seamus Coleman incident out of it and there was a bit of needle, but you've got to expect that. \"What you don't expect is for anybody to come off with a serious injury - you don't want to see that. \"But there are no complaints for me, saying the Irish boys are this, that or the other.

The UN says 124,000 people reached Greece's shores by sea in the first seven months of 2015. Ms Olcay said the items would be bought elsewhere if she did not sell them. Admitting that she was taking part in the trade, she alleged that local Turkish authorities were also involved.

His inquiries brought him to a large store, with a French flag flying outside and a sign at the entrance saying \"French honorary consul\". Ms Olcay confirmed she was the consul, and that she sold boats to the migrants despite knowing it could lead to disaster. She told the reporter that it was wrong but everyone was doing it.

Details of the alleged plot are not known, but police say a hunting knife, an Islamic State (IS) flag and a video describing an attack were seized. Australia, which has joined the coalition fighting IS in Iraq, raised its domestic terror alert last year. The move was a response to growing concern over the impact of militant conflicts in Iraq and Syria. Sydney is also on alert after a siege at a cafe in the city in December which left two hostages and the gunman dead. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the latest arrests were a sign that the IS \"death cult\" was \"reaching out all around the world, including here in Australia, and regrettably there are people in this country who are susceptible to these incitements to extremism and even terrorism\". New South Wales Deputy Police Commissioner Catherine Burn said police believe the men arrested on Tuesday were preparing to carry out an attack that day. The video found in the raided home \"depicted a man talking about carrying out an attack\", said DC Burn, adding that the arrests were \"indicative of the threat\" the security agencies now have to deal with. No details have been given of the alleged plot, but she said the threat was \"consistent with the messaging coming out of IS\". The pair, named in court documents as Omar Al-Kutobi and Mohammad Kiad, were not previously known by police and counter-terrorism officers were only aware of them when they received information on Tuesday, forcing them to act immediately, she said. They have been charged with undertaking acts in preparation or planning for a terrorist act. They chose not to appear at an initial hearing on Wednesday, where bail was formally refused. New South Wales Premier Mike Baird urged vigilance and said the alleged plot was \"beyond disturbing\". \"Certainly something catastrophic was avoided yesterday and for that we should be very thankful,\" he said. Last September, Australia conducted its biggest counter-terrorism raid in Sydney, in response to intercepted intelligence about an alleged plots. About a dozen people have been arrested overall, including one man accused of plotting to behead members of the public in Sydney and Brisbane. Many of those targeted in the raids are alleged to be linked to or supportive of IS, or are accused of helping people travel overseas to fight with extremists. In October, Australia joined the US-led military action against IS in Iraq, with Mr Abbott saying IS was a \"death cult\" that must be stopped. But critics say this has increased the risk of attacks on Australian soil. The Australian government believes at least 60 Australians are fighting with terror groups in the Middle East and at least 100 are actively supporting them from home.

{"article": "SuperTed was born in south Wales as a book, before becoming a much-loved TV series on both sides of the Atlantic. It was shown as one of Welsh language broadcaster S4C's first programmes in November 1982, before being translated into English and shown on BBC One the following year. Barry-born Young, now 70, has spent most of his working life in animation in California, working as an independent in Hollywood dominated by the big studios. The former advertising copywriter has now produced a feature-length animation, Norm Of The North, and his next film project is close to his heart - about a former legend with his beloved Cardiff City football club. A BEAR BEGINNING . In 1978, Young created SuperTed as a story to read to his young stepson Richard, who was afraid of the dark, at bedtime. But the tales of the crime-solving superhero with special powers - and rivals like Texas Pete - soon got a wider audience. \"I went to the village hall one day to pick Richard up from play school and they said 'we love the SuperTed stories' and I said 'how do you know about those?' \"They said that 'he always tells us the story you told him last night'. \"We then got the books published, a couple of hundred were written, and then S4C came along and they wanted at least one thing which would travel all over the world - and it was successful. \"We became the first company to sell to Disney and we never looked back.\" Three TV series were made in the mid 1980s, with Derek Griffiths and Jon Pertwee providing the voices. Young also launched Welsh-language cartoon Wil Cwac Cwac and helped develop Fireman Sam. Now a new series of SuperTed is being planned, which Young again wants to make in Wales with some of the original team. HOLLYWOOD BECKONS . Young and his wife Liz created Mike Young Productions - which later become Splash Entertainment - and moved to Los Angeles in 1989. With much bigger rivals in Hollywood, he called it \"one of the most stupid, crazy decisions you could make\". But the company flourished. As well as collaborations, its animations have included Chloe's Closet, Dive Olly Dive!, Hero:108, Growing Up Creepie, Pet Alien and ToddWorld. NORM OF THE NORTH . Young's latest production is an animated feature film Norm Of the North about a polar bear. Norm, who can talk but cannot hunt, goes to New York with a gang of lemmings for adventure and to fight a tourism development in the Arctic. Although it does not have a big budget, the film uses the latest computer generated imagery (CGI) technology. \"We wanted to make something economic because I want the independents to have a chance and really get back into this business,\" said Young. \"It's all well and good having Disney, Pixar, Universal and DreamWorks but fundamentally they go a certain route but we can take more risks with what we do.\" The film, which includes voices from actors Rob Schneider and Bill Nighy, got its Welsh premiere at the Market Hall cinema in Brynmawr, Blaenau Gwent, earlier this week. CARDIFF CITY FAN IS THE RIGHT MATCH . He may live in California, but Cardiff City fan Young is now on the team making a film about one of the Bluebirds' most colourful characters. Friday (The Greatest Player You Never Saw) is about the late Robin Friday, who played for Cardiff and Reading in the 1980s before he died aged 38. \"He made George Best look like an angel,\" Young said. \"We've put together finance for it and got some big stars in it and it looks like we'll be shooting it in England or Ireland later this summer.\"", "abstract": "Once upon a time, there was a bedtime story - and it was the start of a long career for TV and film producer Mike Young.", "candidate": "SuperTed creator Mike Young is planning a new series of the Welsh-language superhero, 30 years after he first introduced the character to the world.", "doc_id": 1737, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "SuperTed creator Mike Young is planning a new series of the Welsh-language superhero, years after he first introduced the character to the world.", "evidence": "Now a new series of SuperTed is being planned, which Young again wants to make in Wales with some of the original team.", "explanation": "The summary has stated 30 years since the chararcter was first introduced, however there is nothing in the source text to support the number of years it has been.", "instruction": "Remove the information about 30 from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about 30 from the summary."]}}

The Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) says teachers need more training to help them identity and protect girls at risk. At least 66,000 girls and women in the UK are believed to be victims of FGM. Campaigners say girls are most at risk of undergoing the procedure during the long summer holidays. The ATL, at its annual conference in Manchester, passed a resolution to lobby politicians to eliminate the practice and to develop resources to advise teachers and support staff on how to tackle the problem. Proposing the motion, Helen Porter, from Berkshire, said school staff should openly discuss the issue with parents. \"Schools and education staff can help by opening discussion with parents, and scrutinising holiday requests and summer holiday plans from members of communities that practise FGM. \"They should be vigilant for the signs of FGM such as frequent toilet visits and pain whilst sitting down. Schools should publicise the NSPCC's FGM helpline to pupils, parents and staff. \"We must aim to empower girls by discussion in age-appropriate PSHE [personal, social and health education] lessons delivered by trained teachers. \"We must equally empower boys to challenge this practice. Do they want this for their sisters, daughters, girlfriends or wives?\" Ms Porter said the practice of FGM should never be described as female circumcision, as there was no medical benefit and rarely any anaesthetic used. She said the term female circumcision was \"equivalent to describing deforestation as rainforest topiary\". Ms Porter said: \"FGM is child abuse. It is a violation of a child's human rights, and according to the United Nations is a cruel, inhumane and degrading torture that should be eliminated.\" Tendai Mashapure, from Cambridgeshire, said: \"We need to commit ourselves to the creation of an enabling environment where individuals are empowered to make decisions based on the best interest of their children. \"FGM will not end only by targeting those who practise FGM, but rather by engaging with all families, focusing on youth who will be future parents and targeting the leaders who have influence over community members. \"In other words, by reducing the demand for the practice, it will eventually become obsolete.\" ATL general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said: \"Teachers have been put in a position of great responsibility. What they need now is clear guidance on how to fulfil those responsibilities. \"They need a clear system for reporting their concerns.\" Dr Bousted welcomed the letter that Education Secretary Michael Gove sent to schools last term, urging them to protect girls at risk from what he described as \"this very serious form of child abuse\". FGM includes procedures that remove or injure female genital organs for non-medical reasons. Dangers include severe bleeding, problems urinating, infections, infertility, mental health problems, complications in childbirth and increased risk of death for newborns.

{"article": "Ofsted says it has found evidence of children being taught in squalid conditions in three places in Birmingham which have now closed. Anyone running illegal schools could face a jail term of up to 51 weeks. Ministers are also consulting on plans for more regulation of places teaching for more than 6 to 8 hours a week. Sir Michael Wilshaw, Chief Inspector of Schools in England, told the BBC this week that his inspectors were visibly shocked by the conditions they found. It is understood that a total of 18 unregulated schools, mainly in Muslim communities in the Midlands, have been visited as part of an investigation in recent months. Three places in Birmingham have been closed and the owners are being investigated under suspicion of running an illegal school. Sir Michael said the cases uncovered were likely to be the \"tip of the iceberg\" and he was seriously concerned that children were at risk of being abused or radicalised. Any place where children are taught for more than 20 hours a week has to register as a school. Some places describing themselves as part-time education centres or \"flexi schools\" are operating within the law providing support for home-educated children. But Ofsted and ministers are concerned that some are taking advantage of the legal right to home educate to operate what are in fact illegal schools. In a letter to the education secretary on Friday, Sir Michael suggested officials had been slow to take decisive action in the three places which Ofsted had closed with the help of the local council. \"This was achieved in spite of your officials providing, what I believe to be, confusing and unhelpful advice to the proprietors that they could now apply to register their provision.\" The government has provided funding for a team of six inspectors whose job will be to investigate illegal schools. While most of the places visited by Ofsted so far have been in Muslim communities, inspectors may also turn their attention to similar unregistered tuition centres operated by other groups. \"It will apply across the board, to any religious group whether Muslim group, Jewish group, or Christian group who wants to operate this sort of provision in unsafe accommodation, in unhygienic and filthy accommodation. \"It will apply to all religious groups, I want to make that absolutely clear,\" Sir Michael told the BBC. The education secretary has now said she intends to go further. \"I have now asked Ofsted to prepare cases for prosecution against unregistered schools it has identified. For a child to spend a single day in one of these schools is unacceptable.\" In order for a prosecution to be brought against an unregistered school the Education Secretary has to give consent.

{"article": "The animal charity said there were 297 convictions last year in Wales, a rise of 20%, following an increase in the number of animal welfare cases reported. RSPCA Cymru's Steve Carter said workers faced \"immense demands\". The charity said the economic downturn was probably still partly to blame with some people unable to look after pets. The 100% conviction rate was up from 97.8%. Mr Carter said it demonstrated \"how robust our investigative process is\". The number of animals rescued or collected also more than doubled, which the charity says is more positive. Other figures reported for 2013: . HORSE SUFFERING: A Gwynedd horse breeder allowed his ponies to suffer so much that nine had to be put down. Evan Lloyd Evans, 69, was jailed for 10 weeks after being found guilty of multiple animal welfare offences in October 2013. The conditions the horses were kept in were described as \"appalling and completely inappropriate\". EMACIATED DOGS: In another case, a married couple from Pembrokeshire were banned from keeping dogs for five years after their dogs were found to be so emaciated that one of them - a lurcher - weighed less than a cat. CATS LEFT TO BREED: A mother and daughter from Wrexham who neglected 17 cats in their care were disqualified from keeping all animals indefinitely. The family had left the cats to breed uncontrollably with only one of their cats being neutered. Several, including the two kittens, had to be put to sleep because of their serious health issues. Both women were given community orders. 'WORST' FLEA INFESTATION: A suspended sentence and life ban were given to a Pontypridd man, 55, who had a cat with the worst flea infestation the vet had ever seen. The cat, which was found living in squalid conditions in an upstairs bedroom, recovered. The man had previously been prosecuted by the RSPCA regarding two of his dogs. Source: RSPCA . The RSPCA believes the economic downturn could still be playing in part in the increase in cases reported to it, where people are unable to look after pets which in some cases leads to neglect.

{"article": "The actress revealed in May last year she had had the surgery, after being told she had an 87% chance of the disease because of a high-risk gene. The news encouraged women with genuine concerns about their family history to get advice, a study found. About 5% of breast cancers are thought to be hereditary. \"The Angelina Jolie effect has been long-lasting and global, and appears to have increased referrals to centres appropriately,\" said a team led by Prof\u00c2\u00a0Gareth Evans of the University of Manchester. The researchers looked at referrals to more than 20 genetic centres and clinics in the UK after the story hit the press in May 2013. In June and July the number of GP referrals for genetic counselling and DNA tests for breast cancer mutations increased two and a half times compared with the same period in 2012. The study, published in the journal, Breast Cancer Research, found referrals remained at twice the previous year's figure from August to October. \"Angelina Jolie stating she has a BRCA1 mutation and going on to have a risk-reducing mastectomy is likely to have had a bigger impact than other celebrity announcements, possibly due to her image as a glamorous and strong woman,\" said Prof Evans. \"This may have lessened patients' fears about a loss of sexual identity post-preventative surgery and encouraged those who had not previously engaged with health services to consider genetic testing.\" Most breast cancers happen by chance but a small number of people diagnosed with breast cancer (5%) have inherited a fault in one of the known breast cancer genes; BRCA1, BRCA2 or TP53 which puts them at higher risk. Angelina Jolie is not alone in influencing health behaviour. Attendance for cervical cancer screening rose in 2008 and 2009, when the celebrity Jade Goody was diagnosed with cervical cancer and died. Baroness Delyth Morgan is chief executive at Breast Cancer Campaign, which part-funded the research. \"Without Angelina Jolie's openness in talking about her BRCA1 mutation and decision to have a risk-reducing mastectomy, followed by the publication and publicity around the updated NICE guidelines soon after, many women may not have approached health services and so would never have had their risk and risk-reducing options explained,\" she said. Funding for genetic services must be able to respond quickly to demand, to ensure risk counselling and genetic testing is available for everyone in need, she added. \"The current level of funding available for this service should be reviewed, to avoid unnecessary delays, which can be very stressful for patients.\" Women in general have a one in eight chance of developing breast cancer during their lifetime, but genes can put some at higher risk. In the UK, about one in 1,000 people will have inherited a BRCA1 mutation and a similar proportion will have inherited a BRCA2 mutation. Women who are tested early can take steps to prevent themselves from developing the disease. This may mean a risk-reducing mastectomy, cancer preventing drugs, such as tamoxifen, and certain lifestyle changes like a healthy diet and more exercise. Lester Barr, chairman of Genesis Breast Cancer Prevention, said: \"While a woman's risk of developing breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer is greatly increased if she carries the harmful mutation of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, preventative surgery is by no means the answer for everyone. \"Of course, a preventative mastectomy is the most effective way to cut a woman's risk of breast cancer, however other options should also be considered. These include prevention drugs, such as tamoxifen, which has been approved by NICE. \"Alternatively, many women with a mutated BRCA gene opt for annual check-ups which can be arranged through the NHS.\"", "abstract": "Referrals to breast cancer clinics more than doubled in the UK after Angelina Jolie announced she had had a double mastectomy to prevent breast cancer.", "candidate": "Angelina Jolie's decision to have a double mastectomy has led to a surge in referrals for genetic testing, say researchers.", "doc_id": 1750, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Angelina Jolie's decision to have a mastectomy has led to a surge in referrals for genetic testing, say researchers.", "evidence": "Angelina Jolie stating she has a BRCA1 mutation and going on to have a risk-reducing mastectomy is likely to have had a bigger impact than other celebrity announcements, possibly due to her image as a glamorous and strong woman,\" said Prof Evans.", "explanation": "it makes up that she had a double masectomy", "instruction": "Remove the information about Jolie having a double masectomy from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about Jolie having a double masectomy from the summary."]}}
{"article": "The group carried out a nine-month investigation into the 53,000 images handed to the opposition by a military police photographer, codenamed Caesar. Researchers interviewed former prisoners, defectors, forensic experts and families of the disappeared. Syria's government and its allies had questioned the images' authenticity. They were first published in January 2014 in a report by three former war crimes prosecutors that was commissioned by Qatar, which supports the political and armed opposition in Syria. In an interview earlier this year, President Bashar al-Assad said: \"You can bring photographs from anyone and say this is torture. There is no verification of any of this evidence, so it's all allegations without evidence.\" But on Wednesday, Human Rights Watch laid out in a new report what it said was new evidence regarding the authenticity of the Caesar photographs, identifying a number of the victims and highlighting some of the key causes of death. The US-based group said it had located and interviewed 33 relatives and friends of 27 victims whose cases researchers verified; 37 former detainees who saw people die in detention; and four defectors who worked in Syrian government detention centres or the military hospitals where most of the photographs were taken. Syria torture report . In pictures: Syria accused of torture . Using satellite imagery and geolocation techniques, HRW confirmed that some of the photographs of the dead were taken in the courtyard of the 601 Military Hospital in Mezzeh, a western suburb of the capital Damascus. The group also identified a coding system for the cards placed on the bodies. \"We have meticulously verified dozens of stories, and we are confident the Caesar photographs present authentic - and damning - evidence of crimes against humanity in Syria,\" said Nadim Houry, HRW's deputy Middle East director. HRW said its report focused on 28,707 of the 53,275 photos smuggled out of Syria by Caesar that, based on all available information, showed the bodies of at least 6,786 people who died in detention or after being transferred from detention to a military hospital. The remaining photographs are of attack sites or of bodies identified by name as of government soldiers, other combatants, or civilians killed in attacks, explosions or assassination attempts. Most of the victims were detained by just five intelligence agency branches in Damascus, and their bodies were sent to at least two military hospitals in Damascus between May 2011, when Caesar began copying files and smuggling them out of his workplace, and August 2013, when he fled Syria, HRW said. Forensic pathologists from Physicians for Human Rights analysed a subset of the photos, and found evidence of several types of torture, starvation, suffocation, violent blunt force trauma, and in one case, a gunshot wound to the head. Among the 27 victims identified by HRW - all of whose families spent months or years searching for news of their whereabouts, in many cases paying huge sums to contacts and middlemen - were Rehab al-Allawi, a boy who was 14 at the time of his arrest for having an anti-Assad song on his phone, and student Rehab al-Allawi, who was 25 when she was detained while working with an activist group. The former detainees, held in the same places as most of the victims, told HRW that guards kept them in severely overcrowded cells with very little air circulation, gave them so little food that they grew weak, and often denied them the opportunity to wash. Skin diseases and other infectious diseases proliferated, and the detainees said guards denied them adequate medical care. \"Many of the former detainees who were held in these nightmarish conditions told us they often wished they would die, rather than continue suffering,\" Mr Houry said.

Matthew Davies, 33, of Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taff, said he suffered injuries in a \"genuine\" crash. A guitar worth \u00a31,850 was also damaged, he said. On Monday, the court heard Mr Davies, who runs a valeting business, expressed his disapproval of personal injury claims during an interview about his own. \"It's not something I agree with,\" he said at the time. \"I understand the reflection that personal injuries and claims have on the price of people's insurance policies.\" The prosecution said he was also recorded as having stated everyone else \"is doing it, so I'm going to put one (a claim) in\".

Grant Langston, chief executive of eHarmony, told BBC Radio 5 live's Wake Up To Money that the increase in activity on his site was reminiscent of those seen after the 9/11 attacks. \"You see a spike in usage after Donald Trump and people's desires to be in a relationship, so if they're in a bad relationship they don't want to leave, and if they're not in one, they want to get into one. \"November is usually a pretty low season, and we saw a tremendous spike in usage after the November 8 election. When 9/11 happened we saw a similar change in people. When times get unpredictable, they just want to be with someone.\" It's not only a changing political climate that is keeping eHarmony and its customers on their toes. Since the company was founded 17 years ago in California, the dating site now has many more competitors, with one in particular changing the landscape. \"Tinder has made 20-somethings want to participate in online dating. Prior to that, it wasn't something that interested people in their 20s, they thought online dating was sad,\" says Mr Langston. But he also sees Tinder's emergence as an opportunity for his business, which asks people to fill in long questionnaires in the hope of finding a long-term match. \"People in that age group come into the market, then we catch people who aren't satisfied with the Tinder experience or are more interested in a more meaningful relationship.\" Although he hasn't followed the \"swipe left\" style of Tinder, eHarmony has had to adapt as a result. \"The mechanism of delivering that service has got to change, and we've changed it a lot. The communication process, where you swap messages, was quite antiquated, and we've made it much more like text, immediate and very easy.\" While Donald Trump may have got those looking for love logging in, has that other first-date conversational taboo - Brexit - had much of an impact on eHarmony and its choice of European headquarters? \"For now we're ok with [our London office],\" Mr Lagston says, though he adds, \"there is always a chance we could move it to Frankfurt or some such place.\"", "abstract": "From the moment Donald Trump's election victory was confirmed on 9 November, all sorts of businesses have had to keep alert to the fallout of a result they didn't expect.", "candidate": "Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election has thrown the world of business into turmoil.", "doc_id": 1774, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election has thrown the world of online dating into a frenzy.", "evidence": "While Donald Trump may have got those looking for love logging in, has that other first-date conversational taboo - Brexit - had much of an impact on eHarmony and its choice of European headquarters?", "explanation": "The summary has incorrectly interpreted that the business world is in turmoil, while the context of the source is that there has been a spike in dating site activity.", "instruction": "Replace the information about the world of business into turmoil. with the information about the world of online dating into a frenzy.", "instruction_list": ["Replace the information about the world of business into turmoil. with the information about the world of online dating into a frenzy."]}}
{"article": "Appearing on BBC Scotland's Ask the Leader, she defended her mandate for a second independence referendum. But the first minister said it would happen only after the outcome of the Brexit negotiations became clear. She also confirmed controversial plans to fast track new teachers into classrooms were to go ahead. She was the last of the four main party leaders in Scotland to appear on the programme, before a live studio audience, in the week before the general election on 8 June. She faced questions on the SNP government's ten year record on education and health. Ms Sturgeon also said it was important to have organisations like the EU to help deal with global problems such as climate change and said no single country could tackle such issues \"despite what President Trump seems to think\". The first minister insisted her government had a mandate to hold a second independence referendum following last year's Scottish Parliament elections which left the SNP the biggest single party, but no longer with an overall majority. She said: \"We fought an election to the Scottish Parliament last year. The manifesto which I fought that election on said that if a scenario - which I hoped didn't arise - where Scotland voted to stay in the EU and the rest of the UK voted to leave - I thought in those circumstances Scotland should have the choice about its future. \"I don't think we should face that choice now, but at the end of the Brexit deal, when we know what the deal looks like.\" The SNP leader said there were many challenges facing the country and she was said independence in itself was not the answer to all of them. \"I don't say that independence is a magic solution to everything,\" she said. \"Nor do I say supporting independence lets me and my government off the hook. We've got challenges in Scotland - like every other country.\" Asked about her offer of a \"compromise deal\" to take another independence referendum off the table if Scotland were able to remain part of the EU single market after a Brexit deal, Ms Sturgeon said: \"I'm very aware there are many people in Scotland who don't want independence, but don't want to leave the EU either. \"I'm trying to find a compromise.\" On education, the first minister was quizzed over standards in literacy and numeracy, with two recent reports indicating that standards in schools have been falling while her party has been in office. The issue of class sizes and teacher numbers were also raised by teachers in the audience. Ms Sturgeon defended her government's record, cited areas of additional spending and said parts of the Curriculum for Excellence needed greater focus. She also confirmed that plans to fast-track graduates into teaching roles could soon be put into place to help ease teacher shortages. The move, which could see graduates placed into teaching roles with just five weeks postgraduate training as opposed to a year-long teaching qualification, are vigorously opposed by teaching unions, including Scotland's biggest, the EIS, which has already warned it would oppose any move to \"dilute\" teachers' status. She said teacher recruitment challenges were \"not unique to Scotland\". She added: \"We are about to go out to tender for an additional different route into teaching.\" Earlier on Friday, speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the first minister said the SNP could support a Labour government \"on an issue-by-issue basis\" in the event of a hung parliament. Both parties have ruled out a formal coalition deal should the election on 8 June not produce a clear winner. But Ms Sturgeon said she would be open to forming a \"progressive alternative to a Conservative government\".

{"article": "Relieved that the giant telecoms company would not be broken up, they piled into the shares, sending them up 3% in early trading. BT dodged a bullet - and, as the chief executive of Ofcom, Sharon White, admitted, it was for prosaic reasons. She said complications with land deals and BT's giant pension scheme meant there were \"practical obstacles\" to a break-up that would delay the process several years. It's the pension scheme that probably most influenced Ofcom's thinking. BT's retirement scheme, inherited from its time as a state-owned utility, has assets of about \u00c2\u00a340bn and a deficit, on some measures, of about \u00c2\u00a310bn, even though BT has poured in billions of pounds in recent years to redress the gap. Senior sources at the company say that about 80% of the scheme relates to Openreach, the internet infrastructure provider that BT's rivals would like to see spun off. Separating the pension as part of a break-up would be a costly headache - and there is the small matter of a government guarantee on part of the scheme, something that BT fought in the courts to preserve and won. Creating two new pension schemes, with the risk of weakening the financial resources of one or the other, might be too hot a political potato, even in the pursuit of faster broadband. BT's share price reaction might turn out to be overdone. Ms White plans to enforce the separation by introducing not only a new board to run Openreach, but also new articles of association that will give directors a duty to serve customers of the network as much as the company's owners. This holds out an obvious prospect of conflicts to come, and runs counter to the normal assumption that in private companies, the shareholder is king. It also carries an echo of the \"golden shares\" held by the government in Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems, two companies judged important for the defence of the realm. In each case, the golden share is actually enshrined by specific articles of association that give directors and the government powers beyond those normally enjoyed by company boards. BT's chief executive, Gavin Patterson, said he thought he could reach a compromise with Ofcom, but admitted they would need to see the detail of the new articles.

The algorithm could be adapted for use in medicine, cybersecurity, business and the military, its creators said. The matches - dubbed Brains v Artificial Intelligence - are being held over 20 days at Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh. The four human players are matched against Libratus, an artificial intelligence program developed at Carnegie Mellon University's (CMU) school of computer science. It uses algorithms built over 15 million core hours of computation at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Centre to analyse the rules of poker. Viewers can watch the entire event live on video-streaming games site Twitch, where there will be a stream for each of the human players: . The players are vying for shares of a $200,000 (\u00c2\u00a3162,000) prize, while the CMU scientists are hoping to set a new benchmark for artificial intelligence. \"Since the earliest days of AI research, beating top human players has been a powerful measure of progress in the field,\" said Tuomas Sandholm, professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon. \"That was achieved with chess in 1997, with Jeopardy in 2009 and with the board game Go just last year. \"Poker poses a far more difficult challenge than these games, as it requires a machine to make extremely complicated decisions based on incomplete information while contending with bluffs, slow play and other ploys.\" A similar contest in 2015, with a computer program dubbed Claudico, failed to beat the humans, with scientists concluding that the 80,000 hands it had played had proved too few to establish its superiority. This time around, there will be 120,000 hands. Claudico also made some obvious bluffs that they had been able to exploit, the players said. This time around, the AI will be able to bluff with precisely calculated values to balance risk and reward. It will also be able to deploy random moves in a way that human players would have great difficulty doing. The scientists hope that it could baffle human opponents, with unusual strategies such as making tiny bets or massive over-bets. Player Jason Les said of the new contest: \"I'm very excited to see what this latest AI is like.\" \"I thought Claudico was tough to play; knowing the resources and the ideas that Dr Sandholm and his team have had available in the 20 months since the first contest, I assume this AI will be even more challenging.\" Solving the complex game of poker had many real-world applications, Dr Sandholm said. \"Extending AI to real-world decision-making, where details are unknown and adversaries are actively revising their strategies, is fundamentally harder than games with perfect information or question-answering systems,\" said Nick Nystrom, senior director of research at Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center . \"This is where it really gets interesting.\"", "abstract": "An unusual poker game is taking place in Pittsburgh, pitting human players against  an artificial intelligence program.", "candidate": "The world's best poker players are facing off against an artificial intelligence program in a tournament in the US.", "doc_id": 1781, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "The goal is to see if a computer can beat four of the best players in the variant of poker known as no-limit heads-up Texas hold 'em.", "explanation": "The players are facing the AI to see who will win so according to the source and summary, it's a game of humans vs AI which is accurate.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

For the group as a whole, including its businesses in Ireland, the European mainland and Asia, the rise was 0.9%. Tesco also said it had agreed to sell its Harris & Hoole coffee shop chain to Caffe Nero. In recent weeks the retailer has announced the sale of its Dobbies Garden Centres chain and restaurant chain Giraffe, so that it can focus on the main supermarket business. Dobbies was sold to a group of investors led by Midlothian Capital Partners and Hattington Capital, while the owner of Harry Ramsden's restaurants, Boparan, snapped up Giraffe. In April, Tesco announced its first growth in quarterly sales for three years, with UK like-for-like sales up 0.9%. Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis said: \"We have delivered a second quarter of positive like-for-like sales growth across all parts of the group in what remains a challenging market with sustained deflation. We are encouraged by the progress we are making.\" Shares closed up 1.8% at 169.49p, bringing the rise this year to just over 12%. Tesco also hailed the success of its new fresh food brands, with two-thirds of its customers having already tried the ranges. \"Customer ratings for the quality of our fresh food offer as a whole have improved to their highest level in more than two years,\" the supermarket said. The fresh food ranges, launched in March, courted controversy because they were named after fictional farms with British-sounding names. However, the produce is often sourced from abroad. \"While the naming controversy provoked something of a media storm, this may have been lost on customers,\" said David Alexander, senior analyst at Verdict Retail. \"After all, the strategy is similar to that employed by Aldi and suggests that for most shoppers, the perception of provenance is sufficient, provided the products are perceived to be good value.\" Tesco and its \"big four\" peers - Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - are under continuing pressure as they face competition from discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl. And earlier this month, online retailer Amazon launched its Amazon Fresh grocery delivery service in central and east London, with plans to roll the deliveries out further across the UK. Since taking over as Tesco chief in September 2014, Mr Lewis has put Tesco's focus on price cuts and putting more staff in stores in an attempt to revive the company's fortunes. As a result of its price-cutting efforts, Tesco said, the cost of a weekly shop in its supermarkets was now 6% lower than when Mr Lewis took over. Richard Hunter, head of research at Wilson King Investment Management, said Mr Lewis was \"clearly aiming to return the stock to its former status as a market darling, an accolade which has long since disappeared\". \"Nonetheless, a number of red flags remain,\" he added. \"Ongoing investment in the business as announced at the full-year results will drag on profits, competition in the sector remains fierce and the shares are on an expensive multiple compared to its peers. \"Even so, the previously highlighted reductions in net debt and costs are complemented by strong revenue streams and there appears to be a clear line of progress emerging. \"It remains to be seen whether this new-found optimism will percolate to a share price which has dropped 22% over the last year, as compared to an 8% dip for the wider FTSE 100.\"", "abstract": "Tesco has said it is \"encouraged\" by its progress in a challenging market as it reported a second consecutive quarter of higher sales.", "candidate": "Tesco has reported its first rise in UK sales for more than two years.", "doc_id": 1783, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "Tesco has reported its first rise in quarterly UK sales for more than two years", "evidence": "In April, Tesco announced its first growth in quarterly sales for three years, with UK like-for-like sales up 0.9%.", "explanation": "it leaves out that the growth in sales was quarterly", "instruction": "Add the information about the growth in sales being for the quarter to the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Add the information about the growth in sales being for the quarter to the summary."]}}

They will serve half their terms in prison and half on licence. A third man on charges died on Tuesday. Connor Devenney, 36, from Dunwellan Park in Newcastle, County Down, appeared in court last week, when the Crown set out its case against the three men. However, a judge was told that Devenney, who faced two charges linked to the operation, died on Tuesday night.

{"article": "South Yorkshire Police's public protection unit spent a \"great deal of time\" trying to \"disprove\" allegations, said HM Inspectorate of Constabulary. It said the force's public protection unit showed \"a disregard for victims\". A separate report on Tuesday found a \"collective failure\" by the authorities to stop child abuse in Rotherham. That inquiry, by Professor Alexis Jay, said at least 1,400 children were sexually exploited from 1997-2013, mainly by gangs of men of Pakistani heritage. The new investigation, which saw HMIC inspectors visit South Yorkshire Police in February, threatened to put more pressure on police and crime commissioner Shaun Wright. He has so far resisted calls to resign as commissioner, with David Cameron and Nick Clegg the latest politicians to call for him to go. He has quit the Labour Party. Mr Wright was the councillor responsible children's services at Rotherham Borough Council between 2005 and 2010 . In a statement, Mr Wright said he had \"formally\" tendered his resignation from the Labour Party. But he insisted he was the most appropriate person to hold the office of police and crime commissioner (PCC). The HMIC report said South Yorkshire Police's public protection unit (PPU) had a cultural \"disregard for victims\". It criticised the unit for under-recording crime, highlighting the impact this had on vulnerable children who had been victims of sexual assault. The HMIC looked at 117 crimes that should have been recorded, but found that only 89 had been. Of those, three were wrongly classified. The report highlighted \"a serious need for improvement in the accuracy and timeliness of crime recording decisions\". It said: \"There is an inherent risk that a significant number of reported offences of a serious nature have not been recorded and that vulnerable victims have, as a consequence, been left unprotected or at risk of further offending.\" The force welcomed the HMIC report, but it said it was important to note it was about the recording of crime and not the way it was investigated. \"We recognise that systems need improving and there is a programme in place to do so, including IT and the force's public protection unit stand-alone system,\" the statement said. Rotherham isn't alone in facing the distressing problem of child sexual abuse. But the report exposed a deeply dysfunctional system here. The council insists things have improved significantly in recent years. Many, though, are still shocked that efforts to confront exploitation fell woefully short. Was there a particular problem specific to Rotherham? Did Labour's total dominance of this authority allow a complacent, rotten culture to develop? Was the political opposition so enfeebled that effective challenge to the leadership was striking by its absence? As people here reflect on these political questions, it's worth thinking for a moment about the complex, corporate identity of modern councils. Social workers report to safeguarding managers, child protection co-ordinators, directors of services, and chief executives. All overseen by 63 elected councillors. Such a complex web of relationships. So many different chains of command - making true accountability very hard to establish. South Yorkshire Police is already under scrutiny after Professor Jay's report criticised police for not making child sexual exploitation (CSE) a priority and \"regarding many child victims with contempt\". The force currently has 173 \"live\" investigations into suspected CSE. The number includes 32 probes in Rotherham, a spokeswoman for the force said. Supt Jason Harwin said that in the last 12 months in Rotherham 15 people had been prosecuted or charged with CSE-related offences.

{"article": "Ceding control of ARM is an example of the City mindset of \"don't back [the] British economy\", he told the BBC. But Treasury advisor Eileen Burbidge said the sale was a \"great deal\". On Tuesday, 95% of ARM shareholders voted to back the acquisition by Softbank. Lord Myners said ARM, which provides chip designs used by firms including Apple, was a company \"at the heart of the ecosystem of modern technologies\". He said control of ARM was now passing to a \"very heavily-indebted, very unfocused business in Japan which does not have a good record of buying foreign companies and continuing to invest in them\". Decisions on the company's future would be made in Tokyo rather than Cambridge, he said. Lord Myners added that commitments made by Softbank to the UK government to double the number of UK employees over the next five years and to keep the headquarters of the firm in Cambridge were \"probably not legally enforceable\". \"If ARM was an American company, a German, a French company or a Japanese company, it would not be able to be sold in 60 days - there would be a question of national significance and public policy to determine whether we should sell,\" he said. However, Ms Burbidge said the \u00a324.3bn deal was at a 43% premium above the closing share price the day before the deal was announced. \"It's obviously a very good deal for shareholders, [and] for a company that generated just shy of \u00a31bn in turnover last year, it represents... a really great multiple and demonstrates that Softbank saw a lot of growth potential and opportunity in the company,\" she said.

{"article": "They say that the new material is more robust and hardwearing than previous efforts to create artificial cartilage. A traditional ink-jet printer combined with a specialised spinning-machine is used to make it. It could lead to bespoke cartilage created for individual patients. But one expert warned it was too early to be confident it would ever be used. The study was published in the Institute of Physics' journal Biofabrication. It marks the latest effort to use 3D printers in medicine following the use of a machine to make a replacement lower jaw and efforts to create 3D-printed scaffolds to support the growth of bone cells. Scientists said they were able to build cartilage made from a chemical compound known as a polymer coated with cartilage cells from a rabbit's ear. They combined the ink-jet printer with a machine that uses an electric current to spin very fine fibres from the polymer solution. It allowed the construction to be easily controlled, meaning scientists could make the artificial cartilage porous. This is key to encouraging real cartilage cells to integrate into the surrounding tissue. So far the printed cartilage has been tested on mice and, after eight weeks, appeared to have developed the properties of real cartilage, suggesting it has potential for insertion into human patients. The scientists said that in the future it could allow medics to create cartilage specific to each patient's needs. They suggest an MRI scan could create a blueprint of a body part, such as a knee, and matching cartilage could be made using the 3D printer. \"This is a proof-of-concept study and illustrates that a combinations of materials and fabrication methods generates durable implantable constructs,\" said James Yoo, a professor at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, and one of the paper's authors. At present one of the best options available to doctors treating cartilage damage is a technique called microfracture surgery. It involves drilling small holes into the bone in the cartilage's gap to encourage bleeding. Scar tissue then forms over the gap, acting as a replacement for the missing cartilage. But it is not generally suitable for older or more obese patients, and it does not work if the lesion is too large. Dr Richard Weiler - a consultant in sport and exercise medicine at University College London Hospitals - told the BBC the new innovation could potentially offer respite to a wider range of the patients he treated. But he had doubts about whether it would ever be used. \"Certainly with sport there are injuries that cause damage to cartilage - we have seen this with some famous footballers, cyclists and other athletes who have had traumatic injuries where the cartilage has been damaged and then drops off and doesn't grow back very well in the affected area,\" he said. \"However, there have been lots of previous cartilage replacement technologies that were shown to have had an effect in animals but have proved not to be as good as hoped when used long-term by humans. \"This technology sounds an interesting development, we would just want to make sure it's safe.\"", "abstract": "Researchers have developed a way to \"print\" cartilage that could help treat joint diseases and sporting injuries.", "candidate": "US scientists say they have developed a 3D-printed cartilage that could be used to repair damaged body parts.", "doc_id": 1796, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Scientists say they have developed an artificial cartilage that could be used to repair damaged body parts", "evidence": "They say that the new material is more robust and hardwearing than previous efforts to create artificial cartilage.", "explanation": "it makes up that they're US scientists and the cartilage is 3-d printed", "instruction": "Remove the information about the scientists being from the US and the cartilage being 3-d printed from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about the scientists being from the US and the cartilage being 3-d printed from the summary."]}}

It highlighted one case in which a customer would pay \u00c2\u00a3465 more than the amount advertised during a contract. The trade body for internet service providers, ISPA, said broadband prices were \"clearly presented\". Nicholas Lansman, ISPA secretary-general, said: \"It is important that customers look at the full terms of an offer when choosing a provider. \"Ofcom recently concluded that the UK has one of the most competitive broadband markets among major European economies, as the average price of a fixed broadband package has fallen by 40% and speeds have greatly increased.\" Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said confusing teaser rates and hidden costs made it difficult for consumers to work out whether they were getting a good deal. \"Internet providers need to be upfront about broadband costs, ensuring adverts are transparent and people know what they are signing up to,\" she said. \"Some broadband firms are starting to accept that prices need to be clearer. Now the whole industry needs to up its game.\" The charity said that line rental was the most expensive additional cost. The ISPA said that service providers using the BT network were required to levy a line rental charge, which went toward maintaining the network used by most of the UK for both phone calls and broadband. The report comes as Virgin Media was criticised by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) for one of its broadband adverts.

{"article": "Former five-weight world champion Mayweather faced UFC lightweight title-holder McGregor in Canada in front of 16,000 fans in Toronto. McGregor, 28, danced around the stage as he criticised 40-year-old Mayweather and his promoters. The pair will meet over 12 rounds under boxing rules on 26 August. In a series of expletive-laden outbursts, mixed martial arts star McGregor insulted Mayweather over his outfit and even suggested he couldn't read. \"How do I look?\" McGregor asked the crowd, before pointing at Mayweather's bag. \"He's 40! Dress your age, carrying a school bag on stage. \"What are you doing with a school bag on stage? You can't even read.\" Mayweather, dressed in a T-shirt and cap while McGregor wore a suit, replied: \"I'm the one that can't read? I do numbers, I make money,\" \"You owe money,\" McGregor responded, referring to reports that Mayweather asked the IRS earlier this month for more time to pay his 2015 tax bill. Undefeated Mayweather took an Irish flag from the crowd and paraded it in front of McGregor, before the Irishman threw it back in the boxer's face. Their head-to-head meeting was the second in a four-day international tour to four cities to promote the bout taking place at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The first publicity event took place in Los Angeles, where McGregor promised to knock out Mayweather inside four rounds, with the final two events taking place in New York and London. McGregor has never boxed as an amateur or professional. But his UFC coach John Kavanagh says the Irishman's boxing skills are improving all the time. Kavanagh said: \"We have gone through one training cycle and we had some good sparring partners in - and, as we expected, his skills transcended. \"He is not trying to win Wimbledon. It's not that different. \"His understanding of range, his understanding of how to move around is excellent.\" He added: \"The first half has gone very well and I am heading out to Vegas for the second half on Monday, and I am expecting him to peak at the right time.\"", "abstract": "Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor continued to trade insults on the second day of a media tour to promote their Las Vegas fight in August.", "candidate": "Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor traded insults at a press conference to promote their Las Vegas fight later this month.", "doc_id": 1801, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "McGregor hurled insults towards Mayweather at a press conference to promote their Las Vegas fight later this month.", "evidence": "In a series of expletive-laden outbursts, mixed martial arts star McGregor insulted Mayweather over his outfit and even suggested he couldn't read.", "explanation": "Both names of McGregor and Mayweather did not include their first names in the source, and it was more of a McGregor insulting Mayweather situation and very one sided.", "instruction": "Remove the information about the first name of Mayweather, \"Floyd\" from the summary.

{"article": "The St Athan Search and Rescue Helicopter Service was officially launched on Thursday. From its \u00a37m Vale of Glamorgan base, it will conduct land and sea missions previously carried out by the RAF. It started operating on 4 October and has so far completed eight missions. The new base is one of 10 being set up around the UK by 2017, with 22 helicopters set to conduct land and sea searches on behalf of HM Coastguard. A ten-year contract was awarded by the Department for Transport to Bristow Helicopters to deliver the service. Two of the new bases are in Wales, with one in Caernarfon, Gwynedd replacing RAF Valley and St Athan covering an area once served by helicopters from RAF Chivenor in Devon. There are two Agusta Westland AW139 helicopters based at St Athan, each worth around \u00a37.5m and fitted with night vision and state-of-the art medical equipment. \"We aim to be ready to fly within 15 minutes of the call in the day and 45 minutes at night. But for the last emergency we were airborne in seven minutes,\" said Capt Olly Padbury. \"We also had a call within 45 minutes of going live on 4 October, so it shows the importance of the service.\" The 30-person team will be on 24-hour call and cover an area that runs roughly between mid Wales, Bude in Cornwall, Oxford and London. Capt Padbury said the base's location meant the two helicopters could get quickly to areas that receive large amounts of emergency calls- such as Worm's Head on Gower, Fishguard in Pembrokeshire and Woolacombe Beach in Devon. Moving at speeds of roughly 160mph, the crew travelled to Weston-Super-Mare, Somerset, in seven minutes to answer a call of a man stuck in mud recently. Other call-outs have been to a horse rider who fell in west Wales and someone who had fallen at Cheddar Gorge, Somerset. Another recent mission was to aid the Central Beacons Mountain Rescue Team, who made an emergency call after a walker fell near Ystradfellte, Powys and had a pelvis injury. Richard Parkes, the director of maritime operations at the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, called the base launch a \"bittersweet\" moment. He praised the previous rescue work conducted from Chivenor, saying: \"A high benchmark has been set by the RAF through 70 years of search and rescue. \"The challenge is to emulate it.\"", "abstract": "Rescues of a fallen horse rider, someone trapped in a gorge and a man stuck in mud are among the first missions completed by a new helicopter unit.", "candidate": "A new search and rescue helicopter service has been launched in south Wales.", "doc_id": 1804, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "A new search and rescue helicopter service has been launched in Wales.", "evidence": "The St Athan Search and Rescue Helicopter Service was officially launched on Thursday.", "explanation": "Doesn't narrow down the location to south wales only, has calls in other areas of wales.", "instruction": "Replace the information about south Wales with the information about Wales.", "instruction_list": ["Replace the information about south Wales with the information about Wales."]}}
{"article": "Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - a charity worker accused of security offences - was detained while trying to leave the country with her baby daughter after visiting relatives in April 2016. Her family denies she broke any laws. Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, who is from London, said his wife's detention was a \"stain\" on Iran. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38, who works for the charity the Thomson Reuters Foundation, has been detained in Iran since her arrest last year. The couple's two-year-old daughter has remained in Iran after the government confiscated her passport, and is being looked after by her grandparents. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family said in September that a Revolutionary Court had handed down the five-year term. She was accused of allegedly plotting to topple the government in Tehran, but the official charges against her were not made public. According to Mr Ratcliffe, his wife's appeal was dismissed in a secret hearing of an Iranian Revolutionary Court on 4 January but only announced on 22 January. In a statement, her husband said the precise charges against her remain secret, but that two new accusations were made at her appeal. One was that she had been head of recruitment for the BBC's Farsi service when it was launched in 2009. Her family say she worked on a BBC training project for youth in Afghanistan and Iran, but never worked for BBC Farsi. The other charge was that she was married to a British spy. Mr Ratcliffe is an accountant. Monique Villa, chief executive of Thomson Reuters Foundation said she is \"outraged by this new mockery of justice\", and reiterated Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe never worked for BBC Farsi and that her husband \"is not a spy but a reputable accountant\". \"I am fully convinced of Nazanin's innocence,\" she added. Francesca Unsworth, BBC World Service Group director, said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had briefly worked for charity BBC Media Action in a \"junior administrative capacity\" but had never worked for BBC Persian. \"In any case, to suggest that being employed by BBC Persian is tantamount to 'acting against national security' is patently ludicrous,\" Ms Unsworth added. Mr Ratcliffe said: \"The lack of justice in Nazanin's case continues to be a stain on Iran. The continued attempt to frame Nazanin behind secrets and lies brings shame. \"It is a needless waste of a mother and child's life for their own political bargains and economic interests.\" Iran does not recognize dual nationalities, meaning those detained cannot receive consular assistance.

{"article": "Their last home game, a 4-0 win over Droylsden, attracted 142 supporters and after staff and players were paid, the Tigers were left with \u00a321 profit. Last week, the club issued an appeal for \u00a325,000 so they could \"stay in a solvent position\" until the summer. \"There are fans out there but if they don't come back then we're not going to have a team,\" said Hughes. The club's owner, Eamonn McGurk, has supported the club financially since they struggled to pay a tax bill of more than \u00a380,000 in the 1990s. It is estimated his investment runs to more than \u00a31m, in addition to funding the planning costs for a new ground. The Blue Square Bet North club have been without a home for six years after their Meadow Park ground was destroyed by flooding and their nomadic status has played a major part in their financial difficulties. They have shared with local clubs Forest Green Rovers, Cirencester and most recently Cheltenham Town - where they have been based since 2010. But Hughes believes their move out of the city, and the historical rivalry the Tigers have with Cheltenham, has caused fans to abandon their local club. \"If I had \u00a310 for every time I've spoken to someone who has said 'I used to support Gloucester but I'm not going to come back until you've returned to Gloucester', I'd probably be able to sustain the club,\" he told BBC Gloucestershire. \"There's always been this rivalry across the divide but Cheltenham are a Football League club now and that's what we've always wanted to aspire to. \"We've been fortunate that Cheltenham allowed us to have a ground share - they could have said no.\" Gloucester pay \u00a340,000 a year to play at Whaddon Road, but were recently threatened with eviction after failing to meet payments. The issue is close to being resolved and Gloucester hope to have a deal in place next week to remain in Cheltenham for next season's campaign. Plans for a new stadium at the Meadow Park site were submitted to Gloucester City Council in 2011, but have yet to be approved. \"It has left me so frustrated,\" Hughes added. \"There's been a lot of money spent on reports etc [for new stadium] and it's been draining. \"It's been difficult.

The film has made more than $50 million (\u00c2\u00a327 million) in North America, according to the Box Office Mojo site, and has just been released on DVD and Blu-ray. McQueen's film tells of how a free-born black man, played by British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor, is kidnapped and forced into slavery before finally winning his freedom 12 years later. Interest in Northup's 19th Century memoir has been revived following the success of the film, with many public high schools adding it to their curricula and reading lists.

Money raised will support three charities Mr Cox said were close to his wife's heart - the Royal Voluntary Service, Hope not Hate and the White Helmets.

{"article": "The announcement reignited a long-running debate about Hermione's race with many pointing out that the character's skin colour is never specified by author JK Rowling. In the books, she is described more often by her personality traits than her physical appearance. She's clever and loyal and a valued friend. Many people associate Hermione with Emma Watson who played her in the films. But some argue that it makes sense for Hermione to be black because of the challenges she goes through. The character fights a constant battle against prejudice because she was born to non-wizarding parents. This casts her as an outsider in a world where wizards of \"pure\" blood are seen by some to be superior, and \"mudbloods\" like Hermione are looked down upon. Online, Art by Harry Potter fans depicting Hermione as black or non-white has been circulating on sites like Tumblr for a while. Representations of other well known characters in film and literature as a race they are not typically associated with are also popular. It's known as \"racebending\". Marianne Khalil is one artist who decided to draw Hermione as black. She says she originally did it as a gift for a friend but \"because Hermione is never explicitly stated to be white in the text, there's an opportunity to create representation where there wasn't previously.\" \"It's important that Hermione can be read as a woman of colour, and all of these artworks depicting her as such are reclaiming that for the people who lost representation to the films.\" Writer Chantell Monique describes herself as a dedicated enthusiast of Harry Potter. She says it wasn't a surprise to see Hermione cast as a black actress. \"I was just like 'of course she'd be black'.\" But she says challenging the norm is important. \"Seeing the actress for me is like coming home. There's a comfort to it that I didn't even realise.\" \"I've always connected to Hermione but having her look like me, or my mother, or my aunt is amazing.\" Cousins Robyn Jordan and Bayana Davis run a website called Black Girls Nerd Out. It centres on identity in fan culture and explores how identity is portrayed. They say this announcement is definitely something to be celebrated. They've both been Harry Potter fans since they were children. While they both could, and did, identify with Hermione, they always saw her as white. Bayana says it's great now to literally be able to see herself in the character. \"So much media out there that reinforces the idea that white people can be anything and do anything and we don't get that as much for black characters and black people.\" Robyn added \"Moving away from the fact that a character default is white is important. Representation in general is a big deal.\" Ebony Elizabeth Thomas is an assistant professor specializing in children's literature at the University of Pennsylvania. In the past, she has written some of her own Potter fan fiction. She says she cried when she saw the casting. For her, this is revolutionary. \"What this signals is that race doesn't necessarily have to be the defining characteristic of a human being. What is essential about Hermione is not her skin tone, what's essential about her is that she's smart.\" Thomas says she's noticing a definite shift towards what she calls colour blind casting. The Broadway musical Hamilton, based on the life of founding father Alexander Hamilton, is a great example, says Thomas. Actor Lin-Manuel Miranda currently plays the lead role. He is of Puerto Rican descent. Thomas says depicting one of America's founding fathers as anything other than white would have been difficult until recently. \"In a world where Alexander Hamilton can be Puerto Rican then why can't Hermione be black?\"", "abstract": "Black actress Noma Dumezweni has been cast as Hermione Granger in the upcoming production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, a move celebrated by fans who have long explored the concept of a black Hermione.", "candidate": "Harry Potter fans have been reacting to the news that Hermione will be played by a black actress.", "doc_id": 1821, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "Harry Potter fans have been reacting to the news that Hermione could be played by a black actress.", "evidence": "Online, Art by Harry Potter fans depicting Hermione as black or non-white has been circulating on sites like Tumblr for a while.", "explanation": "It appears that there is a misunderstanding between the source which discusses fans ideas of how the character could be play by a black actress, not reacting to the news that there will be a black actress.", "instruction": "Modify the information about that Hermione WILL be played by a black actress to COULD be played in the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Modify the information about that Hermione WILL be played by a black actress to COULD be played in the summary."]}}
{"article": "Mr Whittingdale has been chair of the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport select committee for a decade. One of his first duties will be to oversee negotiations for the BBC's charter renewal. He has described the TV licence as \"worse than a poll tax\", although he has said it is likely to survive until at least the 2020s. He will also face the prospect of cuts to his department - the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) - as the new government seeks to eliminate the national budget deficit. And press regulation will be on his agenda. He has previously argued against statutory regulation of the press and said the Leveson Inquiry into media ethics \"strayed\" far beyond its remit. When it comes to understanding the brief, you would be hard pressed to find anyone better. Previous appointments have suggested the department was seen as a post to test out rising stars to see if they were up to running one of the big government departments. John Whittingdale's appointment is different. He is there to do a specific job - decide the future of the BBC. He is no fan of the licence fee, but has said he accepts it will probably survive for the next 10 years. And secondly, almost forgotten now - the issue of press regulation lurks. His summoning of Rupert Murdoch to the culture committee was one of the key moments in the hacking scandal. But anyone waiting for further action to enforce a \"Leveson-compliant\" system of press regulation will probably have to wait a good while longer. Figures from the media and arts worlds have been reacting to his appointment on Twitter: . The BBC's royal charter determines the level of the licence fee, currently \u00c2\u00a3145.50, and the other terms under which the corporation operates. The current charter will run out at the end of 2016. As culture secretary, Mr Whittingdale will lead the government's negotiations with the BBC over its renewal. In February, Mr Whittingdale concluded that the TV licence is \"becoming harder and harder to justify\" given changes to technology. As the culture select committee published a report into the future of the BBC, he said there appeared to be \"no realistic alternative to the licence fee\" in the short term, but that the BBC must prepare for the possibility of a change in the 2020s. It could be replaced by a compulsory levy on all households, or be reduced, with some BBC services only available by subscription, the report suggested. In October, he said the licence fee was \"actually worse than a poll tax because under the poll tax, if you were on a very low income you would get a considerable subsidy\", according to The Daily Telegraph. A BBC spokesperson said: \"We're looking forward to working with the new secretary of state.\" Last November, Mr Whittingdale's committee also published a report into the way Arts Council England funds cultural organisations. It concluded that there was a \"clear funding imbalance\" in favour of the capital, and urged Arts Council England to \"restore some balance\" across the country. Arts Council England is funded by the DCMS. However, many in the arts world are braced for further funding reductions as the government seeks to eliminate the budget deficit without raising VAT, income tax or National Insurance.

{"article": "When the hand of God strikes, nudging a major GCSE exam into the path of an England World Cup match, it can be a teachers' worst nightmare. A clash with the Muslim month of fasting may also cause concern in some schools wanting their pupils to do their best. And as exam timetabling is something of a long game, there can be no last-minute changes to scheduling to take into account a major football fixture. With so much hype over world sporting events such as the Olympics or the World Cup, most people will want to watch, says former exams doctor George Turnbull. \"With the best will in the world, it is very difficult to talk young people down from taking time out of their revision to watch such events, and staying up late is not the best way to prepare for examinations,\" says the former adviser for exams regulator Ofqual. \"Of course young people should be preparing long before hand, but we all know that it doesn't always work like that . The exam itself should be the major event because it has so much potential to affect the young person's life chances,\" he adds. The public exams timetable is drawn up by the Joint Council for Qualifications at least 18 months in advance of the exams themselves, following consultations with a wide range of stakeholders including religious groups, schools and colleges. And because of the narrow window in which exam boards can hold examinations and get them marked, they are always in a fixed period of six weeks in the education calendar. The JCQ has reiterated that there were only minimal changes carried out to the draft timetable for 2016 before it was published. \"In such a large, complex system where there is a large number of candidates taking examinations and a diverse range of subjects available, it is not always possible to meet each and every request,\" it says. \"Exam boards will always aim to be as fair as possible to all. \"If a small change can be made for any one group that does not impact negatively on most students, it will, quite rightly, be considered - but these are made before the timetable is published.\" And even as that timetable is drawn up, there is very little room for manoeuvre, says Andrew Harland, chief executive of the Exam Officers' Association. He cites the example of one local authority that complained, unsuccessfully, their students were going to have to sit a maths exam during their half-term holiday. Exam boards have to get GCSE papers marked in time for schools and colleges to decide places on sixth-form courses, he explains. Equally, A-level papers need to be graded so universities can confirm places to potential undergraduates. In recent years, the exam season has moved from June to July to late May to June, in part, to enable boards to get enough markers. Mr Harland says exams used to run up to the end of term, when people were going on holiday. \"The days of markers taking a bundle of papers down to a cottage in Cornwall are over, as marking has moved online,\" he says. There may be a few cases where students taking unusual sets of subjects may have exam clashes, Mr Harland says. This can mean they have to take a paper at a later time of day and will thus need supervision so the integrity of the examination paper is maintained. But the major change in exam timetabling in recent years has been to what he describes as a \"one-hit summer exam system\" in which all exams are taken at the end of a two-year period and retakes have been discouraged. This, he argues, has put even more pressure on exam boards to get timetabling right first time.", "abstract": "As it emerges that GCSE and A-level exam timetables have been drawn up to minimise clashes with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, we take a look at what influences and restricts scheduling.", "candidate": "It's that time of year again - exam timetabling season.", "doc_id": 1824, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "And as exam timetabling is something of a long game, there can be no last-minute changes to scheduling to take into account a major football fixture.", "explanation": "The source talks about the exam timetabling and then goes on to discuss later on about the time of year and the season for exam taking, so the summary agrees with what the source said.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

The pair spent seven days in France before they were spotted in Bordeaux and the girl was returned home. Her mother said she wanted to put the record straight about what happened. She has written a book, The Runaway Schoolgirl, about the events since the pair crossed the Channel to France in September 2012. \"I had no intention of speaking to the press,\" she said. \"Then over time with all this stuff being published about my family that was untrue, I could see the despair on my children's faces and the effect it was having on them so I just had enough. \"For their sake\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I had to put the record straight and stop this.\" She said everyone thought the family's nightmare was over when her daughter came home to East Sussex but it was just beginning. \"We were literally invaded with calls for interviews and people turning up at our house, notes being put through our door,\" she said. \"My youngest daughter was being bullied at school and my eldest son having to lose his job because he couldn't cope with the attention he was getting. \"So I know people will assume it was all done and dusted and everything but it was never that and even today we're still going through it.\" Lewes Crown Court heard the maths teacher groomed the girl at his Eastbourne school. He was convicted of child abduction and admitted sex offence charges. The trial heard the pupil had just turned 15 when Forrest started a sexual relationship with her and they had sex in his car, in hotels and at his marital home. Fearing they were about to be exposed, Forrest booked them on a cross-Channel ferry from Dover to Calais. The mother said she was not prepared to talk about how the girl is at the moment. \"Through my investigations into child grooming... children who are groomed do take many years to actually come to terms with what's happened to them and, until that point starts, the healing process can't happen,\" she said. \"The people who are doing this grooming are so cold and calculating in the way they do it. It's really difficult for parents to pick up on. \"When it came about I had no idea.\" She said Forrest rang her and and told her there were rumours the pair were having a relationship. \"And then with that he completely broke down - he was sobbing, he was blaming her, saying she was going to ruin his life, she's going to ruin his career - his marriage is on the rocks,\" she said. \"I found myself in a situation where I was counselling him - going, 'You don't have to worry.

{"article": "He died at his home in Cambridge following an illness lasting several months, a statement on his website said. It added his funeral will be private, with a memorial service to be held at a later date. Hogwood worked with many leading orchestras around the world and was considered one of the most influential exponents of the early-music movement. The conductor founded the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) in 1973 and directed the academy across six continents for some 30 years. The AAM also made more than 200 CDs, including the first-ever complete cycle of Mozart symphonies on period instruments. Among his most famous recordings include the 1980 version of Handel's Messiah with Emma Kirkby and Carolyn Watkinson, which was named by BBC Music Magazine as one of the top 20 recordings of all time. Hogwood studied keyboard at Cambridge University with Rafael Puyana and Mary Potts and later with Zuzana Ruzickova and Gustav Leonhardt. His first positions were as a keyboard player and musicologist with the Academy of Saint Martin-in-the-Fields under Sir Neville Marriner, and was a founder member of the Early Music Consort of London. He was the artistic director of the King's Lynn Festival and Boston's Handel and Haydn Society. He was also a tutor at Harvard University, honorary professor of music at the University of Cambridge and a professor-at-large at Cornell University in the US. \"Christopher had extraordinary generosity of spirit,\" Christopher Purvis, honorary president of the AAM, said. \"He was a great ambassador for historically informed music, the movement of which he was a founder. And he was happy to see the orchestra he founded develop and grow after he stepped down as director.\" The AAM's music director Richard Egarr added: \"I am deeply saddened by the news of Christopher's passing. Christopher provided a fantastic legacy for me to build upon when I joined in 2006 and I know he will be greatly missed by all who knew and worked with him.\" Speaking to Sean Rafferty on Radio 3's In Tune, soprano Dame Emma Kirkby said: \"Some of the best players that now lead orchestras all over the world, they started with him. \"Chris was a natural academic, an incredibly clever man.

{"article": "At a rally in his hometown of Hope, Arkansas, Mr Huckabee used the phrase \"hope to higher ground\" as a motif. The bass guitar-playing, foreign policy hawk has had a media career since losing the nomination in 2008. He joins a crowded Republican field that includes three senators, a businesswoman and a neurosurgeon. \"Folks, it is a long way from a little brick rent house on Second Street in Hope, Arkansas to the White House,\" he said. \"Here in this small town called Hope, I was raised to believe that where a person started didn't mean that's where he had to stop. I always believed that a kid could go from Hope to higher ground.\" After announcing his ambitions, the crowd erupted in cheers of \"We want Mike!\" The former Southern Baptist minister acknowledged his pro-gun-ownership position, telling the audience about receiving a BB gun at the age of five. He said the US Department of Education should be abolished, a position popular with conservatives who oppose recent national education reforms. On immigration, he said the US borders should be secured, but was short on details. And he reaffirmed his steadfast opposition to same-sex marriage. Mike Huckabee is back. Eight years ago he launched a surprisingly successful presidential bid, finishing second to Arizona Senator John McCain and winning the Iowa caucuses and seven other states. Four years ago rumours abounded that Mr Huckabee was going to run again. Supporters and analysts watched and waited... and waited. The former Arkansas governor, who had a well-paying job as a television and radio host, opted to sit out the campaign, despite some polls showing him leading the Republican field. He said his \"heart says no\". Now, however, Mr Huckabee's heart is saying yes. He has quit his media commitments and is diving into the 2016 race. He'll meet a much more crowded field than would have faced him in 2012, however, both in the total number of candidates and in opponents who will compete with him for the evangelical voters who buoyed his 2008 campaign. Mr Huckabee has a lot going for him - name recognition, a developed fundraising network and experience from his previous presidential campaign. But given the strength of his Republican opponents - new, engaging and also well-funded - will that be enough? Early in his speech, Mr Huckabee noted that he was the first male in his family to graduate from high school. \"My dad wasn't an educated man, but he was a smart man. And he and my mother didn't have a whole lot, but they had honesty to the bone,\" he said. As his campaign gets under way, Mr Huckabee could face challenges within his own party. Many conservatives will not like the fact that overall, taxes and spending went up during his time as Arkansas governor. In 2008, Mr Huckabee won eight primaries in socially conservative states but this time he has vowed to focus more on the economy and national security. To win the Republican crown, he will have to overcome Senators Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, as well as former Hewlett-Packard boss Carly Fiorina and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.

Shadow Home Secretary Andy Burnham said \"those responsible must be held to account\". Calling for transparency about clashes between miners and police at Orgreave earlier in the 1980s, Mr Burnham said there had been a \"27-year cover-up\". He said he did not believe the Hillsborough families would have the \"full truth\" until \"we know the truth about Orgreave\". Ms May said it was not possible for MPs to understand what the Hillsborough families had been through. How the truth was uncovered . Live updates and reaction . Hillsborough: From tragedy to truth . What happens next? She said for 27 years the families and survivors \"fought for justice from the authorities that should have been trusted, and have laid blame and tried to protect themselves.\" The families \"have never faltered\", she said, and commended their courage, determination and resolve. \"No-one should have to endure what the families and survivors have been through and no-one should have to fight for year after year and decade after decade for the truth.\" She said: \"Clearly the jury's determination that those who died were unlawfully killed is of great public importance.\" \"It overturns in the starkest way possible the verdict of accidental death returned at the original inquests. \"However, the jury's findings do not, of course, amount to a finding of criminal liability, and no-one should impute criminal liability to anyone while the ongoing investigations are still pending.\" She read out the potential offences under investigation including gross negligence manslaughter, misconduct in a public office, perjury and perverting the course of justice. David Cameron said the inquests' conclusion \"marked a momentous day for the family and friends of the 96 victims\". He said: \"Over the last 27 years, their search for justice has been met with obfuscation and hostility, instead of sympathy and answers. \"As I said to the House in 2012 about the Hillsborough Independent Panel's report, it's wrong that the families had to wait for so long and to fight so hard just to get to the truth. \"I know the whole house will want to join me in praising their courage, their patience and their resolve. They've never faltered in the pursuit of the truth and we all owe them a great debt of gratitude.\" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn paid tribute to the \"dignity\" of campaigning relatives, praising their \"steadfastness and determination\". Mr Burnham said there were three reasons how \"something so obvious\" was finally outlined 27 years later in the inquest jury's conclusions. He said: \"First, a police force which has consistently put protecting itself above protecting people harmed by Hillsborough. \"Second, collusion between that force and complicit print media. Third, a flawed judicial system that gives the upper hand to those in authority over and above ordinary people.\" The politicians were speaking after calls were made for senior police officers to be held accountable for the disaster. South Yorkshire Police said the force had made \"a full apology\" for its failures in 2012 and had \"stood by that ever since\".

The paper has long been criticised for running a front-page story headlined \"The Truth\" after the disaster, alleging some fans had picked victims' pockets and urinated on police.

Dozens of other families have also been told their loved ones' body parts were kept by the force.

His family buried him believing his body was intact, and were unaware his stomach, liver and other tissues had been retained after two post-mortem examinations until police officers visited them in September last year. His mother, Jennifer Shaw, said she wanted to know why it had taken so long to come to light. \"He's my son.

It became illegal in 2006 to remove or store human tissue without families' consent following an investigation at Liverpool's Alder Hey hospital in 1999. Organs from hundreds of babies who died at the hospital were secretly taken. The body parts kept for Greater Manchester Police were removed before that date.

{"article": "Researchers at the University of Sheffield said the tumours were effectively \"fertilising\" the bone to help themselves grow. The study, in the journal Nature, said it may be possible to protect bone from a tumour's nefarious influence and consequently stop the cancer's spread. Cancer charities said this opened up \"a whole new avenue for research\". Around 85% of breast cancers that spread around the body end up in bone, at which point the cancer is difficult to treat and more deadly. The scientists, in Sheffield and the University of Copenhagen, discovered patients with secondary cancers had higher levels of an enzyme called LOX being produced by their tumours and released into the blood. Bone is constantly being broken down and rebuilt. But in a series of experiments on mice, the research team showed LOX was disrupting the process and leaving lesions and holes in the bone. Using drugs to block LOX prevented the cancer from spreading. Dr Alison Gartland, a reader in bone and cancer biology at the university, told the BBC News website: \"We think it's a significant breakthrough in trying to prevent metastases (secondary tumours) in breast cancer. \"The cancer cells in the primary tumour are actually fertilising the soil for the future growth of itself, LOX is changing the environment in bone to make it better to grow.\" The animal tests also showed that a set of osteoporosis drugs called bisphosphonates could prevent the spread of cancer. Bisphosphonates also interfere with the way bone is recycled in order to strengthen it. They are already given to some cancer patients, but the Sheffield team believe they could have a much larger role. The effect was discovered only in oestrogen-negative breast cancers. They account for around a third of cases, but are far more deadly. Katherine Woods, from Breast Cancer Campaign and Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: \"By unveiling the role that the protein LOX is playing, these results open up a whole new avenue for research and treatments that could stop breast cancer spreading to the bone. \"The research also adds weight to the growing body of evidence supporting the role of bisphosphonates in stopping secondary breast cancer in its tracks. \"The reality of living with secondary breast cancer in the bone is a stark one, which leaves many women with bone pain and fractures that need extensive surgery just when they need to be making the most of the time they have left with friends and family.\" The findings may also apply in colon cancer.", "abstract": "Breast cancers can manipulate the structure of bone to make it easier to spread there, a study has found.", "candidate": "Scientists say they have made a \"breakthrough\" discovery about breast cancers that spread to the bone.", "doc_id": 1849, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "Dr Alison Gartland, a reader in bone and cancer biology at the university, told the BBC News website: \"We think it's a significant breakthrough in trying to prevent metastases (secondary tumours) in breast cancer.", "explanation": "The source text indicates that \"scientists\" discovered patients with secondary cancers have higher levels of LOX.

{"article": "The announcement of the coaching changes at Surrey on the day of the Australia-Sri Lanka Champions Trophy game at The Oval meant juggling meetings and phone calls with stints in the commentary box for Test Match Special. It was an 18-hour rollercoaster and I must admit there will be a few more similar lengthy working days ahead for me. Sport can be a ruthless business and both Chris Adams and Ian Salisbury have been thanked for their efforts over the last four and half years by Surrey as the club now looks to move things forward in a new direction. My new role is to oversee professional cricket at the club. Due to my other working commitments, I will not be at every day of every match but I will be putting structures in place for the immediate future and beyond while our bowling coach Stuart Barnes will step up and run the side on a day-to-day basis. With good communication and planning we're optimistic that this new-set up can help take the team forward while the club seeks a long-term successor to Chris. The Champions Trophy has delivered two fascinating semi-finals this week, with England taking on South Africa at The Oval on Wednesday before India and Sri Lanka meet in Cardiff the following day. Alastair Cook's men will have their work cut out to overcome a South Africa side who seem to be growing into the tournament. Despite the loss of Graeme Smith, Jacques Kallis and Morne Morkel, they have stepped up to the mark, with Colin Ingram and David Miller showing against West Indies that they can be dangerous batsman at this level. Dale Steyn's return to fitness has given them added potency with the ball at just the right time, alongside useful contributions from Chris Morris and Ryan McLaren. England have reached the last four after sticking to a method that may have come in for a fair bit of criticism but has proved successful. Much of the scrutiny has focused on the top three batsmen and their perceived reluctance to play high-risk cricket, but I am more concerned by the lack of runs from the middle order to date. Ravi Bopara showed the way with his 13-ball 33 against Sri Lanka, but now is the time for Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler to come to the party. I think the new ball will be the key to deciding the outcome of this match. Can England's top order handle the pace and skill of Steyn? How will South Africa fare against Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad? My heart says England, but my head says South Africa. The all-Asian second semi-final is a repeat of the 2011 World Cup final and if it proves half as good a game as that was, the spectators in Cardiff will be in for a treat. Sri Lanka have shown they are a dangerous team with good wins over England and Australia, but India are a level above any other side in this tournament and I fully expect them to go on and reach the final. From numbers one to 11 they have played outstanding cricket. They are younger and hungrier than Indian sides of the past and their athletic fielding has added another dimension to their play. They have the tournament's outstanding batsman in Shikhar Dhawan and a richly-varied bowling attack that blends the pace of Ishant Sharma and the swing of Bhuvneshwar Kumar with the exceptional spin axis of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja. Sri Lanka will be looking to one of their proven match-winners - Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene or Lasith Malinga - to tilt things their way, but unless India have an off day, I can only see one winner.

{"article": "The Home Office decided to halt the Detained Fast Track (DFT) system amid concerns over safeguards, particularly for \"vulnerable applicants\". Immigration minister James Brokenshire said he hoped the DFT system would resume within weeks. It is thought about 800 applicants are affected - and can now seek bail. Of those, it is estimated that about 100 may have to be released. The system, introduced in 2000, accelerates legal hearings and appeals while keeping the individual detained. It is used in cases which officials believe can be decided quickly. Last month the Court of Appeal ordered the Home Office to halt the system immediately after an earlier High Court hearing concluded it contained \"structural unfairness\". High Court judge Mr Justice Nicol put a \"legal stay\" - a temporary delay - on his ruling on 12 June, following a case brought by campaign group Detention Action. This meant the fast-track system remained in operation until the government had exhausted all opportunities to appeal. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said officials were worried their procedures were not as robust as they should be. In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Brokenshire said the system had \"come under significant legal challenge\". \"Risks surrounding the safeguards within the system for particularly vulnerable applicants have also been identified to the extent that we cannot be certain of the level of risk of unfairness to certain vulnerable applicants who may enter DFT. \"In light of these issues, I have decided to temporarily suspend the operation of the detained fast-track policy. \"I hope this pause to be short in duration, perhaps only a matter of weeks, but I will only resume operation of this policy when I am sure the right structures are in place to minimise any risk of unfairness.\" The decision to suspend the process means those asylum seekers detained and awaiting hearings will be reassessed at a \"senior level\" to see if they can be released from detention to continue their asylum application in the normal way. Mr Brokenshire added: \"Those who meet the general criteria for detention will not be directly affected by the decision to suspend DFT. \"Many are already detained under these powers, for example because they are at risk of absconding and face imminent removal. \"Only if detention can no longer be justified outside a DFT process will applicants be released to continue their asylum claim in the regular asylum system.\" He said applicants who face removal to a safe third country, pose a risk to the public or are foreign offenders are \"still liable to be detained or remain detained\".

Mr Duncan Smith said: \"We had a vote, that vote now has to be acted on.\" The dispute came after Sir John, Conservative prime minister between 1990 and 1997, called for the 48% of people who voted against Brexit in June's referendum to have their views considered. \"The tyranny of the majority has never applied in a democracy - and it should not apply in this particular democracy,\" he said. He argued that Parliament would have to ratify whatever deal is finally reached by the Brexit negotiators and there could be a case for a second referendum, depending on the deal on offer. Mr Duncan Smith told BBC Radio 5 live's Emma Barnett: \"The idea we delay everything just simply because they disagree with the original result does seem to me an absolute dismissal of democracy. \"And that's what I thought John Major's comments were today. The tyranny of the majority? What's the tyranny?\" Bernard Jenkin, a Conservative MP and leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign, also dismissed Sir John's talk of a second referendum. \"The idea this particular genie can be put back in the bottle after the British people have voted in a year-long debate - that we are now going to vote to stay in the EU - is absolute rubbish,\" he said. Mr Jenkin argued that the UK could have avoided Brexit if Sir John had held a referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, which was responsible for the creation of the European Union almost 25 years ago. \"If he had stopped the Maastricht Treaty, there would have been no monetary union, there would have been no eurozone crisis, no bailouts, no centralisation of power in the EU - we might even still be a member of the EU,\" he told the BBC. \"And it's because he gave in on the Maastricht Treaty that we've had to finish up leaving the EU.\" Liberal Democrat MP Nick Clegg, the former deputy prime minister, weighed in to add that while the government had a mandate to leave the EU, it did not have a mandate on \"how\" to leave. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World at One, he criticised what he called the \"almost hysterical fervour of the hard Brexiteers\" to turn Britain into \"a low regulation, low tax, enlarged offshore Singapore for which they have no mandate\". He insisted it was \"quite right that people, particularly from the centre ground point of British politics, say: 'Hang on a minute, that's actually not what people necessarily voted for on 23 June'.\" He added: \"Brexit yes, but not this very hard ideological Brexit that they seem determined to pursue.\"", "abstract": "Ex-Prime Minister Sir John Major has been accused of \"an absolute dismissal\" of democracy after he suggested there should be a second Brexit vote.", "candidate": "Former prime minister Sir John Major has been accused of \"absolute dismissal\" of democracy after he said there could be a second referendum on Brexit.", "doc_id": 1872, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "He argued that Parliament would have to ratify whatever deal is finally reached by the Brexit negotiators and there could be a case for a second referendum, depending on the deal on offer.", "explanation": "The accusation is supported, all names, designations and actions are supported.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}
{"article": "Its attorney general says the new version is fundamentally the same as the first, calling it \"Muslim Ban 2.0\". The directive, which takes effect on 16 March, places a 90-day ban on people from six mainly Muslim nations and a 120-day ban on all refugees. The previous order, which was blocked by a federal court, sparked confusion at airports and mass protests. \"Nothing of substance has changed: There is the same blanket ban on entry from Muslim-majority countries (minus one),\" Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin said of the new order. It will bar entry of citizens of Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days. Iraq, which was included in the first ban, has been taken off the list. Mr Chin also said the directive included \"the same sweeping shutdown of refugee admissions (absent one exception) and lawless warren of exceptions and waivers\", despite the changes made. The new order lifts an indefinite ban on those from Syria. It will also no longer affect legal US permanent residents, and drops controversial language about giving priority to religious minorities. These amendments were introduced in response to legal complaints, which saw the first order blocked by US federal courts. Judges ruled that the ban was unconstitutional amid concerns it unfairly targeted Muslims, something the government denied. Hawaii was among a number of states who filed lawsuits against the original ban saying it would harm residents, businesses and schools. It filed a fresh complaint late on Wednesday, calling for an emergency block on the new order. A hearing is set for March 15, a day before the new ban is to go into effect. President Trump has not yet commented on Hawaii's latest legal bid, but has previously insisted he has the right to enact such an executive order and hit out at \"so political\" courts. Speaking to local news channel Khon 2, Mr Chin said the new ban had the same \"nation-of-origin discrimination problems\" as the first. He said this was a particularly sensitive issue in Hawaii because of memories of Japanese internment camps on the Pacific island during World War Two. Although the new directive sought to answer legal complaints, Mr Chin said it still constituted a \"Muslim ban\" because of the countries involved and statements from administration officials. In justifying the ban on Monday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said there are more than 300 refugees under investigation for potential terror offences. But no further details were given.

Set up by The Beatles in 1968 to release their songs and manage their creative affairs, Apple Corps was the first. The dispute dates back to 1980, when the George Harrison noticed an advert for a fledgling computer company in a magazine. The sides reached a deal in 1981 allowing Apple to use the name as long as it stuck to computers, while The Beatles' company would continue in the entertainment field. With the advent of iTunes and the iPod this changed and battle recommenced. A deal was finally struck in 2007 with Jobs' Apple taking full control of the brand, licensing certain trademarks back to Apple Corps. A popular sandwich bar in Birmingham faced the wrath of Hollywood with its choice of Hungry Hobbit as the name for its business. The cafe chose the name in honour of the author who grew up in the Moseley area. But in 2012 lawyers for the Saul Zaentz Company objected saying it was trademark infringement. A campaign ensued with actor Stephen Fry voicing support for the eatery. As of 2016 its name remains the same.

England had never won a series in Australia, but they followed a 39-28 victory in the first Test in Brisbane with a 23-7 triumph in Melbourne before completing the job in Sydney. Jones has guided them to nine successive wins, including the Grand Slam in the Six Nations, since replacing Stuart Lancaster in November after hosts England failed to get past the group phase of the 2015 Rugby World Cup.

The Lib Dem leader, who became the target of angry students for performing a U-turn on tuition fees after entering government in 2010, said: \"Liberal Democrats are committed to building a stronger economy and a fairer society, enabling people to get on in life. \"The Young Person's Bus Pass will ensure that young people looking to access education or training can do so in an affordable way, and I hope that bus companies will top up that discount to something even more generous.\" The deputy PM added: \"Young people are required to stay in school until they are 18, but we haven't done enough to give them the support that they need to do that - literally to help them get from A to B.\" He rejected reports that free bus travel for pensioners would be axed by the Lib Dems if they got into power \"not least because these bus passes help keep the buses running, and because we know how much older people rely on public transport\". But he did confirm that the young people's bus passes would be paid for by removing the free TV licences and winter fuel allowance from pensioners paying higher rate tax. \"I know there are people who say you mustn't touch so-called universal pensioner benefits because politically it's too risky. We don't agree. What are effectively benefits for the rich and retired cannot be justified when there are so many young people struggling to get on their feet.\" Other measures in the Lib Dems' 80-page document include 15 hours of free childcare for every two-year-old in England, a \"Daddy month\" of paternity leave and guaranteed education spending. The party is also promising to end imprisonment for people found carrying a small amount of drugs for personal use and to set up a commission to assess the effectiveness of current drugs laws and alternative approaches, including punishment by civil penalties rather than a criminal conviction and the case for licensed cannabis shops. All the plans are subject to approval by the party's annual conference in Glasgow in October, but are likely to form the bulk of the party's campaign manifesto next year.

Her daughter was 'her priority',\" it ruled. \"That is not the legal position,\" it said. \"People who are disabled themselves, or who are the primary carer of a disabled person, have a right to work within the protection afforded by the 1995 Act.\" The finding was appealed by the Ardoyne Association but the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. Maria McKeith said she was left in shock when she was made redundant. \"I did not ask for any special treatment and I did not welcome it,\" she said. \"I enjoyed coming to work, meeting people and being able to advise and help them and I knew my daughter was being cared for while I was at work.

This comes on top of claims of widespread corruption, recent student protests and a succession battle in the governing African National Congress. The marchers are using the hasthag #ZumaMustFall on social media. The #ZumaMustFall hashtag is a modification of #FeesMustFall which was used to organise protests against a rise in university fees. Before that, #RhodesMustFall was used to demand a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes was removed from the University of Cape Town's campus. \"It feels like the start of something big,\" a woman in her 50s called Lianda told me. It's the first protest she has been on since she saw friends and family killed during the 1976 Soweto uprising. For her it was important to join the demonstrations with her teenage daughters \"for the sake of their future\". So along with thousands of others she came to register her displeasure at the ANC leader, who some increasingly see as a political liability. But unlike the groundswell of protest that led to the recall of President Thabo Mbeke in 2008, Jacob Zuma still appears to have support within the National Executive Committee of the ANC. Earlier this week, the party's top brass went on TV to deliver a message to a South African public still reeling from the events of the past week, that they still support their president. Yet privately there is said to be considerable disquiet within the ANC. This may not be an Arab Spring but watch this space. The discontent is growing louder. The ANC has been in power since the end of apartheid in 1994 and won a landslide in general elections last year. However, the economy is struggling, unemployment is around 25% and many accuse ANC officials of corruption.

{"article": "Brusthom Ziamani, 19, from Camberwell, south London, was found guilty last month of preparing an act of terrorism. The court heard he was inspired by the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby and used the internet to research cadet bases. He converted to Islam in 2014 and became radicalised. Months later he was arrested in east London in a possession of a 12in knife and a hammer. Ziamani, who was 18 when held on the street in August last year as part of a joint police and MI5 intelligence operation, also had a black \"Islamic flag\" in his bag. Police say he visited his former girlfriend earlier that day, when he showed her his weapons and told her he intended to attack and kill soldiers. The trial heard he told her Michael Adebolajo - one of the men who murdered Fusilier Rigby in Woolwich, south-east London a year earlier - was a \"legend\". In his sentencing remarks, Judge Timothy Pontius told Ziamani: \"A realistic and sensible assessment of the whole of the evidence leads inescapably to the conclusion that this defendant, had he not, by sheer good fortune, been spotted and stopped by the police on the street in east London, would have carried out the intention he had so graphically expressed to his ex-girlfriend just a few hours before.\" He said Ziamani would have to serve at least two-thirds of his sentence before being eligible for parole, adding that he would extend the time he would spend on licence after his release by five years. Ziamani was born in London to Congolese parents and went to school in Peckham. His mother worked as a nursery nurse and his father was a psychiatric nurse. The defendant told the court that his parents, who are Jehovah's Witnesses, had found out he was a Muslim only when they had seen pictures of friends in Islamic clothes on his mobile phone. During the trial, jurors heard how Ziamani had fallen in with members of the extremist organisation al-Muhajiroun, after he was \"kicked out\" of his home after converting to Islam. Police say the group played a \"major role in influencing and shaping his radical views\" and he attended their demonstrations. The jury heard Mr Ziamani also put posts on Facebook supporting Sharia law and stating he was \"willing to die in the cause of Allah\". It was told Ziamani had been arrested in June last year on an unrelated matter and police found a ripped-up letter to his parents in his jeans pocket, in which he had written about mounting an attack on a British soldier. In the letter Ziamani stated because he had no means of getting out to Iraq or Syria he would wage war against the British government on UK soil. He was bailed, but refused to engage with officers from the government's anti-radicalisation programme, Prevent. Ziamani's lawyer, Naeem Mian, said his client was not an \"entrenched extremist\" but a young man who while destitute had been groomed by people who were \"more sophisticated and mature\" than him. \"It is worrying to say the least that those who groomed him are able to groom and radicalise a young man in such a short period of time,\" he said. \"On any view it is a tragic case because this young man will spend a long time in custody after which he will inevitably be unemployable. His foolish, naive acts have resulted in him throwing his life away at his tender age. He has nothing to look forward to now.\" When Ziamani was convicted last month, Commander Richard Walton of the Counter Terrorism Command described him as an \"impressionable young man who became radicalised then rapidly developed an extremist, violent mindset\".

{"article": "Several species' vision was studied by an international team to identify this ultra-violet (UV) sensitivity. The findings, published in the journal Conservation Biology, claimed habitats and migration could be disrupted. The flashes, or corona, occur when charge builds up in a cable and is released into the air. The international team, including scientists from University College London and the Arctic University of Norway, measured the spectrum of light emitted by these bursts of charge. They worked out that although the light was invisible to us, it contained wavelengths seen by many other mammals. \"Most mammals will let some [UV light] into their eye,\" explained UCL vision expert Prof Glen Jeffery, one of the lead researchers in this project. \"We're weird - us and monkeys - because we don't see UV. Most animals do.\" The first animal to reveal its UV sensitivity was the reindeer. And, as the researchers explained, reindeers' avoidance of the power lines running across the Arctic tundra was part of the inspiration for this project. Dr Nicholas Tyler, the other lead author, said it had been assumed that rather than avoiding the power cables themselves, animals steered clear of passages cut in forested areas before pylons were installed. \"Forest animals will not cross clear-cuts,\" he said. \"But for us in the Arctic, avoidance of power lines is difficult to explain - there are no trees, yet the reindeer still avoid the power lines.\" The animals keep as much as 5km (3 miles) from either side of the cables. \"This has been a mystery,\" Dr Tyler added. \"We have now come up with a mechanism [to explain it].\" This research required a detailed understanding of animal vision, which was where Prof Jeffery came in. Having discovered in 2011 that reindeer eyes were sensitive to UV light, Prof Jeffery went on to study the eyes of almost 40 mammal species, revealing all were UV-sensitive. Since, as the researchers added, coronas \"happen on all power lines everywhere\", the avoidance of the flashes could be having a global impact on wildlife. \"It has always been assumed that power lines - masts and the cables strung between them - were passive structures standing immobile in the terrain, and therefore inoffensive for animals,\" said Dr Tyler. \"As a result of this work, we now consider them as chains of flashing light stretching across the tundra in the winter darkness, and that's why the animals find them so offensive.\" The random and unpredictable nature of these flashes were particularly problematic, he added, as the animals could not easily adapt to them.

The Conservative politician was in Scotland a day after the Scottish government published its draft independence referendum bill. He met his Scottish government counterpart Michael Russell for talks. When asked if the First Minister is being \"realistic\" with her demands, he said: \"They are both reserved powers. Immigration and international affairs are both reserved powers.\" Before the EU referendum in June, leading Brexit campaigner and then justice secretary Michael Gove had suggested Scotland could get powers over immigration as part of a deal to leave the EU. But Mr Davis said: \"It's hard to see how a separate immigration policy would work.\" He insisted the Brexit arrangements would be a \"United Kingdom deal\", rejecting the idea put forward by the Scottish Government that the country should be able to keep its place in the European single market. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said a referendum will be called if it is felt necessary to \"protect Scotland's interests\" in the wake of the Brexit vote. But she has insisted her government was \"exploring all of the options\" for safeguarding Scotland's place in Europe, and has said she will publish proposals in the coming weeks for keeping Scotland in the European single market even if the UK leaves. After his first meeting with Mr Davis, Mr Russell said he expected to soon be able to announce a formal process for Scottish input into the Brexit process. Speaking at Strathclyde University in Glasgow, Mr Davis said while it has \"got to be a United Kingdom deal\", it would \"incorporate protection for the people of Scotland\". He also said the eventual agreement would \"reflect the interests of the people of Scotland\". Mr Davis stated: \"The aim is to get the maximum possible barrier-free access to the European Union market, as well as being able to get other markets globally. \"How we achieve that? We're not at that stage yet, but that's the aim.\" He continued: \"I don't think the Scottish people want another referendum, but that's for them. \"I have simply got the single aim in front of me, which is to get the best deal possible, and that includes the best deal for the Scottish people.\" Yesterday the Prime Minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, said that he thinks the United Kingdom might actually rein back on Brexit.

{"article": "The regulator has agreed to increase the amount of weight graphite bricks at the core of the reactor at Dungeness B in Kent will be allowed to lose. The bricks, which degrade over time due to radiation, are vital for safety. The Office for Nuclear Regulation said it was a \"robust\" body but one expert accused it of \"moving the goalposts\". The nuclear reactor at Dungeness B would have breached the safety margin within months which could have forced the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) to prosecute or even shut it down. The safety margins cover thousands of graphite bricks at the core of Britain's 14 elderly Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors (AGRs). But the bricks, each about a metre in height, are both cracking and starting to lose weight due to decades of radiation, and that could affect safety. The current graphite weight loss limit for Dungeness is set at 6.2% but the regulator says when it reached 5.7% its operator, French power giant EDF, applied to raise it to 8%. Mark Foy, deputy chief inspector at the Office for Nuclear Regulation, said \"We will be in a position to agree that 8% limit within the next few weeks. Ageing is a nuclear safety issue\". As part of that ageing process the licensee was required to monitor and inspect the reactors regularly. Steve Thomas, professor of energy policy at the University of Greenwich, said: \"It doesn't feel good when we come up against limits and the first thing they [the ONR] do is to move the goalposts.\" Mr Foy stressed that the ONR was a \"robust regulator\" and due process had been followed. \"If we feel the evidence they [EDF] have supplied is robust and sufficient to underpin the 8% case then we will agree it,\" he said. The graphite bricks are integral to UK nuclear power stations and they act to moderate the nuclear reaction; it will not function without them. The bricks cannot be replaced which means they are being carefully monitored as the reactors age. They become damaged through years of intense bombardment by radiation and effects of the coolant CO2 on the material. A distortion to the graphite core could prevent the control rods being inserted, which shut down the reactor in an emergency. EDF said \"safety of the public and our employees is our overriding priority\" and the company took a \"cautious approach\" working closely with the regulator and they operated with \"very conservative safety margins\" and safety requirements were \"stringent\". But in shifting the graphite limit Dungeness can still run only until the start of 2020 but that is still three years fewer than EDF would like and it may have to request a second increase in the safety limit. Prof Paul Mummery, from Manchester University, agreed that the original limits were \"conservative.\" But he said the twin problems of graphite cracking and weight loss meant it may be \"uneconomic\" for EDF to keep all the 14 AGR reactors running in the long term because the regulator may insist on more inspections to demonstrate safety. \"They [EDF] are making good progress but I would not be able to say with absolute confidence that they will reach 2023,\" he said.

{"article": "There is a 19km (12 mile), two-lane dual carriage motorway that links Ghana's capital Accra to the port city of Tema. This road also happens to be the one I need to take to get me out of Accra on the way to my village. When the motorway was opened in 1965 and for years afterwards, it was the pride and joy of the nation. Back in 2008, a survey showed that an average of 65,200 vehicles travelled on the road each day and I am certain this number has since doubled. Last month, a part of the road collapsed and it has been total chaos. It is fair to say that this did not come to anybody as a surprise - everybody saw it coming, there have been complaints on the radio, but there was no money to make proper repairs or undertake regular maintenance, or so we were told. Emergency works, which we are told will take 21 days to complete, are in progress. I am sure it will cost more than the money we did not have to do the regular repairs. There is a suspension bridge over the Volta River at Adomi which links the eastern part of Ghana to the rest of the country. I also need to use this bridge to get me to my village. The bridge was built in 1956 and when I was young I used to find it awe-inspiring. It has an arch that spans about 805 feet (245 metres) and rises to about 219 feet at its crown. Back in 2008, the bridge had to be closed for several hours every day over a six-month period for emergency repair works to be done. It was said at the time that no repairs had been done on the bridge since it was built. In 2011, there was an announcement that the bridge would be closed for a year for major repairs. Nothing happened. Last April, a similar announcement was made and the scheduled closure dates went by without any word. The bridge was closed last month and it will stay closed for two years for major repairs. I have no idea of the cost but I have no doubt we are paying emergency rates. And this attitude can be seen elsewhere, too. If you see a house being painted anywhere in Ghana, you can safely assume that someone has died and there is a funeral coming up in that house. If you are seen painting your house, people will stop by and ask if you have a funeral. Regular maintenance of structures is not one of our strong points. It is a subject much beloved of newspaper editors and government officials. There are regular editorials and speeches bemoaning this lack of a maintenance culture. We can never find any money to paint or do any regular maintenance but when someone dies we find the money. Indeed, part of the reason Ghanaians keep dead bodies in the morgue for so long before burying them is because we have to paint the house or sometimes build a brand new one to be able to give a befitting send-off to the dearly departed. We prefer the emergency rates. But maybe I should stop moaning about the funerals. After all, a death in every house means every house gets painted. There are many homes in villages around the country where the electricity has been disconnected because there is no money to pay the fees - once there is a death, the bill will be paid, complete with the reconnection fee and all other penalty charges. Once the bridge is about to collapse we shall find the money. We simply prefer the emergency rates.", "abstract": "In our series of letters from African journalists, Ghanaian writer Elizabeth Ohene, a former government minister and member of the opposition, laments the lack of a maintenance culture in Ghana.", "candidate": "In our series of letters from African journalists, Ghanaian writer Elizabeth Ohene considers the state of Ghana's roads.", "doc_id": 1930, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "A writer talks about and considers the state of Ghana's roads.", "evidence": "Last month, a part of the road collapsed and it has been total chaos.", "explanation": "Nothing mentioned about journalists, writers, or Elizabeth Ohene at all.", "instruction": "Remove the information about the Ghanian writer Elizabeth Ohene from the summary.

{"article": "The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said the area used to farm the poppy plant, the source of opium, increased by 10% to 201,000 hectares. But better farming conditions resulted in a higher yield per hectare, increasing overall production. Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of the substance, which is the main ingredient in heroin. Growing opium is a crime in the country, but it is still a major cash crop for impoverished farming communities. The Taliban also taxes poppy production in areas it controls, which is a major source of income for its military activities. UNODC Executive Director Yury Fedotov said the figures were \"a worrying reversal in efforts\". The opium produced from the poppy plant is used to make some of the most powerful medicinal painkillers, such as morphine. However, many nations cultivate their own supply for medicinal use, and Afghanistan's production of illicit opium is primarily sued for the illegal drug trade. The Afghan government has a stated policy of eradicating poppy crops, but the crop is widespread in many government-controlled regions, and officials are often accused of turning a blind eye. Earlier this year, the BBC's South Asia correspondent Justin Rowlatt visited poppy farms in the north-east, where one farmer told him the local government knew about his crop, but \"they also know it is the only way anyone can make decent money.\" Just 355 hectares (877 acres) of poppies were eradicated by provincial authorities in the last year - down more than 90% since 2015, when almost 4,000 hectares were cleared. Seven insurgents and one officer died during attacks on eradication teams this year. Seven more people were injured. The southern region of the country is the most productive area, accounting for 54% of the entire national opium production. Helmand province, which has seen a resurgent Taliban presence, is the single largest producer, with more than 80,000 hectares of poppy cultivation. The region was a contested area between the Taliban and Nato-led forces, before the latter withdrew in 2014.

{"article": "The two children were allegedly snatched off a Beirut street earlier this month at their mother's behest. The operation was being filmed by four Australian journalists with Channel 9's 60 Minutes programme. The mother, Sally Faulkner, was soon arrested, as were the journalists, two British men and two Lebanese men. The children were returned to their father's custody. The judge overseeing the case has warned that he views the \"child recovery\" operation as a criminal case. Ms Faulkner had said she had not seen the young children since her estranged husband, Ali Elamine, took them from Australia to Beirut on holiday. She flew to Lebanon earlier this month with two employees of the UK-based company Child Abduction Recovery International (CARI) to recover them, accompanied by the 60 Minutes team. CCTV footage broadcast by Lebanese TV appears to show the six-year-old and four-year-old being bundled into a car by several men on a busy street in southern Beirut. They had been heading to school with a domestic worker and their paternal grandmother, who said she was knocked to the ground during the abduction. It was previously reported that the judge was pushing for Ms Faulkner to reach a custody agreement with Mr Elamine. But Mr Elamine has now said he will not drop abduction charges against Ms Faulkner because it could see the others involved released as well. Judge Rami Abdullah said on Monday that the so-called \"recovery\" operation amounted to a kidnapping attempt. \"This is not a custody case, they are involved in kidnapping two kids,\" he said, according to News Corp Australia. The case has been adjourned until Wednesday to allow both sides to negotiate. Those arrested face kidnapping, assault and association charges, which can carry a sentence of up to 10 years in jail. According to reports, Judge Abdullah interviewed 60 Minutes' prominent reporter Tara Brown and Ms Faulkner briefly on Monday before the handcuffed pair were escorted out a side exit to waiting police cars. Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has been in contact with her Lebanese counterpart. \"The law in Lebanon is quite different to Australian law,\" she said in an interview with Network Ten. \"It's based on a French system, so there have been arrests, then an investigation and then an investigating judge determines whether charges will be laid and I understand we're at that stage of the proceedings,\" Ms Bishop said.

Tudur Owen, prosecuting for the RSPCA, said the cat had also bitten and scratched other members of staff. Colleagues had penned the cat under a fridge using chopping boards.

{"article": "Washington blamed Russia and the Syrian government for intensifying their attacks against civilians. Last week, the US warned it would halt the talks unless Moscow stops bombing the city of Aleppo. Russia said it regretted the US move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, Syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on Monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of Aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern Aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john Kirby said: \"The United States is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with Russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. \"Unfortunately, Russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure Syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which Moscow agreed. \"Rather, Russia and the Syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,\" Mr Kirby said, admitting that \"this is not a decision that was taken lightly\". He said Moscow and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's troops had been \"targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 September attack on a humanitarian aid convoy\". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or Syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike.

She also said that the US had failed to divide jihadist groups in Syria from the moderate opposition. Russia and the US were due to convene in Geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but American officials were told to return home.

Analysts were expecting the same figure for January to March. India is the third-largest economy in Asia but has been struggling with inflation and currency weakness. Since July last year, the Indian rupee has seen one of the biggest declines among Asian currencies, dropping more than 27% against the US dollar. \"Shocking numbers as growth was even lower than lows witnessed during the financial crisis,\" said Anubhuti Sahay from Standard Chartered Bank in Mumbai.

{"article": "Prof Jacquie McGlade said the UK was shifting away from clean energy as the rest of the world rushed towards it. She said the cuts in renewables subsidies, coupled with tax breaks for oil and gas, sent a worrying signal to the coming UN climate summit in Paris. The UK government says it will meet its targets on carbon emissions in the most cost-effective way. A spokesman said it was \"absolutely committed to getting a global deal in Paris\". Prof McGlade said the UK appeared to have abandoned its leadership on climate change, while 150 other nations were making unprecedented pledges to shift towards clean energy. She told BBC News: \"What I'm seeing worldwide is a move very much towards investment in renewable energy. To counterbalance that you see the withdrawal of subsidies and tax breaks for fossil fuels. \"What's disappointing is when we see countries such as the United Kingdom that have really been in the lead in terms of getting their renewable energy up and going - we see subsidies being withdrawn and the fossil fuel industry being enhanced.\" Prof McGlade said this was the wrong message to other nations in the run-up to the Paris climate summit next month - and to its preparatory meeting in Bonn this week. \"It's a very serious signal - a very perverse signal that we do not want to create.\" It is unusual for a senior UN official to criticise the policies of a leading member state in such forthright terms. The UK government has promised to reset its energy policies shortly, to explain how it will meet carbon targets while offering fewer subsidies to renewables, following a \u00c2\u00a31.5bn overspend on the notional budget for clean energy. Ministers say they have to force energy bills down. They want new solar and wind projects to be built without subsidy, although the industry says that is impossible at the moment. Since the announcements of subsidy cuts in the summer, three solar firms have collapsed, more than 1,000 jobs have been lost in the clean energy industry and energy investors have started to drain away from the UK. One potential international investor, Paddy Padmanathan, CEO of Saudi-based ACWA Power, told the BBC: \"It's been very badly managed because yesterday we had subsidies - today, I'm sorry, nothing. \"That's basically what has happened in the United Kingdom. You [should] phase out the subsidies - work with the industry in a much more measured way.\" He said investors would turn away from investing in UK infrastructure as a result. \"They will withdraw, they are withdrawing,\" he said. \"Everyone is running around the world looking for other places.

Even the UK companies are looking aggressively elsewhere.\" A Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesperson said: \"We are absolutely committed to getting a global deal in Paris, which will create a level playing field for businesses, driving innovation and growing the low carbon economy.\" The spokesman said subsidies had driven down the cost of renewable energy, leading more people than expected to install technology like solar panels. \"Ensuring subsidies are used where they are needed most, so they can compete with other technologies provides the best value for money for hardworking bill payers,\" the spokesman added.", "abstract": "Cuts in support for renewable energy in the UK have been criticised by the UN's chief environment scientist.", "candidate": "The UK's policy on climate change is \"perverse\" and \"disappointing\", the UN's climate chief has said.", "doc_id": 1975, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "The UK's policy on climate change is \"perverse\" and \"disappointing\", a senior UN official has said.", "evidence": "It is unusual for a senior UN official to criticise the policies of a leading member state in such forthright terms.", "explanation": "The summary says the quote is is from the UN's climate chief but the source text identifies the person only as a senior UN official.", "instruction": "Replace the information about the UN's climate chief with the information about a senior UN official.", "instruction_list": ["Replace the information about the UN's climate chief with the information about a senior UN official."]}}

The manifesto also promises to tackle equality in pay and give more support for childcare and paternity leave. Labour's Harriet Harman said the document was showing women the party was \"on their side\". Ms Harman launched the manifesto accompanied by shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, and shadow minister for women and equalities Gloria De Piero at the Stockwell Gardens Nursery in south London. The trio arrived in the party's woman-to-woman pink mini-bus. Ms Harman described Labour's new policy on grandparents as \"incredibly important\". She said: \"For so long until quite recently politics was just a bit of a men-only game so we need to highlight the fact that politicians are there for women and democracy is there for women as well as men. \"I think we are showing women that we are on their side and will stand up for them in government. \"But I think that what we are saying about grandparents and recognising how many families depend on grandparents to help with children while the parents are working, but also that those grandparents are not retired they are working now, they are working longer. \"And therefore this new policy on grandparents I think is going to be incredibly important.\" Labour leader Ed Miliband told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour earlier that this was the first time a party had looked at grandparents, and said they were a \"crucial part\" to help over \"summer holidays or when a child is sick\". When asked about whether he was assuming that older women could afford to work for free, Mr Miliband said that this was \"about going with the grain of people's lives\" and that the modern workplace needed to reflect \"the reality of family life\". Currently parents can claim 18 weeks unpaid parental leave, or four weeks in any given year, per child up to their 18th birthday. Labour's new idea, which would be consulted on should Labour win power on 7 May, would be to allow grandparents to share in the 18 weeks of unpaid parental leave, but again no more than four weeks in any one year.

{"article": "The latest stage of the government's auto-enrolment programme has seen a 95% compliance rate among small businesses. All employers will eventually need to offer pensions to anyone who is over the age of 22 and who earns more than \u00c2\u00a310,000 a year. The introduction is a gradual process with 66% of employees now signed up. The latter stages are widely seen as the most challenging as employees such as nannies, care workers, plumbers and bar staff are enrolled into a pension. This means employers who only have one or two staff may need to add a pensions policy to their pay and conditions. This group represents more than a third of those who will be required to comply with the rules from now. Employees have the option to opt out of saving. The auto-enrolment system was started in 2012, and aimed to ensure that workers save to enable them to top-up their state pension on retirement. This has reversed falls in workplace pension saving. The full roll-out is taking years to complete, but MPs and regulators have welcomed a successful take-up by workers and compliance by employers - both of whom pay into the pension pot. \"The compliance rates achieved have been consistently at the top of our expectations and the savings landscape has been transformed. But we know the job is not yet done and there are still significant challenges ahead,\" said Charles Counsell, executive director for automatic enrolment at the Pensions Regulator. Those challenges include a question over whether enough is being put into these pension pots. There is concern that some workers may feel that the pensions box has been ticked, only later to find that their pension does not offer them the standard of living they are expecting. New figures from the Pensions Regulator show that the average contribution from employers is 3% a year of an employee's salary. Steve Webb, now director of policy at Royal London insurance company, was pensions minister when the system was created. He said such contribution rates were \"woefully inadequate to provide a decent retirement\". \"The fact that the average employer contribution rate among firms so far is just 3% shows the mountain that we have to climb,\" he said. \"Getting the combined rate of contributions from employers and employees to realistic levels as quickly as possible should be the central focus of the 2017 review of automatic enrolment. Without this, millions of workers in generations to come will simply be unable to afford to retire.\" Minimum contribution rates will increase from 2% to 5% in April 2018, and from 5% to 8% in April 2019. A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions, said: \"We want to make it as easy as possible for businesses to manage automatic enrolment which is why we made the decision to gradually increase the amount employers contribute to workplace pensions. We also know that people will need to save more and we will be considering how to get people to do this as part of our 2017 review.\" Concerns also remain about certain trusts that administer these pensions for small firms, as revealed by a BBC investigation.", "abstract": "More than six million workers have now been signed up automatically to a pension savings scheme but fears remain over how much is being set aside.", "candidate": "More than five million workers in the UK have now been automatically enrolled into a workplace pension.", "doc_id": 1979, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "The UK auto-enrolment programme for a workplace pension now has 66% of employees signed up.", "evidence": "The introduction is a gradual process with 66% of employees now signed up.", "explanation": "The summary indicates that more than five million workers have been enrolled into the program but the source text does not indicate a number of people.

{"article": "In a strongly worded letter to all teachers, Gavin Boyd also said they got better pay than their counterparts in England and Wales. Teaching unions are refusing to co-operate with school inspections in a dispute over pay and workload. Some are also taking occasional strike action. The National Association of Schoolmasters and Women Teachers (NASUWT) has reacted angrily to Mr Boyd's letter, accusing him of \"fake news\". Mr Boyd is chief executive of the Education Authority and represents the teaching employers in negotiations over the current pay dispute. He wrote that the industrial action was \"seriously affecting the education of children and young people\" and \"the effective operation of schools\". He also said teachers had been \"confused by misinformation\" on a number of issues. \"The average teacher's pay in Northern Ireland is just over \u00c2\u00a340,000 per annum,\" he added. \"This compares very favourably with other graduate professions locally and is actually higher than the average teacher's pay in England and Wales.\" He said that teaching unions had rejected an overall offer of 2.5% on pay in 2015-16. \"There have been no reductions in teacher's pay,\" he said. Mr Boyd conceded that national insurance and pension contributions had risen, but said these were \"part of a wider government strategy to ensure public sector pensions remain affordable and sustainable\". \"Public sector pensions remain attractive and in general offer much better terms than those available in the private sector.\" However, the NASUWT's general secretary Chris Keates said his letter would infuriate teachers. \"Teachers will not be persuaded or intimidated by the fake news presented in the letter,\" she said. \"The value of teachers' pay has fallen by around 20% since 2010. \"The employers should start to devote more of their time to addressing the genuine concerns of teachers rather than peddling misinformation.\" The letter will not help to resolve disputes between teachers and their employers, said Heather Watson, the principal of Phoenix Integrated Primary School in Cookstown, County Tyrone. She was \"shocked, confused and disappointed\" when she received the letter. \"It hasn't done anything to reassure teachers that they are respected and valued,\" said Ms Watson. \"I understand that there are two sides to this, but I really want the two sides to get their act together and address the issues.\" Jim Clarke, the chief executive of the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, which represents teachers' employers, said the information in the letter was \"factually accurate\". \"It might not necessarily agree with everyone's perspective but all we can do is present the facts as they are,\" he added. In a related development, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation (INTO) has accused the Department of Education of \"attempts at bullying\" by writing to a Catholic archbishop about the ongoing industrial action. In a letter to members, INTO said that the Department of Education's permanent secretary Derek Baker had written to Archbishop Eamon Martin. They said Mr Baker had requested that Archbishop Martin ensures that school governors co-operate with school inspections. \"Attempts at bullying, such as this, should be rejected as an unsubtle attempt to bring the action to an end,\" they wrote. However, in a statement to the BBC, the department responded by describing the claim as \"utter nonsense\". \"The letter focuses exclusively on the statutory duty placed on governors in respect of safeguarding and promoting the welfare of pupils and seeks their cooperation with the ETI specifically in respect of child protection and safeguarding,\" they said. \"The suggestion that the department's letter amounts to bullying is utter nonsense\".", "abstract": "Northern Ireland's top education official has accused teachers of harming children's education by taking industrial action.", "candidate": "The head of Northern Ireland's Education Authority has said there have been no reductions in teachers' pay.", "doc_id": 1980, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "He said that teaching unions had rejected an overall offer of 2.5% on pay in 2015-16. \"There have been no reductions in teacher's pay,\" he said.", "explanation": "Mr Boyd, who is the authority here, did say there were not reductions in teachers pay so it's accurate.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}
{"article": "Generations of James Bond fans have cheered 007 as he shoots and sleeps his way through a world of sinister villains and exotic women. The image is hi-tech, violent, romantic and more than a little cynical. It's a world-beating brand, but one today's spymasters are doing their best to keep at arm's length. And so, for the first time, MI6, officially known as the Secret Intelligence Service, is taking on the Bond image on 007's home turf - the silver screen. On Monday, MI6 launches its first ever cinema advert, aimed at attracting different types of candidate. A young woman of ethnically indeterminate background is shown demonstrating people skills and emotional intelligence in a range of everyday situations. This woman, we're told, does not work for MI6. \"But she could,\" the advert concludes. Steely-eyed, white male killers, it seems, need not apply. \"There is a perception out there that we want [Bond actor] Daniel Craig, or Daniel Craig on steroids,\" the SIS' current head of recruitment told the Guardian. \"He would not get into MI6,\" says the recruitment chief, identified only as Sarah. Recruiters have long worried about the pervasiveness of the image first portrayed in the pages of Ian Fleming's novels and then seared into public consciousness via the biggest movie franchise of all time. The aim of the advert is to wean the public off this grotesquely misleading stereotype. According to the accompanying press release, the advert aims \"to attract people who rule themselves out of a career in MI6 based on their misconceptions about the agency.\" It sounds like a long shot, but those behind it seem optimistic. \"The whole point,\" Sarah says, \"is about getting people who would never, ever think of joining.\" \"People tend to deselect themselves,\" adds Mark, head of HR. \"We want to prevent that. We want the service to be representative, but also to draw in the capabilities of the workforce at large.\" It's part of a continuing drive to recruit from the widest, most diverse cross-section of society, with a particular focus on women and ethnic minorities, both still under represented in the service. Another aspect of new effort sees a return of the old \"tap on the shoulder\" method employed for decades, mostly in the cloisters of Oxford and Cambridge universities. But if the method will be the same, the locations will be different. \"Diverse organisations,\" is how Mark puts it, without elaborating. Some say that the agency's elite image may be punctured by the revelation that a 2:2 degree will make you eligible. Mark says work experience in other sectors is sometimes just as important as a good degree. Other recruiting tactics display a little playfully appropriate subterfuge to seek out those with interpersonal skills and the ability to influence people. Unbranded fliers invite you to click on goodwithpeople.uk and take a series of tests. Only those who succeed in the online games find out that they have what it takes for a life in the intelligence services. This correspondent scored well on the \"emotion detector\", but not so well on the \"human polygraph\". And when it came to the \"mind changer,\" I failed a text message exercise designed to persuade a friend to attend a surprise party. I have not been invited to join MI6. The advert will run for a month, in cinemas in London, the West Midlands and north west England, partly reflecting the sort of urban areas recruiters look to but also the fact that MI6 can't afford a nationwide release.

{"article": "It is believed to be the first time teachers would have been given a special legal protection in this way. Education minister Esteban Bullrich's plan would add a 25% higher penalty if an offence was against a teacher. Mr Bullrich said it would make sure the public showed them more \"respect\". If the law is adopted by Argentina's congress it would mean any attack against a teacher would become an aggravated offence with increased penalties. It would apply to parents and students and would include verbal abuse or threats as well as physical violence. An offender attacking a teacher would receive a 25% longer prison sentence or pay a 25% bigger fine than if a similar offence had been committed against anyone else. The plan, developed by the education minister and Argentina's president, Mauricio Macri, is a way of supporting their government's \"education revolution\". \"We knew we needed to raise the image of teachers in our society. Slowly, but steadily, their image had fallen,\" Mr Bullrich told the BBC. \"There were increased cases of disrespect from parents and students and even aggression towards teachers. \"That's when the idea of distinguishing teachers in our penal code came up. If you hit or shout at a teacher, then you are doing so towards the most important member in our society. \"Without teachers we would not have ministers or presidents, we would not have the world today. Let us grant them that respect and distinguished treatment.\" More stories from the BBC's Global education series looking at education from an international perspective and how to get in touch . John Bangs of Education International, an international federation of teachers' unions, supported the signal sent by the idea of tougher penalties for assaults on teachers. \"'Schools are fundamental to their communities. If teachers are in fear, it means that children are in fear. Nothing could be more corrosive to confidence and learning. \"Argentina's action might appear to be a simplistic response to complex problem, but it gives a powerful message that violence against a teacher is not only an individual assault but an assault on education.\" Argentina's education system, which has performed poorly in international tests, has faced waves of industrial unrest, and Mr Bullrich has campaigned to gain the support of teachers for education reform. As minister for education in Argentina's capital, Buenos Aires, he published his personal mobile phone number so that teachers could ring him directly with their problems. The minister said teachers thought no-one in government was listening to them and that was contributing to low morale and disaffection. Mr Bullrich gave out his mobile number for \"questions, comments and complaints\", in a bid to tackle teachers' practical worries such as errors with pay and allowances or problems with school buildings. \"People didn't really know if it was true that I would answer,\" said Mr Bullrich when he launched the scheme. \"This guy rang at 02:00 and really blasted me on the phone - 'You owe me money.' So I called him back at 02.15 and said, 'Hello this is the minister of education.' First there was silence on the line and then we got the information and we solved the problem.\" The number of teachers' strikes fell sharply in Buenos Aires. Now Mr Bullrich is the national education minister and he has continued offering his mobile phone number - and he says that he receives hundreds of phone calls each day. In England, teachers' unions have made repeated warnings about attacks on school staff. The ATL teachers' union recently published a survey claiming four out of 10 teachers had experienced violence in the past year. This included being hit, kicked or having objects thrown at them. There have been international efforts to formally give schools and teachers a protected status during wars and conflicts. It followed concerns that places of education were being attacked, whether accidentally or deliberately, and they did not have the same protection that was accorded to hospitals or medical staff in warzones. A Safe Schools Declaration has been signed by more than 50 countries, committing them to protect schools and their staff.", "abstract": "An attack on a teacher would be punished with higher penalties than an attack on any other citizen under proposals in Argentina to raise the status of teaching.", "candidate": "Parents and students in Argentina could face tougher penalties if they attack a teacher.", "doc_id": 1987, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "Argentina's congress it would mean any attack against a teacher would become an aggravated offence with increased penalties.", "explanation": "It says that any attack against a teacher would become aggravated offense and have increased penalties, which means it is tougher.

Simon Shaw, co-head of Impressionist and modern art worldwide, called it \"a small sale that packed a real punch\". He added: \"Each season Picasso has the remarkable ability to surprise, and tonight was no exception, with the unusual appearance of two Blue Period works, which set new benchmarks - both in oil and on paper.\" La Gommeuse, described as most the important blue period Picasso to come to the market in a generation, was painted in 1901. The portrait is of a nude unnamed woman. Gommeuse, which translates into English as 'gummy' was a sexually charged slang word of the time for cafe-concert singers and their songs. It features a second portrait on the reverse of the canvas, which was hidden for a century until its discovery in 2000 during conservation work. The caricature of Picasso's friend Pere Manach was apparently intended as a gift for the Catalan anarchist who shared the artist's studio flat in the Boulevard de Clichy in Paris. The painting was one of 47 works on offer, with just over three-quarters finding buyers. At least two of the top 10 lots were bought by Asian private collectors, continuing a trend of recent seasons. The $306.7m (\u00a3202m) total comfortably beat the $275m (\u00a3182m) low pre-sale estimate. Sotheby's had tagged the high estimate at about $370m (\u00a3244.5m).

She raised almost \u00c2\u00a380,000 for Brain Tumour Research and posted frank videos about her chemotherapy sessions. Her sister Victoria described Miss Swabey as \"one of life's truly inspiring and incredible human beings.\" Charity spokeswoman Wendy Fulcher added that a \"light had gone out.\" Months after her diagnosis Miss Swabey started a blog, Inside my Head, in which she openly chronicled her treatment. However, the latest blog post was from her sister Victoria, who described the moment doctors revealed the cancer had worsened and that surgeons had removed an \"apple-sized\" mass. \"Anna's call was matter of fact and to the point. Her biopsy results showed that the tumour had now progressed to a Grade 4. In all honesty, and in typical Anna style, she was more bothered about how we all felt than what it meant for her.\" Ms Fulcher described Miss Swabey as \"bright, vivacious, kind, and beautiful.\" She added: \"Anna was one of those to whom others are naturally drawn. \"She had a great sense of fun and a marvellous joie de vivre. \"Anna was just 23 when she was told she had a brain tumour. Understandably devastated and angry, she nevertheless held her head up high and decided she would live her life, however long it might be, to the full.\" In her last blog post on 8 July, Miss Swabey spoke of how unwell chemotherapy had left her, but how she had been lifted by her hen party in York. She said: \"I'm getting pretty fed up of feeling poorly all the time now. But I don't think it was really helped because I had my hen party two weekends ago, which was amazing.\" Ms Fulcher said Miss Swabey was given hope by neurosurgeon Kevin O'Neill, who leads the Brain Tumour Research Centre of Excellence at Imperial College. \"She left her first consultation with him in \"tears of happiness\" not because he had changed her diagnosis but because they would fight \"Trev\", as she dubbed the growth in her brain, together,\" Ms Fulcher said. But after her condition worsened she and Mr Bell were forced to postpone their wedding. Ms Fulcher said brain cancer was particularly cruel because it killed more children and people under 40 than any other form of the disease, but received just 1% of national, research funding. Concluding her blog post Miss Swabey's sister said: \"She [Anna] has faced her illness with positivity, dignity and absolute defiance, and we couldn't be more proud of our beautiful girl and the way she has touched so many people with her amazing attitude to life, love and the whole heap of crap she has had to contend with since the arrival of Trev!! \"We have all taken our cue from Anna throughout her illness and we will continue to do so through the most heart-breaking and difficult time of our lives.\"", "abstract": "A woman who blogged about her battle with terminal brain cancer has died a day before she was due to get married.", "candidate": "A blogger who raised thousands of pounds for charity after being diagnosed with a brain tumour has died.", "doc_id": 1990, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "A blogger who raised thousands of pounds for brain tumour research after being diagnosed with a brain tumour has died.", "evidence": "She raised almost \u00c2\u00a380,000 for Brain Tumour Research and posted frank videos about her chemotherapy sessions.", "explanation": "her money was raised for research and not charity", "instruction": "Replace the information about charity with the information about brain tumour research.", "instruction_list": ["Replace the information about charity with the information about brain tumour research."]}}
{"article": "The 23-year-old crowdfunded her way to Rio to compete in the women's single sculls, but finished 20th in the finals last Saturday. However, six days later Snoop Dogg posted a photo of Ukogu on Instagram, telling his nearly 12 million followers that she had won a silver medal - Nigeria's first at these Games: . We all have to admit that following the Olympics can be confusing, with heats and umpteen rounds before the finals. Ukogu did get through her heats, and made the quarter-finals, but needed to finish in the top three to progress to the semis with a chance of getting a medal. She came fifth in her race so was demoted to the \"C/D\" semis and final. In her \"final D\" race she came second, but her time of 7:44:76 put her 18 places below silver. What may have led Snoop Dogg up the garden path was a tweet last Saturday suggesting she had won silver for Nigeria: . This then got picked up on Monday and was retweeted a bit: . More of such tweets appeared on Friday - though it's not clear if this was before or after Snoop Dogg instagrammed. At the time of writing, his post had nearly 97,000 likes and more than 1,000 comments, some of which pointed out that it was not true - with others saying Ukogu was still impressive and made Nigerians proud. \"We have to celebrate her for the sacrifices and selfless service to the nation,\" posted Olufemisylvester. And there is no denying that Chierika Ukogu has made history. She is the first athlete to represent Nigeria in a rowing event at the Olympics. Known to her friends as \"Coco\", she raised $15,000 (\u00c2\u00a311,400) herself as she said the Nigerian Rowing Federation was not able to give her financial support. She was born in the US to Nigerian parents and became hooked on rowing at senior school. She continued to row at university - she plans to become a doctor. \"I put medical school on hold to dedicate my time to training,\" she said on her GoFundMe page. \"I hope that my athletic endeavours will inspire other Nigerians to take up rowing and experience the same joy I feel every time I'm on the water.\" Her enthusiasm is a soothing balm to what has been a bumpy Rio ride for Nigeria - Africa's most populous nation. The men's football team, playing for bronze later on Saturday, is Nigeria's only realistic medal hope. The footballers only arrived hours before their first match. They had been delayed in the US city of Atlanta because of problems paying for their flight. And Nigeria's Olympic kit only turned up a few days ago, after most athletes had completed their events. For the popular Nigerian actress Genevieve Nnaji, Ukogu's success was all about \"girl power\". Nnaji who also posted her praise on Instagram on Friday, but did not make the mistake about the medal. She said: \"She believed in herself, strangers believed in her.... That's how we change the narrative.

{"article": "Procter made a dogged 137, his highest first-class score, and Alviro Petersen a sparkling 81 in a total of 465, a first-innings lead of 347. It would have been greater had it not been for a fiery and entertaining spell from Tino Best, who took 5-90. Jimmy Adams fell to Jimmy Anderson early in Hampshire's second innings as they closed on 22-1, 325 runs behind. Their quest to avoid an innings defeat will be aided by a surface that remains true, albeit with some turn on offer to the spinners. Indeed, the way Lancashire piled on the runs on a hot day further highlighted the inadequacy of Hampshire's meagre first-innings 109. Procter was at first in the company of Haseeb Hameed, who made a careful 62 before edging the impressive leg-spin of Mason Crane to slip, with Petersen then arriving to make batting look easier than anyone else in the match. While the South African busily accumulated and punished anything loose, Procter, favouring the leg side, registered his second first-class century. It was when Petersen was caught hooking Best that Lancashire began to slide in the face of some thrilling, hostile bowling from the West Indian. Procter was caught pulling, while Liam Livingstone had his stumps uprooted and James Anderson was comprehensively bowled. Faced with such a huge deficit, Hampshire instantly lost Adams, who edged a beauty from Anderson, before Michael Carberry and England hopeful James Vince watchfully ensured there were no further loses. Luke Procter told BBC Radio Lancashire: . \"I'm over the moon. To get a century at Old Trafford was one of my boyhood dreams and it's come true. I didn't really think about it when I was out there. I just kept batting. \"The bowlers did a fantastic job for us in the first innings and then for us to put 450 on the board is fantastic. We just wanted to bat all day. There was no rush with how fast we got our runs. \"Haseeb is really good to bat with. He is calm and that calms you down. Alviro was great too. He puts the pressure back on the bowlers. When they come hard at us he goes back hard at them. \"Ashwell Prince batted at three last year and it's obviously big boots to fill bit I've really enjoyed it. I've had a few starts so it's good to get a century on the board.\" Tino Best told BBC Radio Solent: . \"Mason Crane bowled beautifully. For a 19-year-old leg spinner to have that much control is amazing. England have produced a quality leg spinner. He is really one for the future. \"He kept it tight and it gave me the opportunity to really run in and express myself. That's why Hampshire have brought me. At the end of the day, you only have a short while to play this game and I'm 35 this summer. But I'm fit and strong and I'm always ready to go and to commit myself. \"The sun was warm, the wicket was flat and I thought to myself that this is just like first-class cricket in Barbados. But you still have to run in hard and bowl quick and that's what Hampshire are paying me to do. \"The best wicket for me was getting Steven Croft. He is a good player who can take the game away from you. Alviro Petersen was a prize wicket too. It was a good battle. West Indies versus South Africa. And I'm not going to back down. I knew he was going to play his pulls but I made sure he didn't pull me out of the park because I back myself.

Some critics had warned that paying the Shadow Brokers for access to their hacking tools, even with honest intentions, could be illegal. The Shadow Brokers previously sold access to hacking tools allegedly stolen from the US National Security Agency - but often released the vulnerabilities for free later anyway. One of the tools was used to help spread the WannaCry malware that affected thousands of organisations worldwide, including the UK's NHS. The hacking group currently plans to sell a new batch of security exploits, for a payment via the crypto-currency Zcash, worth about $22,000 (\u00c2\u00a317,000). On Tuesday, two security researchers set up a crowd-funding campaign to buy access to the exploits, so the vulnerabilities could be fixed instead. But the idea divided the cyber-security community. \"There's a 50-50 split on whether it is a good idea and whether it would encourage Shadow Brokers to continue their activities,\" said Matthew Hickey from the cyber-security firm Hacker House, who set up the crowd-funding campaign. Others were more outspoken: \"Individuals and corps funding criminals is insane,\" said security researcher Kevin Beaumont.

{"article": "For just over a year when I was 14 years old, I suffered from anorexia nervosa. Weighing a tiny amount, I bought children's clothing and consumed fewer than 500 calories a day. Anorexia nervosa is far from just a battle of wills to resist eating a chocolate bar. It's a serious mental illness. A possession. As though developing a split personality\u200a-yourself and the anorexia. In fact, that's exactly what happened to me. Prior to the illness, I'd been a happy girl and enjoyed a great relationship with my parents, but that deteriorated when anorexia embedded itself in my head. I developed techniques and deceptive ways to make it look like I'd eaten when I hadn't. I'd dispose of food in literally any way I could. I became sneaky and desperate, and I'd lie constantly, dreading any time away from school because home-time meant food time. 'I've eaten' techniques included sprinkling toaster crumbs on a plate to make it look like I'd had toast. I'd hide any food down sleeves, in pockets, in bras, in my cheeks, anything to avoid swallowing it. I'd mop up milk from my cereal with tissues. For a girl who loathed maths more than she currently hated life, I became highly adept at calorie calculation. For a girl who loathed maths more than she currently hated life, I became highly adept at calorie calculation. And I knew how much EVERYTHING provided me with. My mum was immediately on my tail when I started to get thin. I'd exercise compulsively\u200a\u2014\u200aliterally anything to burn calories. I'd relish any chance to get away from my parents so that I could burn calories exercising. I remember running laps of the playground during Girl Guide hours in the evening because it was the only time I could run and burn calories. My patrol must have thought I was very strange. Now that I was below a healthy weight, my periods had stopped and I was attending weekly appointments at the Youth Hospital seeing a dietician and a psychologist. I was clinically depressed and spent every day being force-fed by my parents while I screamed and cried like a banshee at the threat of being fed two spoonfuls of ice cream. I could see my thighs were bigger in the mirror after eating anything calorific. That delusion to me was as real as the glass itself. The body dysmorphia was terrible. I could see my thighs were bigger in the mirror after eating anything calorific. That delusion to me was as real as the glass itself. I believe that I still suffer from this dysmorphia a little even now, over ten years later and at a much healthier weight. My recovery was largely down to my mum, whose persistence in monitoring my every move eventually forced the voice in my head to say 'I can't win this', and slowly begin to shrink back. I remember that moment vividly as though the anorexia actually admitted defeat and resigned. To this day, I can see a girl in the gym and know that she's struggling. I think it's in the arms. There's one at my gym right now. I see her working her tiny limbs like a demon on the spin bike, only she barely has any real muscle to power herself. The fight to create a more versatile fashion and beauty industry is still one which is continuing relentlessly today. ALL healthy bodies are beautiful in any shape, any size and any form. It's not about banishing sample sizes from the runways, TV and magazines, it's about creating body diversity.

{"article": "Media playback is not supported on this device . Five goals were scored in the first half, with Greg Stewart and Kane Hemmings striking early for Dundee. Ross County captain Andrew Davies headed in from a corner before Rory Loy diverted home Hemmings' shot. Alex Schalk netted on half-time, but Craig Wighton and Stewart with a fine solo goal made the points safe late on. After seven minutes Stewart drove through the heart of the County defence before turning the ball onto his favoured left foot and curling it into the bottom corner. Two minutes later Hemmings took full advantage of slackness in the Staggies defence and knocked home his 23rd goal of the campaign. It was no more than Paul Hartley's side deserved after a whirlwind start. Jim McIntyre's team eventually woke up and reduced the deficit after a succession of corners. Davies ghosted in at the front post and with a glancing header knocked the ball beyond David Mitchell to give the travelling fans hope of retaining their place in the top half of the table. And they should have been back on level terms when Michael Gardyne's cross was met on the volley by Martin Woods but the midfielder hammered the ball over the crossbar. Dundee however restored their two-goal advantage as once again the visitors defence was breached. Hemmings had a shot on goal that was glanced into the top corner by Loy giving Gary Woods no chance in the County goal. The first-half action though was far from over. Schalk latched onto a long through-ball and although Dens keeper Mitchell got his hand to the shot there was enough . The second half failed to live up to the opening period but there were still plenty of chances created at both ends. Gardyne blasted high over the crossbar from 12 yards out while Ian McShane saved on the line from Dundee top scorer Hemmings as the home side looked for goal number four. County survived a scare when Hemmings managed to get a touch on the end of a Stewart free-kick but the ball trickled only a few inches the wrong side of the post. The home side secured all three points with four minutes left when Wighton hammered the ball home after Stewart's shot was blocked. Stewart completed the scoring when he once again fired home with a cultured left-foot shot that beat Woods.

He reportedly told him the story was poorly timed. Mr Oliver is alleged, by the Daily Telegraph, to have told the editor, Tony Gallagher, that Mrs Miller was \"looking at Leveson at the moment\". Twenty-four hours earlier, Mrs Miller's special adviser Joanna Hindley called the reporter working on the story to \"flag up\" the culture secretary's role in drawing up new press regulation rules, following Lord Justice Leveson's inquiry into media ethics. A No 10 spokesman defended Mr Oliver's intervention and rejected suggestions he - or Mrs Miller's adviser - were seeking to influence the paper against pursuing the story. They said Mr Oliver was simply raising \"concerns\" with the newspaper about the way the story was being pursued and the fact Mrs Miller's \"elderly father had been door-stepped\" by a reporter. The spokesman added: \"The secretary of state had some concerns about the way that investigation was being conducted and Craig Oliver was simply reflecting those concerns.\" Labour MP John Mann has written to John Lyon, Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, after it emerged Mrs Miller had allowed her parents to live at a property on which she claimed \u00c2\u00a390,718 in second home allowances during the last parliament.

Her parents, John and June Lewis, have apparently been living at the property since selling their home in Wales in 1996.

So I am just going to kind of flag up that connection for you to think about.\" Brian Cathcart, executive director of Hacked Off, which is campaigning for the setting up of an independent press regulator via a change in the law, said: \"This story illustrates exactly why ministers must be kept at arm's length from the regulation of the press. \"It cannot be right that politicians who are subject to the scrutiny of the newspapers and who are constantly vulnerable to public challenge in this way are sitting down with editors and proprietors of those same newspapers to design a press regulation system.\" A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesman said: \"Mrs Miller's special adviser raised concerns with a journalist about the nature of an approach to Mrs Miller's elderly father.

{"article": "This country's dramatic political changes have passed them by. Greater democracy has not brought greater respect for the stateless Rohingya's human rights. But the formation of an Advisory Commission on Rakhine State represents a rare glimmer of hope. For the first time, the Burmese government is seeking international expertise to try and solve one of the country's most complex problems. It's a significant shift. For years, the official Burmese mantra has been that \"no foreigner can possibly understand Rakhine's problems\". Now Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general, has been tasked with taking a fresh look at the issues as head of nine-member commission. His report could just add to the mountain of papers written about Rakhine and the Rohingya, or it just might be a game-changer. Will anyone help the Rohingya? Rohingya migrant crisis in 90 seconds . The 'abandoned' people in Myanmar's election . Aung San Suu Kyi where are you? So what's Aung San Suu Kyi up to? Well, first a cynical take. Next week the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is due in the Burmese capital Nay Pyi Taw and in September Ms Suu Kyi will head to the United States for the UN General Assembly and talks with President Obama. The Nobel laureate was no doubt bracing herself for awkward questions about why she wasn't doing more to help Myanmar's Muslim minority and in particular the 800,000 or so Rohingya. Those questions can now be easily deflected with reference to this new commission. But there's more at play than that. By setting up the commission, Ms Suu Kyi is signalling that she is open to new ideas, and doesn't have all the answers. Kofi Annan may be 78 but, as you'd expect from a former UN secretary general, he's his own man. The final report, due to be delivered by the end of August 2017, is likely to contain suggestions that many Burmese consider unpalatable. Almost certainly it will insist that the Rohingya's basic human rights are respected, perhaps recommending that Myanmar offer them a better route to citizenship. In Myanmar's current political climate it's hard for Ms Suu Kyi to bring those ideas to the table. She'd be attacked not just by hardline Buddhists but many within her own party. So Kofi Annan and his report could be the \"Trojan Horse\" that brings this sort of proposal into the national debate. There are of course plenty of caveats. Problems as deeply entrenched as those between the Buddhist and Muslim communities in Rakhine State will not be solved overnight. The animosity between them has built up over decades with many in the Buddhist majority seeing the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from across the border in Bangladesh. After the violence of 2012, more than 100,000 Rohingya were forced from their homes into camps. In the years that have followed there's been no real effort to help them return. Rakhine has become increasingly segregated, with some comparing it to South Africa's apartheid. Things have become quieter but there's been little reconciliation. Whatever the commission ends up concluding, any move to give the Rohingya greater rights will be hugely controversial not just in Rakhine State but across the country. Vocal parts of the Buddhist community are openly hostile towards international aid agencies and the UN. They're unlikely to welcome Kofi Annan's team, no doubt anticipating the sort of recommendations he might make. Implementing any \"solution\" will be even harder. But the formation of this advisory commission is something new. However small, it's the first bit of positive news that the Rohingya have had for a long time.", "abstract": "There haven't been many good moments for Myanmar's Rohingya Muslims in the last four years.", "candidate": "For years Myanmar's Rohingya Muslim minority have been the butt of international jokes about being second-class citizens.", "doc_id": 2022, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "For decades Myanmar's Rohingya Muslim minority have been seen as illegal immigrants.", "evidence": "The animosity between them has built up over decades with many in the Buddhist majority seeing the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from across the border in Bangladesh.", "explanation": "The summary indicates the feelings toward Rohingya has been for years and the source text says it is decades.

{"article": "Ministers are to publish draft laws they say are a \"landmark\" in prohibiting the substances' production, distribution, sale and supply. Legal highs, officially called new psychoactive substances, have been linked to a number of deaths. Ministers said young people who took them were \"taking exceptional risks with their health\". A blanket ban on legal highs, which are often sold online or on the high street, was in the Conservative Party's election manifesto and featured in the Queen's Speech. Labour also promised to ban their sale and distribution in its manifesto. The Psychoactive Substances Bill applied to \"any substance intended for human consumption that is capable of producing a psychoactive effect\", the government said. Alcohol, tobacco and caffeine will be excluded, and there are also exemptions for food and medical products, while controlled drugs will continue to be regulated by existing laws. The new restrictions will also extend to the sale of nitrous oxide - also known as laughing gas or \"hippy crack\" - for human use. What are legal highs? The government said the \"legitimate sale\" of nitrous oxide, which is also used for food processing, medicinal and industrial purposes, would not be affected. Home Office minister Mike Penning said the measures would \"fundamentally change the way we tackle new psychoactive substances\". They would end the \"game of cat and mouse\" whereby new drugs appeared on the market more quickly than the government could identify and ban them, he said. He added: \"The blanket ban will give police and other law enforcement agencies greater powers to tackle the reckless trade in psychoactive substances, instead of having to take a substance-by-substance approach.\" Legal highs are not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act, although individual substances, such as mephedrone, have been outlawed. The government's proposals would apply throughout the United Kingdom, and would include powers to seize and destroy legal highs and to search people, premises and vehicles. Civil measures - including prohibition notices and prohibition orders - will also be possible.

Peers agreed to go ahead with detailed scrutiny of the new powers contained in the Scotland Bill despite the lack of agreement on the fiscal framework. Tory former Scottish secretary Lord Forsyth had called for the final day's committee stage debate to be delayed until the fiscal framework was published. But he withdrew his demand after opposition from both the government and Labour. Labour's former chancellor, Lord Darling, said it was \"deeply regrettable\" that parliament still did not know what the fiscal framework was going to look like. Lord Darling said there were \"massive considerations\" to take into account in determining tax and welfare. He added: \"I struggle to see how it's going to work. If we don't get it right, we could be simply storing up problems for the future, providing rich and fertile grounds for those who seek out grudge and grievance as a way of life.\" Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney held talks with his UK government counterparts in London on Friday. Mr Swinney said afterwards that progress had been made, but some \"significant issues\" still remained before a final deal could be agreed. The two government have been locked in protracted discussions about how the block grant that Holyrood receives should be adjusted when new tax powers are devolved to Scotland. Any deal must meet the principle of \"no detriment\" - the idea that neither the UK or Scottish governments should lose out financially simply as a result of the decision to devolve.

{"article": "The amnesty would have applied to offences committed during the political turmoil after Thailand's 2006 coup, which ousted Mr Thaksin. The bill's passage in the lower house triggered large street protests. And on Monday, as the bill went to the Senate, tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Bangkok. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra - who is Mr Thaksin's sister - has promised to respect the Senate's decision. The bill, which was proposed by the governing Pheu Thai party, applied to offences committed during the upheaval after Mr Thaksin was removed from office. Ms Yingluck's government had argued that the legislation was a necessary step towards reconciliation, after several years of political turmoil. This turmoil included the occupation of Bangkok's main airport in 2008 and then two months of street protests in Bangkok in 2010 that left about 90 people - mostly civilian protesters - dead. But critics said it would allow human rights abuses - such as the killing of civilian protesters - to go unpunished. The main opposition Democrat Party also believed it was aimed at allowing Mr Thaksin to return to Thailand without having to serve a jail sentence. Mr Thaksin has been in self-imposed exile since his conviction on corruption charges over a property deal. He argues the charges are politically motivated. The lower house backed the bill, despite an opposition boycott. But as protests gathered strength, the governing party withdrew its support from the bill and all 141 senators present voted against it. \"This house rejects this bill for consideration,\" said Deputy Senate Speaker Surachai Lengboonlertchai. As tens of thousands of anti-government protesters remained on the streets in parts of Bangkok on Monday night, a spokesperson for the Pheu Thai party said the governing coalition would not bring the amnesty bill back to parliament. \"We believe from tomorrow the political crisis will start to ease as there are no reasons to maintain the protest,\" said Pormpong Nopparit. But the opposition has urged its supporters to observe a three-day national strike, beginning on Wednesday, in what correspondents say has turned into a campaign to bring down the government.

Kyrgios threatened a comeback in the second set tie-break but two superb lobs helped the Scot to a crucial lead. The sixth seed is through to his fifth Australian Open and 15th Grand Slam semi-final. In the last four he will take on seventh seed Berdych, now working with Murray's former coach Dani Vallverdu who left the Briton's team in November. While Berdych enjoyed a landmark win over Rafael Nadal in his quarter-final, Murray overcame the great new hope of Australian tennis - and a packed and expectant crowd on Rod Laver Arena. \"I didn't go into it obviously thinking like that,\" said Murray about facing the home favourite. \"I was just trying to win against Nick, which was tough because he has an exceptional serve and makes it very difficult for you when he's serving. \"And it was very tricky conditions as well, so I was quite happy with the way I handled everything tonight.\" The dominant force from the outset, particularly on serve, Murray used a variety of spins and angles to keep Kyrgios off balance. When Kyrgios did suggest a fightback, the Briton was able to find a big serve or a winner to halt the momentum. Two terrific lunging returns set up a break point in game six and a sliced backhand drew the error when Kyrgios went for too much. On a cold and breezy evening, the home crowd needed their man to bring a bit of heat to the contest and, after saving an early break point in the second, he worked his way into the match. A tie-break was required and Kyrgios looked likely to take it when he turned around a 2-0 deficit to lead 4-3 with a break, but Murray played a magical forehand lob to wrestle back the initiative. The Australian had a half-chance facing a second serve at 5-5 but could not make the return, and Murray produced another winning lob off the backhand to clinch the set. A furious Kyrgios risked a point penalty when he smashed his racquet, having earlier been warned for an audible obscenity, but at least escaped that punishment as he faced the prospect of recovering from two sets down for the second time in three days. Murray further tightened his grip when he made it a hat-trick of unplayable lobs on the way to breaking for 4-2 in the third, only to slip up with the finish line in sight. It took nearly two hours for Kyrgios to earn a break point but he converted his second when a distracted Murray netted a backhand, and the crowd came to life. Murray needed to snuff out the danger quickly and he did just that, thanks in part to a poor line call at 30-0 down which he capitalised on with two thumping cross-court forehand winners. It left the British number one serving for the match, and there were no alarms this time as he sealed it with a smooth forehand winner down the line. \"It was a really good experience,\" said Kyrgios, who was aiming to become the first Australian man to reach a Grand Slam semi-final since Lleyton Hewitt in 2005. \"That was my first Aussie Open Grand Slam match playing on Rod Laver, so that was really cool. But he was way too good for me tonight. \"I thought he served really well. A lot of variety.

{"article": "The good stuff is silicon-28, and physicists in the US have worked out how to produce it with 40 times greater purity than ever before. Even better, they can do it in the lab instead of relying on samples made ten years ago in a huge, repurposed plutonium plant in St Petersburg. This promises to solve a serious supply problem in quantum computing research. Several of the most promising schemes for building a quantum computer are based in silicon. One that has received much attention stores \"qubits\" in atoms of another element, like phosphorous, embedded in a tiny layer of ultra-pure silicon-28. Qubits are the quantum replacement for bits - the ones and zeros that represent information inside a conventional computer. They promise to usher in a new era of computing because they can simultaneously encode a one and a zero, enabling incredibly fast and complex calculations. The difficulty for silicon-based designs is that normal silicon contains quite a lot of atoms that aren't silicon-28. Almost 8% of a commercial silicon wafer is made up of other isotopes like silicon-29, which would cause interference in a quantum chip. \"It leads to decoherence, which is sort of like ADD in computers,\" explained Dr Joshua Pomeroy, one of the physicists behind the new work, from the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Maryland. Researchers in this field, like Dr Pomeroy, have been relying on off-cuts of enriched silicon-28 that all started out in Russia. The St Petersburg facility is a repurposed plutonium enrichment plant, housing industrial-scale gas centrifuges which were commissioned in 2004, by German scientists, to produce a sample of silicon-28 with 99.99% purity. That sample was used to crystallise 5kg of the stuff, at a cost of around one million euros, for an international effort to calculate Avogadro's number from 1kg, perfect spheres of silicon-28. Waste material from this project has been almost the only global source of this high-quality silicon ever since. Dr Pomeroy explained that the quantum community \"can't command the resources\" to commission that type of production. \"It's fortuitous that the Avogadro project existed,\" he told the BBC. \"So there's sort of a nervousness - when they wrap up finally, and they're not buying any more of it, what are we going to do?\" But Dr Pomeroy and his colleagues have now shown that small amounts of silicon-28, enriched to an unprecedented 99.9998%, can be produced using equipment already found in many labs. They managed the feat with kit that is normally used for mass spectrometry - a technique for identifying a substance based on the weight of the different atoms it contains. By pumping ions of silicon through a big magnetic field, the different isotopes (atoms of silicon with different weights) can be separated from each other, because heavier atoms are diverted less by the magnet than lighter ones. Dr Pomeroy said this was an unexpectedly simple solution. \"We had what often happens in science, which is that we had an apparatus whose purpose had come to an end. And we had a problem that needed solving, and we married them up.\" The thin films of silicon-28 that his team can produce are very, very pure - but also very small. \"It's much more difficult to produce large quantities,\" Dr Pomeroy concedes, \"but particularly in the research phase, those quantities are largely unnecessary.\" Despite some controversial commercial initiatives, quantum computers primarily remain a field of research. And according to Dr Pomeroy, the new approach is more than capable of delivering enough of the purer-than-pure silicon for scientists to test out their designs. Importantly, researchers around the world could potentially make it in their own labs. \"We're recognising that we don't need to produce an entire wafer's worth of silicon-28 that's enriched,\" he said. \"We only really need to make enough to insulate the computer from the rest of the wafer.\" The team's research was published in the Journal of Physics D.

Meanwhile, a senior RAF commander says IS has been firing surface-to-air missiles at coalition planes. But so far no aircraft has been hit. Lieutenant General Mark Carleton-Smith said the military had assumed IS possessed missiles capable of bringing down an aircraft but had not been targeted by them until recently. Missiles fired at coalition aircraft have been detected as they were launched, enabling the targeted planes to take defensive action using flares, which cause the missiles to explode before they hit. The Iraqi government and Kurdish Peshmerga forces intend to launch an offensive on IS in Mosul in the coming weeks.

By Jonathan Beale, BBC defence correspondent . Over the past two years British warplanes have carried out more than a thousand airstrikes, in which they have dropped more than 2,000 bombs and missiles on what they say are IS targets in both Syria and Iraq. They are not the only ones who've been looking for targets. For the first time, the RAF has confirmed its aircraft have been fired at too - with IS anti-aircraft fire and shoulder-launched surface to air missiles - though they say they've always dealt with the threat. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said the focus of the air campaign was now turning towards Mosul, the last major city in Iraq still under IS control. He said the offensive to liberate the city would begin within weeks but he admitted that pushing IS out of Syria would be much harder. He added that the air force, which is targeting more than 100 locations in and around the city, was now operating \"at the highest tempo in a single theatre for over 25 years\".

Disabled former senator and Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole, who uses a wheelchair, appeared on the floor of the Senate in support. The treaty was signed by 155 nations and ratified by 126, including Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. It says all nations should work to ensure that disabled people enjoy the same rights and freedoms as other citizens. The treaty was backed by Mr Dole, who was disabled in World War II, Arizona Senator John McCain, who sustained disabling injuries in the Vietnam War, Indiana Senator Richard Lugar, the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, and former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh. However, only eight Republican senators voted in favour of the treaty. Others, like Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe, said they voted against the measure because of the extra regulation it would bring with it. \"I do not support the cumbersome regulations and potentially overzealous international organisations with anti-American biases that infringe upon American society,\" Mr Inhofe said. The White House said it was \"disappointed\" that the \"overwhelming majority\" of Senate Republicans voted against the treaty. Ratification of the treaty \"would position the United States to support extending across the globe the rights that Americans already enjoy at home.

{"article": "The weaker value of the pound since the Brexit referendum vote means that the UK is now a much cheaper destination than it used to be. Many mainland Europeans, Americans and Chinese people are taking advantage of that. That's clear from the cacophony of different languages and accents outside Buckingham Palace, and on the streets around the Palace of Westminster. \"It's a little more economical than it was a few years ago,\" says one visiting American tourist. \"Thanks to the euro, London is not more expensive than in France,\" a French tourist adds. Meanwhile, a German man said the euro-pound rate has \"made me quite happy\". Two-thirds of the international visitors enjoying London's sites, Cornwall's beaches and Edinburgh's Royal Mile are from the rest of the European Union. The tourism agency VisitBritain forecasts there'll be a 6% rise in the number of international visitors in 2017, with large numbers coming from France in particular. VisitBritain's director Patricia Yates says: \"The currency is in our favour. It might motivate more people to come.\" The tourism boom was helped by the Olympics in 2012, a showcase for Britain's historic towns, picturesque villages, and stunning national parks. The latest data from Forward Keys, which monitors flight bookings, suggests international arrivals to the UK will be 9% higher for August to October this year compared to the same period of 2016. Bookings from China are up 20%, and those from the US are 23% higher, the data suggest. There aren't just more tourists, they're also spending more when they're in the UK. VisitBritain predicts tourists' spending will surge by 14% this year. \"Very often people budget in their own currency. They're getting more pounds for their money, and we can see their spend going up,\" says Patricia Yates. Sterling has tumbled 16% against the euro since the June 2016 referendum, and has fallen 23% against the US dollar. Over the past two years, the pound has dropped about 30% against the euro. \"There are some factors putting downward pressure on the pound, and some other things putting upward pressure on the euro,\" says Paul Hollingsworth of Capital Economics. He lists the downward forces on sterling as \"Brexit and uncertainty about the UK's future relationship with the EU, the economy... and the expectation for interest rates\". \"We've seen quite a Brexit bounce,\" says Jace Tyrrell from the New West End Company, which represents shops on London's Bond, Oxford and Regent Streets. As shoppers carrying bags from all sort of stores rush by on Regent Street, Mr Tyrrell says, \"In the past six months, there's been a 36% increase in spend here, so certainly international visitors are appreciating the value depreciation\". Stores report sales of pricey jewellery and high fashion items have been rising the most. The large American hotel chain, Hilton, has 138 hotels in the UK, and is planning to open 30 more, partly because of the tourism boost spurred by the fall in sterling. The company says it has seen double-digit growth in the UK over the past year. In the lobby of one of its swanky London hotels, Simon Vincent, Hilton's president of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, says we're living through a \"golden age of travel\". Another factor behind the company's British expansion is demand from UK customers, as \"staycation\" becomes more popular. \"The domestic customer has always been an important part of our business mix, particularly in our portfolio outside of London,\" says Mr Vincent. \"In fact, it's the most significant proportion of our business. It's been growing well.\" Despite \"Brexit bounce\", the sharp increase in tourist numbers began before the sharp drop in the pound, and the industry says it isn't relying on currency depreciation to increase numbers further. \"We operate in a competitive global environment,\" says VisitBritain's Patricia Yates. \"We will never be a cheap destination, we don't want to be.

Activists reported clashes in Khalidiya on Monday morning, but said that most of the area was under army control. The announcement comes a month after troops launched an offensive to oust rebels from Syria's third largest city. Homs has been one of the focuses of a two-year nationwide uprising against President Bashar al-Assad, in which the UN says more than 100,000 people have died. Correspondents say the capture of Khalidiya would add further impetus to the counter-offensive by government troops and their allies, which saw the nearby town of Qusair fall in June. By Paul WoodBBC News, Beirut . The fall of Khalidiya had been expected. One Western diplomat said he had been told recently by a Free Syrian Army commander that it was not possible to get any ammunition or other supplies in. Cut off from help, it was only a matter of time, perhaps, for the rebels. There are other parts of Homs still, just, in rebel hands. But if they, along with Khalidiya, do fall, Homs will become just the latest in a line of regime victories on the battlefield. The regime's forces have been steadily picking off some of the villages around Homs. Two months ago, with the help of Hezbollah, they recaptured the town of Qusair. The government has halted - if not quite turned around - a rebel advance on Damascus. Sources close to the regime say an offensive is also planned for the northern city of Aleppo. After Khalidiya, Syria conflict goes on . In pictures: Khalidiya devastation . On Monday, an unnamed army officer told Syrian state television: \"Today, we can report having complete control of the area of Khalidiya.\" \"That was a victory of all our fighters and the whole Syrian Army and especially our dear leader, Bashar al-Assad. And God willing, we will get rid of the terrorists in the entire country and the future will be free of killings and under the control of the army.\" However, UK-based activist group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights cast doubt on the claim. While the group acknowledged that government forces were in control of most of Khalidiya, it said fighting was continuing on Monday. \"Clashes took place between rebels and regime forces, supported by Hezbollah and National Defence Forces, in the southern parts of the Khalidiya neighbourhood,\" it said. \"Regime forces are bombarding parts, and military reinforcements are arriving as advancing regime forces try to establish full control.\" Opposition activists told the AFP news agency that about 90% of Khalidiya was now controlled by the army. One told the Associated Press that the battle for the district was \"almost over\". On Sunday, the Arabic TV station al-Mayadeen, which is seen as close to the Syrian government, broadcast what it said was footage of Khalidiya, showing heavily damaged buildings and piles of rubble. It also showed pictures of the interior of the historic Khaled bin Walid mosque, a focal point for anti-government protesters. Troops reportedly seized it on Saturday, days after activists accused them of firing shells at the tomb of Khaled bin Walid, a revered figure in Islam.

{"article": "Some fans and politicians were angry that poppies were not worn by players. In a statement, Ulster Rugby said several other Pro12 clubs had not worn a poppy during games at the weekend. It said its players had observed a minute's silence and it would hold a memorial service on Tuesday. The Belfast Telegraph reported that some fans had described the absence as \"shameful\". Robert McCartney, a former soldier who runs the Beyond the Battlefield charity, told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme it was \"an insult\". \"I honestly believe they did cause an insult yesterday,\" he said. \"It is a mark of respect, the reason they are able to play the sport themselves is because of the freedom these men gave them and if they can't put the poppy on their shirt for one day and show that respect, then they really did disgrace themselves yesterday. \"We lost an awful lot of people in the wars and probably members of their family as well and for them not to wear it was a complete insult to the country.\" Doug Beattie, an Ulster Unionist councillor and former army captain, said he believed remembrance was a \"personal thing\". \"The Ulster Rugby team had a remembrance service on that day, they had a minute's silence before the match and everybody is complaining about the symbolism of wearing a poppy, well I just don't get it,\" he added. \"I don't like the word poppy fascism or poppy Stalinism, there are people who are passionate about the poppy and remembrance and me and Robert have got more in common than we don't, but on this issue I feel that people should wear the poppy if they want to wear the poppy if they don't then they should not. \"I would rather stand beside somebody who is wearing it for a reason than somebody who is wearing it because somebody has told them if you don't you are unpatriotic.\" The Ulster Rugby statement said \"players and supporters respectfully observed a minute's silence prior to the fixture against Newport Gwent Dragons on Sunday\". \"Kingspan Stadium has a permanent War Memorial Arch, which pays respect to those fallen during WW1 and WW2,\" it added. \"Each year, Ulster Rugby pays respect in its usual and traditional manner with a memorial service at the arch, during which a wreath is laid by the Ulster Rugby President.\" The statement added that Newport Gwent Dragons and Cardiff Blues were the only Pro12 clubs who wore a poppy on their sleeves at the weekend.", "abstract": "Ulster Rugby has responded to criticism after poppies were absent from players' jerseys during their Pro12 game against Newport Gwent Dragons on Remembrance Sunday.", "candidate": "Ulster Rugby has defended its decision not to wear a poppy during Sunday's game against Newport Gwent Dragons at Kingspan Stadium.", "doc_id": 2062, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "\"It is a mark of respect, the reason they are able to play the sport themselves is because of the freedom these men gave them and if they can't put the poppy on their shirt for one day and show that respect, then they really did disgrace themselves yesterday. \"", "explanation": "A bit all over the place, but the defense came to Ulster by saying that the men are free to make choices not to wear a poppy, and the game itself was to be played against Newport Gwenty Dragon's which is also in the source, in Kingspan Stadium, which was where the match was being played.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}
{"article": "But, if the venerable founding father had lived in Northern Ireland over the last few months he could have changed it to \"death, taxes and another RHI story every day\". The News Letter continues firing journalistic wood pellets on the ever-burning fire. Its political editor Sam McBride reports on two leaked documents that reveal the names of two civil servants who told figures in the renewable heat industry in July 2015 the scheme was soon to end. The paper has received business emails appearing to indicate that information was circulating about the scheme's imminent end. It's been claimed that a spike in RHI applications in the two months before the scheme's October 2015 closure was due to details of its ending being widely known. However, the News Letter points out that the department have not confirmed or commented on the latest revelation, and adds that there is no suggestion that the civil servants named acted improperly. Sam McBride also sets out, across eight lengthy bullet points, the newspaper's justification for publishing the names of the civil servants and stresses that it is \"not alleging corruption\". Watch this space. Elsewhere on Planet RHI, the Irish News reports that a charity watchdog is investigating after a green energy group said it would be \"ethically improper\" to warn Stormont about flaws in the scheme. The managing director of Action Renewables, a group paid to process RHI applications, made the comments to the Irish News last week. Now the Charities Commissions says it has \"opened a concern\" on Action Renewables. Meanwhile, the Irish News' front page is dedicated to the naming of a soldier who shot dead a man in Belfast 45 years ago, a move welcomed by the man's widow. Mary Thornton, speaking outside court on Wednesday, said: \"The way I look at it is, he shot him, so why not?\" She added that the inquest had helped her family answer questions about the death of an \"ordinary father who lived for myself and the children\". Elsewhere, Thursday's papers firmly put Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the firing line after he wrongly told Westminster that a PSNI officer shot on Sunday had died. \"Apologise!\" says the News Letter's front page, reflecting a call by Police Federation chairman Mark Lindsay who called it a \"jaw-dropping gaffe\". It's understood Mr Corbyn has written to the PSNI's chief constable to say sorry, but the Belfast Telegraph says it's only the latest in a line of \"blunders from the Labour leader\". If the Labour leader is feeling sheepish today, spare a thought for the chap caught taking a naked jog over Londonderry's Craigavon Bridge. The Daily Mirror reports that the man pleaded guilty at Derry Magistrates' Court on Wednesday after his Tuesday night run was caught on CCTV. A defence lawyer said he had \"given no reason for the jogging naked across the Craigavon Bridge, but he is not in the habit of doing this type of thing\". The man received a conditional discharge for a year. January is nearly at a close so that means it's nearly February - aka Six Nations mania time. After beating New Zealand last November, and confirming their rightful place as rugby's greatest team, Ireland are seen as the dark horses. So the mind games have started, reports the Daily Mirror. Joe Schmidt's side take on Scotland in the opening fixture on Saturday week, and Scotland coach Vern Cotter says Ireland and England will win the title. The paper reports that Schmidt is having none of it: \"I'm sure VC said that. A little more expectation on my shoulders and a little off his shoulders maybe. He has got bigger shoulders than me.\" And finally from shoulders to Leo Santa Cruz, Carl Frampton's opponent for this weekend's highly anticipated WBA World Featherweight Championship rematch. Santa Cruz lost to Frampton last summer but, the Belfast Telegraph reports, he's more focused this time after his father's all-clear from cancer. \"Frampton is going to face the real Leo Santa Cruz this time.

No arrests have been made but police have set up roadblocks and are searching for the suspects. Scrutiny of sexual violence in India has grown since the rape and murder of a student on a Delhi bus in December. The gang rape of the student sparked widespread protests and prompted the government to alter laws relating to rape in India. Five men and one juvenile have been charged with the rape. One of the men has since hanged himself in prison, officials say. In the Manali case, police say the three men drove the woman to a secluded spot where they raped her and robbed her. After arriving in Manali on Monday she had been on a visit to Vashisth, a nearby tourist area popular with foreigners, but was delayed and had been looking for a taxi in the early hours of Tuesday morning. \"Because it happened at night, she couldn't read the truck number. At around 7am, we put up checkpoints everywhere and we've been looking for the suspects,\" senior local police official Vinod Dhawan told BBC Hindi. \"We have found some clues at the crime scene.\" A case of rape was filed after the woman had been medically examined in a local hospital, police say. The US embassy in Delhi said it was aware of the case. \"We are in contact with authorities but due to issues of privacy we have no further comment,\" a spokesperson told the BBC.

Mr Hadi and his government have since offered their resignations, saying they could not continue in their posts under such pressure from the rebels. Their decision came after the Houthis seized the presidential palace complex and shelled the president's private home. In a televised speech following the release of Mr Hadi's chief of staff, rebel leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi dismissed the president's resignation as a \"manoeuvre\". He said Yemeni political parties, with UN support, had been holding consultations. \"We are seeking a peaceful transfer of power on the basis of partnership,\" he was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying. The resolutions of the National Dialogue Conference (NDC), held after an uprising forced longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh from power, and the peace deal signed by Mr Hadi after the rebels overran Sanaa in September, would be the basis for any agreement, he added. \"Let everyone go towards co-operation instead of clashing, arguing and wrestling.\" A week ago, Mr Houthi accused the president and those around him of failing to implement political deals which he said should have ushered in a new era in Yemen. He listed as his main demand the shake-up of the commission tasked with writing a review of a new constitution to ensure more representation for his group. The rebels have rejected a draft of the charter that would create a federal state of six regions, even though the plan was a recommendation of the NDC, which they backed.

{"article": "MPs on the Public Accounts Committee accused them of making corporate taxable income \"vanish into thin air\". But the tax chiefs, including from PwC and KPMG, said many common assumptions about avoidance schemes were wrong. Jane McCormick, KPMG's tax head, said there was \"no appetite among clients\" to do anything outside the law. The committee was taking evidence from the Big Four accountancy firms, which also includes Deloitte and Ernst & Young, at a time when issues of tax avoidance have moved centre stage. Revelations about the tax arrangements of companies including Google, Amazon and Starbucks - which use the Big Four - have sparked a debate about tax avoidance. Last week, Prime Minister David Cameron said countries had to work together to clamp down on aggressive avoidance schemes. The tax heads defended the use of tax havens, arguing that it was wrong to say that companies just routed money through \"doors with a brass nameplate\". If a company is registered in a tax haven, it has to have staff and facilities there, said Kevin Nicholson, PwC's head of tax. \"If there was no substance there, the advice would not work,\" he said. The panel of experts also rejected suggestions that by advising companies to avoid tax, they were breaching the spirit of the Companies Act, which requires directors to act in good faith and maintain high standards. Asked by PAC chairwoman Margaret Hodge about the legality of some avoidance advice, the tax heads accepted that 10 or more years ago, the advice may have sailed closed to the wind. However, John Dixon, tax head at Ernst & Young, said: \"The advice we give is based on substance and fact. I think that the world you refer to is gone.\" The four experts were also questioned on their relationship with government. All the Big Four provide technical advice to Whitehall on the drafting of tax legislation. The MPs accused the firms of then advising corporate clients on how to avoid this legislation. Ms Hodge said the firms should be barred from getting government contracts in order to avoid a conflict of interest. But PwC's Mr Nicolson said: \"The role we play makes the tax system work.\" As the committee hearing came to a close, the tax experts also took exception to Ms Hodge's parting shot. She praised their abilities, intelligence and expertise, adding: \"You could give so much more to the public good, but you choose to work in areas that reduce resources\" for schools, hospitals and society.

{"article": "It also defied predictions that it would not survive the collapse of its one-time supporter, the Soviet Union. Since the fall of the US-backed dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in 1959, Cuba has been a one-party state led by Mr Castro and - since February 2008 - by his chosen successor and younger brother, Raul. Fidel Castro exercised control over virtually all aspects of Cuban life through the Communist Party and its affiliated mass organisations, the government bureaucracy and the state security apparatus. Exploiting the Cold War, Fidel Castro was for decades able to rely on strong Soviet backing, including annual subsidies worth $4-5 billion, and succeed in building reputable health and education systems. But, at least partly because of the US trade sanctions, he failed to diversify the economy. The US and Cuba agreed in 2014 to normalise relations. Population 11.2 million . Area 110,860 sq km (42,803 sq miles) Major language Spanish . Major religion Christianity . Life expectancy 77 years (men), 81 years (women) Currency Cuban peso . Raul Castro, the world's longest-serving defence minister, took over as president in February 2008, succeeding his ailing brother Fidel, who had been in power for five decades. After being re-elected by the single-party National Assembly in February 2013, Raul announced his intention to stand down at the end of his second term in 2018. Fidel Castro brought revolution to Cuba in the 1950s and created the western hemisphere's first Communist state. His beard, long speeches, cigar, army fatigues and defiance of the United States earned him iconic status across the globe. Raul, 76 at the time of this appointment, has been his brother's trusted right-hand man and was once known as an iron-fisted ideologue who executed Fidel Castro's orders - and enemies - ruthlessly. Under his leadership, Cuba's Revolutionary Armed Forces became one of the most formidable fighting forces in the Third World with combat experience in Africa, where they defeated South Africa's army in Angola in 1987. The Cuban media are tightly controlled by the government and journalists must operate within the confines of laws against anti-government propaganda and the insulting of officials which carry penalties of up to three years in prison. Reporters without Borders in early 2016 described Cuba as \"one of the world's worst countries from the viewpoint of journalists\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 independent journalists and bloggers are constantly persecuted by the Castro government\". Some key dates in Cuba's history: . 1898 - Cuba is ceded to the US which defeated Spain in war. 1902 - Cuba becomes independent under the protection of the US. 1933 - Sergeant Fulgencio Batista seizes power in a coup. 1959 - Fidel Castro leads a guerrilla army into Havana, forcing Batista to flee. 1961 - US breaks off diplomatic relations in response to the nationalization of US-owned properties, and later imposes a complete commercial embargo. 1961 - Cuban exiles backed by the US try to invade Cuba at the Bay of Pigs, but are defeated. 1962 - The US and the Soviet Union have a showdown that almost touches off war after the US discovers Soviet nuclear missiles on Cuba. The confrontation ends with the Soviets removing the missiles and the US agreeing never to invade Cuba. 1975 - Castro sends troops to Angola to help fight rebels backed by South Africa. It is the start of 15 years of war in which 300,000 Cubans will fight. 1991 - The Soviet Union, Cuba's biggest benefactor, collapses, touching off an economic crisis. 2006 - Fidel Castro provisionally turns over power to brother Raul Castro, who becomes president in 2008. 2014 - US President Barack Obama and President Castro announce moves to normalise diplomatic relations, severed for more than 50 years.", "abstract": "Cuba's Communist government has survived more than 50 years of US sanctions intended to topple veteran leader Fidel Castro.", "candidate": "Cuba's 1959 revolution, led by Fidel Castro, was one of the defining images of the 20th Century.", "doc_id": 2081, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Cuba's 1959 revolution, led by Fidel Castro, and since 2008 led by his brother, Raul.", "evidence": "Since the fall of the US-backed dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in 1959, Cuba has been a one-party state led by Mr Castro and - since February 2008 - by his chosen successor and younger brother, Raul.", "explanation": "No mention the revolution being the most defining thing of the 20th century, but it did mention his brother was now in charge since 2008.", "instruction": "Remove the information about the revolution being one of the defining images of the 20th century from the summary.

{"article": "Sion Davies, 25, died after falling off a balcony at Anthony Munkley's Caia Park estate flat in Wrexham last October. Footage of the attack was filmed on Mr Davies's phone and played to the jury at Mold Crown Court. Lee Roberts, 33, and 53-year-old Mr Munkley deny murder. His wife, Gwenythe Munkley, 55, denies helping her husband evade arrest. Mr Munkley admitted having a drug problem since the age of 12 and said he was \"addicted\", but denied owing Mr Davies money. He said he had been dealing cannabis since February of last year, and his flat came to be known as \"The Shop\", making around \u00a3400 from about 30 customers a week. Mr Munkley said he had \"absolutely nothing\" to do with the murder, blaming it on \"a Geordie man\". He said he left the flat while that man fought Mr Davies. He told the jury the man was bringing Mr Davies a \u00a320 bag of cannabis. He said that man wanted to buy a crossbow, and he got one from his bedroom and showed it to him before agreeing a price of \u00a360. Mr Munkley said he went to the bedroom to get the box for it, and when he returned he heard the twang of the crossbow and saw Mr Davies punch the man in the face. \"I decided to get out of there,\" he said. \"I just panicked. I did not want my wife coming home to that. I got my dogs and I ran.\" The court previously heard the victim was stabbed, shot with a crossbow and pushed, or fell, from three storeys up.

In the past few days, the Syrian army backed by Russian air power has made a series of gains in Aleppo province. The advance threatens to encircle the city of Aleppo, Syria's largest, landing a major blow to the rebels. Nato has accused Russia of \"undermining\" Syrian peace efforts through its strikes, which it says are mainly aimed at opposition groups. But Russia insists it only targets what it calls terrorists. On Friday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused Russia of being engaged in an \"invasion\" of Syria, saying it was trying to create a \"boutique state\" for President Bashar al-Assad, an ally of the Kremlin. Mr Erdogan said Russia and the Syrian government were together responsible for 400,000 deaths in Syria. Turkey and Russia have been embroiled in a row since Turkey shot down a Russian jet it accused of violating its airspace in November. According to the UN, up to 20,000 Syrians have gathered at the Bab al-Salam border crossing. \"Humanitarian organisations are responding to the needs of those displaced, but ongoing military conflict is making access to populations in need increasingly difficult,\" the UN's Linda Tom told the AFP news agency. She said another 5,000-10,000 displaced people had gathered at Azaz, a north-western Syrian city close to the Turkish frontier.

February 2012: As the rebellion turns into a conflict, clashes between rebels and the government are reported with increasing frequency in Aleppo province . July 2012: The battle for Aleppo begins. Rebels make swift advances, but are unable to consolidate their gains and the city becomes divided . 2013: The government begins bombarding rebel districts with barrel bombs, causing thousands of casualties . September 2015: Syria launches a fresh offensive in the wake of Russia's intervention in the conflict . February 2016: The government captures towns north of Aleppo, threatening to encircle the city . Aleppo profile . Separately, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said 15,000 people had arrived at the border. In a televised speech, he said Turkey would not leave them \"without food or shelter\" but would not say if they would be allowed in. Friday saw further gains for the Syrian government on the ground, recapturing the town of Ratyan, north of Aleppo. Earlier in the week, it claimed a major victory by breaking the rebel siege of two towns in Aleppo province, severing an opposition supply line from Turkey to Aleppo city. \"It feels like a siege of Aleppo is about to begin,\" said a spokesman for aid group Mercy Corps, David Evans, who said the main humanitarian route was cut off. Since 2012, Aleppo has been divided into rebel and government-held areas. Before the conflict it was a key commercial centre and home to over two million people. Why is there a war in Syria? Anti-government protests developed into a civil war that, four years on, has ground to a stalemate, with the Assad government, the so-called Islamic State group, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all holding territory. Who is fighting whom? Government forces concentrated in Damascus and the centre and west of Syria are fighting the jihadists of Islamic State and al-Nusra Front, as well as less numerous so-called \"moderate\" rebel groups, which are strongest in the north and east. These groups are also battling each other. More than 250,000 Syrians have been killed and a million injured. Some 11 million others have been forced from their homes, of whom four million have fled abroad - including growing numbers who are making the dangerous journey to Europe. How has the world reacted? Iran, Russia and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement are propping up the Alawite-led Assad government, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar back the more moderate Sunni-dominated opposition, along with the US, UK and France.

Mr Maxwell was remanded in custody after a three-minute hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court. He will appear again in court on Monday, 5 September. He is charged with manufacturing explosives, making devices and storing them in barrels in hides in England and Northern Ireland. Ciar\u00e1n Maxwell appeared in Westminster Magistrates' Court flanked in the dock between two plain-clothed police officers. Wearing a grey sweatshirt, a stubble-type beard and short hair, he stood before the judge and confirmed his name, age and address in Devon. The hearing lasted just three minutes. The judge remanded him in custody until he is due back in court on Monday. The charges include obtaining articles for use in terrorism - specifically chemicals and components to make bombs - and having an image of an adapted police pass card. The charges come as part of long-running investigation involving the Security Service (MI5), the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the South West Counter-Terrorism Unit, as well as Scotland Yard's Counter-Terrorism Unit, says BBC Home Affairs Correspondent Danny Shaw, who was at the court.

{"article": "The Queensferry Crossing was scheduled to be completed by December this year but that deadline will not be met. Keith Brown, the cabinet secretary for the economy, said the delay had been caused by \"adverse weather conditions\" in April and May. In a statement to MSPs he said the delay was a \"very recent development\" caused by high winds earlier this year. Mr Brown said the contractor, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors (FCBC), had advised Transport Scotland that it was unable to achieve a target opening date of December 2016. In response to a question from Mid Scotland and Fife MSP Murdo Fraser, the minister said the bad weather \"exceeded expectations\" and resulted in an increase in the number of days lost to the weather. He told MSPs that 25 days were lost over April and May due to high winds, using up the time contractors had put aside for contingencies. Work was also halted in April when a 60-year-old worker was killed on the site. Mr Brown said contractors remain on schedule to complete the project ahead of the contractual completion date - six months after the December target. He also insisted that there would be no financial impact or cost to the taxpayer due to the opening date being pushed back, but did admit that \"weather is still a factor\" in the May 2017 target. The Scottish Conservatives said ministers must now give a date for completion. Murdo Fraser said: \"This is very disappointing news for people on both sides of the bridge. \"They were continually told by the Scottish government that this project was ahead of schedule and would soon be up and running. \"Now we find this is not the case, so the SNP must now give an exact date when this will be completed by.\" The existing Forth Road Bridge was closed to traffic for almost three weeks in December after a crack was discovered under a truss in the roadway. Mr Fraser called for assurances that the current bridge is fit to carry on while the new crossing is completed. \"We saw the sheer disruption caused to people and businesses when the existing Forth Road Bridge was closed over Christmas,\" he said. \"It's essential we know whether or not the patch-and-mend approach taken at that point will be enough to ensure it can cope until the Queensferry Crossing opens.\" Mr Brown insisted that the existing Forth Road Bridge could handle an extra six months of heavy traffic. Labour's Alex Rowley said the delay \"will be greeted with great disappointment in Fife and beyond\". Stressing that the building of the new bridge remains good news, he said it was \"important that ministers do not announce unrealistic deadlines\", calling for \"full transparency\" in the project. Lib Dem MSP Alex Cole-Hamiltion, whose Edinburgh Western ward includes the southern end of the bridge, said the project was in \"abject distress\". He queried \"how on earth\" 25 days of delays had caused the opening date to be pushed back 180 days. Mr Brown said \"everything possible\" was being done to get the bridge open as quickly as possible, in line with safety guidelines. In February, Transport Scotland said the project was scheduled to finish \"on time and under budget\".

{"article": "Scientists found that even the lowest expected levels of warming could decimate populations. However the researchers found that restoring connections between butterfly habitats could help modify the worst impacts. The research has been published in the journal Nature Climate Change. Although many people believe that butterflies are creatures that love the warmth, periods of extremely hot and dry weather can significantly reduce populations. In this study, British researchers looked at the impact of an extreme drought event in 1995 on butterfly species. This was the most arid summer since records began in 1776. They identified six species, including the Cabbage White and the Speckled Wood butterflies, that were particularly sensitive to heat. They then looked at what might happen to these creatures under different levels of warming up to 2100. If emissions of carbon dioxide continue on a \"business as usual\" model, and warming is more extreme, then extinctions of some of these species could begin in England as early as 2050. \"We looked at the extent to which populations crashed from the drought and how long it takes them to recover,\" said lead author Dr Tom Oliver from Nerc Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. \"What we're asking is, as droughts become more frequent whether the return time of the drought was more frequent than the recovery of the butterflies.\" \"And when that was the case you'd get this gradual population erosion and in those places you'd get local extinctions.\" The researchers say that areas of the south east of England would be worst affected. However they argue that under less extreme warming conditions, changes to butterfly habitats could ameliorate the worst impacts. The team found that restoring connections between habitats that have been fragmented by human activities such as agriculture, was capable of making a big difference. Under a low emissions scenario, bridging these connections could improve the probability of butterfly survival by 50%. \"If our habitats are very fragmented, the impacts will be much more severe. In places where it isn't those populations might persist,\" said Dr Oliver. \"It allows us to buy time until we get those global emission cuts in place.\" The researchers believe their study is a conservative estimation of how warming might impact these fragile species. They are concerned that, because of landscape changes in the UK throughout the 20th century, populations of some of the threatened species might be too low for them to recover from frequent droughts. The authors say that even people who are not impressed by the aesthetic appeal of butterflies should still be concerned about their demise. \"Butterflies are important culturally as part of our natural heritage, but there are other functions that could be impacted by their extinction including pollution, pest control and decomposition of waste,\" said Dr Oliver. \"Those un-swayed by the beauty and importance of having butterflies in the countryside ought to be concerned about the disruption to these functions provided by these species.\" Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.", "abstract": "Global warming could drive drought sensitive butterfly species to extinction in the UK by 2050, according to new research.", "candidate": "Climate change could lead to the extinction of some butterfly species in the UK, according to a new study.", "doc_id": 2107, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "If emissions of carbon dioxide continue on a \"business as usual\" model, and warming is more extreme, then extinctions of some of these species could begin in England as early as 2050.", "explanation": "The problem being caused by climate change can be clearly and directly inferred.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

Curator Dave Young said there was a lot of affection for him in the town. Many of the pieces on display at The Old Low Light Heritage Centre in North Shields have never been seen in public before. Mr Young, said: \"We hope that this exhibition will shed new light on the life and work of a remarkable man and also a much misunderstood artist. \"This is the first major exhibition of his paintings to be held in his hometown of North Shields since the artist's lifetime and it is being held in a building that he would have known well and often painted. \"Victor Noble Rainbird's paintings are a fascinating legacy of life in the North East before and after the Great War, while his own remarkable war record is only now being unravelled.\" Mr Rainbird joined the Northumberland Fusiliers in 1914 when he was 26-years-old and served on the Western Front at Ypres, Passchendaele, Vimy Ridge and Armentieres. Some of the drawings he produced while on active service have survived and are included in the exhibition. Mr Young said they were a \"poignant, important and sombre record of the horrors of war\". After the war, Rainbird made several return trips to France, Belgium and the Netherlands, producing some of his most impressive works. He died aged 47 in 1936.

{"article": "A spokesman said under new proposals, no-one younger than 18 or older than 75 would be allowed to climb. The ministry of tourism could also insist that all climbers have previous mountaineering experience. Nepal makes millions of dollars every year from the Everest industry but has been criticised for poor management. In 2014, the mountain was closed after 16 Sherpas (guides) died in an accident. And earlier this year, the climbing season was called off after a massive earthquake triggered an avalanche that killed 18 climbers. Over the past decade many people have sought to establish world records on the world's highest mountain, a practice the government wants to discourage. The youngest person to climb Mount Everest was 13 and the oldest 80. \"We don't think we should issue permits to people who cannot see or walk or who don't have arms,\" tourism department chief Govinda Karki told AFP news agency. \"Climbing Everest is not a joke... it is not a matter of discrimination. How can you climb without legs? Someone will have to carry you up. We want to make the mountains safer for everyone, so we have to insist on some rules.\" Mr Karki also said the government was considering only issuing permits to climbers who have already scaled another mountain above 6,500m (21,300ft). Over the years, Everest has attracted many climbers aiming to overcome their disabilities. Last week, Japanese mountaineer Nobukazu Kuriki, who had previously lost nine fingers to frostbite, abandoned his attempt to climb the mountain. In 2006, New Zealander Mark Inglis, who had lost both legs to frostbite, became the first double amputee to reach the 8,848m (29,029ft) summit.

The alien world could give us more information about the formation of our Solar System. The find was made by the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI), which looks for young planets orbiting bright nearby stars. Our own Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system - it's so big you could fit over 1,300 Earths inside it! It's also the fastest rotating planet too, with 1 day only lasting 10 hours - but a year on Jupiter lasts for 12 Earth years. Jupiter doesn't have a solid surface and is made up of gas, giving it the name 'gas giant'. The baby Jupiter has the strongest methane gas signature ever found on an alien planet. The astronomers also detected water using the GPI's spectrometer instrument. Scientists hope that by studying far away worlds, they can learn more about how common the structure of our Solar System is. Astronomers believe the gas giants in our Solar System formed slowly - by building up a large core over a few million years and then pulling in a huge amount of hydrogen and other gases to form an atmosphere. This is known as a \"cold-start\". But the Jupiter-like planets that have been discovered so far are much hotter than scientists have predicted.

{"article": "The car was bought by Rick Champagne, a logistics company owner from Phoenix, Arizona. The 56-year-old, who was just 10 when the high-camp TV series began in 1966, said it \"was a dream come true\". The Batmobile design was based on a 1955 Lincoln Futura, a concept car built in Italy by the Ford Motor Company. It was the first time that car had come up for public sale since it was bought in 1965 by car-customiser George Barris for a nominal fee of $1. Barris then spent $15,000 (roughly \u00a35,370 at the time) to transform it into the famous superhero vehicle, over a period of 15 days. It had a V-8 engine, arguably one of the first in-car phones, and parachutes, which were deployed to help Batman turn sharp corners. Mr Barris told reporters at the auction: \"The car had to be a star on its own. And it became one.\" Since the show was cancelled in 1968, he has toured the Batmobile and was eventually housed in a private showroom in California. Adam West, now 84, played the caped crusader in 120 episodes in four years of programming, with Burt Ward starring as the \"boy wonder\" Robin and comedian and actor Cesar Romero as Batman's arch nemesis, The Joker. The 60s show was camp in its portrayal of Batman. More recent incarnations of billionaire Bruce Wayne and his alter-ego - such as British director Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy - have had a much darker tone.

Phillips played for the St Louis Rams, Miami Dolphins and San Francisco 49ers until 1999, but he was plagued by trouble on and off the field. After his NFL career, Phillips continued to have problems with the law. Eventually, he was sent to prison after being convicted of assault for driving his car into a group of teenagers. In another case, he was convicted of assaulting a former girlfriend.

Women's activists had led protests demanding entry specifically to the Lord Shani shrine. \"Women entered Shani temple's inner sanctum,\" news agency ANI quoted the 94-year-old as saying on Monday. \"The women are worshipping Shani in the temple. By doing so, Shani's eyes would fall on women and this would result in increase of rape incidents.\" Women were kept out of the Shani Shingnapur temple for nearly 400 years and temple officials, in the past, had claimed that the ban was actually \"to protect women since Shani emits radiation which can harm them and cause deformity in a foetus if a pregnant woman enters the temple\". Last year, temple priests carried out an elaborate ritual cleansing after a woman managed to gain entry inside and offer prayers. The temple authorities relented after last month's Mumbai high court ruling that women had a fundamental right to enter temples, and said those trying to prevent them would be handed a six-month jail term.

Shadow business secretary Clive Lewis has said he will vote against the bill unless Labour's amendments are accepted, describing them as \"red lines\". Ms Thornberry declined to say whether they were non-negotiable red lines for her party, and denied it was \"illogical\" to demand amendments but still back the bill in the final vote if they are rejected. \"There will need to be back channels, private conversations.

Former Labour minister Caroline Flint criticised Ms Abbott, telling ITV's Peston on Sunday: \"We used to have man flu, we now have Brexit flu that Diane has created here\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it's about being part of a team. \"I think she holds one of the most important portfolios within a shadow cabinet. If she can't support the leader on this then she should go.\" But former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman defended Ms Abbott, pointing out she had earlier said on television she would back the bill so had \"already taken the flak on it\". Among the rebels in last week's second reading vote were 10 members of the front bench, who would ordinarily be expected to step down after defying leadership instructions to back the bill. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that changes to his shadow cabinet would be announced \"in the coming few days\". Asked if he should be lenient, he added: \"I'm a very lenient person.\" Speaking later, he said he expected Ms Abbott to vote with the party this week. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the shadow cabinet would decide how to approach Wednesday's third reading vote on the Brexit bill. He told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 live that if a three-line whip was again imposed, any frontbenchers who rebelled \"will have to step down\".", "abstract": "The shadow foreign secretary has suggested Labour will continue to support legislation paving the way for Brexit as it passes through Parliament.", "candidate": "Labour is \"trying to get a compromise that will work\" on the Brexit bill, the shadow foreign secretary has said.", "doc_id": 5, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "We are speaking to government, we are speaking to Tory backbenchers and we are trying to get a compromise that will work.\" One of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's closest allies, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, missed Wednesday's vote, citing illness", "explanation": "Diane is definitely the shadow foreign secretary from the source, also she did make a comment about getting compromise to work and this whole source is about Brexit so it's all fitting.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

{"article": "Matching Models in London describes itself as \"an international temp agency for beautiful and talented people\". It advertised for a personal assistant with \"a classic look, brown long hair with b-c cup\". The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) called it \"appalling, unlawful and demeaning to women\". Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the EHRC, said it would be writing to Matching Models \"asking for them to clarify their hiring practices immediately\". Meanwhile, women's equality campaigners said its ads were \"straight out of the 1970s\". Sam Smethers, chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said: \"It is extraordinary that they are taking this approach and almost certainly falls foul of equality legislation. \"If we ever wonder why the battle for gender equality hasn't been won, this is a timely reminder.\" The agency's founder Nathalie Jansen said: \"Our clients are important to us - and looks are important.\" Another job advert on the agency's website asks a \"sexy female driver\" to drive a Porsche Cayenne two days a week for between \u00a340,000 and \u00a350,000-a-year for a Knightsbridge-based businessman and polo team owner. Employment lawyer James Lynas, partner at Winckworth Sherwood, said the advert was \"clearly unlawful\", adding anyone could complain to the Equality and Human Rights Commission, who have powers to intervene. He said an employment tribunal could find the use of phrases such as \"beautiful and attractive\" were really code for \"young\", and in reality discriminatory against older women. He added: \"A male driver who genuinely wanted the job could submit an application and sue for sex discrimination if rejected. Compensation for such claims is unlimited. \" A statement on the agency's website states: \"It is almost politically incorrect to request someone to work for you that is both attractive as well as professionally equipped with the right set of skills. \"However, our company understands the importance of having the right people representing your company, because after all, first impressions count.\" But Ms Hilsenrath said: \"Matching Models are right about one thing; first impressions count, but the important stuff is not about your hair colour. \"If they wish to maintain their reputation, they should act like a business in the 21st Century and consign this type of sexism to the history books.\" Under the 2010 Equality Act, it is against the law to say, or imply, that you will discriminate against anyone - including saying that you are unable to cater for disabled workers. Employers are also not allowed to question a candidate's age, sexual orientation, marital status, number of children or plans to have children, disability, race or religion. As for specifying clothing sizes, an employer has to be able to show that it is essential to the nature or context of the work. Talking about the personal assistant advert, Ms Jansen said: \"The client who wants the specific cup size is an older gentleman - he has a specific outfit he designed with Christian Dior. He wants a \"Jackie O\" look. And he wants a lady with a smaller cup size to fit into the outfit.\" \"I recently had an Indian businessman who interviewed 60 women from my firm. He wanted a blonde, blue eyed, Greek woman. He hired 6 of them to work on his plane.\" Matching Models clients include MTV, Louis Vuitton, Coca-Cola, the Renualt Formula 1 team and Harrods.

{"article": "Tom Rogic, who levelled in extra time for Celtic, missed the vital spot-kick, blazing high and wide. Rangers striker Kenny Miller fired in the opening goal, with Celtic replying through an Erik Sviatchenko header. A wonderful long-range strike from Barrie McKay had Rangers in front on 96 minutes before Rogic swept home to set up a tense Hampden shootout. James Tavernier and Nicky Clark failed to convert from the spot for Rangers, while Callum McGregor and captain Scott Brown could not hit the target for Celtic before Rogic's miss made it 5-4 on penalties to the Championship winners. Minutes before the penalties, a thunderous free-kick from Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths crashed off the crossbar and bounced off goalkeeper Wes Foderingham before slipping narrowly wide. Foderingham also made a good stop to deny Rogic from close range after the Australian substitute had scored to make it 2-2. A pulsating, engrossing and always combative Old Firm game ended with several players out on their feet, barely able to move. The game had been a relentless affair from the outset. The pitch seemed a clutter of players in the opening spell, as play ranged from one end to the other. Defenders had to rely on their wits and hope that their composure would survive the sense of being under siege. Celtic's back four were certainly soon aware of the nature of the threat they would face, when McKay - who was lively and impressively dangerous throughout - speared a ball through to Miller, whose shot was well stopped by Craig Gordon. Rangers began to impose their game plan, passing the ball swiftly and adroitly and taking the set-pieces short, particularly corners. Yet Celtic could be incisive on the break, and Brown ought to have opened the scoring from the edge of the area, only to tug his shot wide. Amid the breathlessness, Rangers found good fortune on their side. The breakthrough came when Tavernier delivered a poor corner kick that led to the ball breaking to Andy Halliday. His cross in turn was also mis-hit, but the ball cannoned off Brown into the path of Miller, who finished coolly. With Halliday and Jason Holt pushing forward in central midfield, Rangers were composed and assertive. The strategy was effective but Celtic could still rely on individuals to be bold and they should have equalised when Griffiths' shot bounced off the post, with the rebound landing at the feet of Patrick Roberts. With an open goal in front of him, the on-loan winger skewed wide. The miss would have galled Celtic, but so too would the way Rangers often passed the ball around them, even at close-quarters. Kieran Tierney, so solid, dependable and with such sound defensive instincts, was a one-man resistance for the Premiership leaders for a period before half-time. Fiery words would certainly have been spilled inside the Celtic dressing room during the interval. It was effective, since the team was aggressive, intense and irrepressible at the start of the second half. Celtic won four corners in succession and scored with the last of them, when Roberts' delivery was headed high into the net by Sviatchenko. Sviatchenko and Nir Bitton both came close with headers before players tired and became more conservative. No quarter could be given, though, and every aspect of the game was contested. Celtic certainly believed that a throw-in early in extra should have gone their way. Instead, Rangers worked the ball to the edge of the area, where McKay hammered a shot into the top corner. For all that the players were drained and sore, the rivals could not be separated and the excellent Tierney made space to cross and Rogic converted low into the corner. Penalties followed a frantic finish and Halliday, McKay, Nicky Law, Lee Wallace and Gedion Zelalem held their nerve to score and set up the the first final to be contested by two teams outside the top flight.

{"article": "Johnston has been at the club for 15 years, serving as chairman for 10. Recently, he has faced pressure to step down altogether from fans who felt his presence was an impediment to attracting potential club investors. \"It has been an honour to serve Kilmarnock FC in various capacities over the last 15 years,\" Johnston said. Meanwhile, BBC Scotland has learned negotiations are continuing between the club and Lee McCulloch and his representative, as Killie look to make him their permanent manager. McCulloch has been in interim charge at Rugby Park since Lee Clark's departure for Bury in February, and successfully kept Kilmarnock in the Scottish Premiership. Johnston is also standing down from the board of the Kilmarnock Community Sports Trust (KCST) on which he represented the club. In a statement, Kilmarnock said: \"When Michael took over as chairman and majority shareholder the club had around \u00a313m of debt. \"Aided by a number of high value transfer fees which he personally negotiated, Michael gradually reduced this while maintaining the club's competitive position in the top tier of Scottish league football. \"In March 2014 Michael completed a transformational restructuring of the club's finances which delivered the arm's length sale of the Park Hotel for full market value, with the proceeds going towards reducing the club's bank debt of \u00a39m. \"Billy Bowie acquired the balance of the bank debt and converted this into equity in the club, combined with the permanent write-off by former chairman Jamie Moffat of the balance of his loans to the club, which originally totalled \u00a31.8m. \"The outcome was the elimination of almost \u00a311m of debt from the club's balance sheet. \"In the wake of that, Michael introduced a new board of directors and stood down as chairman in 2015. He also formed KCST, a registered charity, to run the club's community department in a more financially efficient manner.\" Troon-born Johnston said the death of his wife Joanne in March hastened his decision to relinquish his positions at the club. \"I have been fortunate to meet so many interesting people through football and greatly enjoyed serving on the council of the Scottish FA for over 10 years and the board of the Scottish Premier League during the historic amalgamation with the Scottish Football League in 2013,\" he said. \"There have been many challenges to confront along the way and these have taken their toll on not only me but also my family, to whom I extend my heartfelt thanks for their unqualified support. \"The recent loss of my wife Joanne, who was my greatest source of inspiration and encouragement at all times, has prompted my decision to retire from all active duties at the club and I look forward to attending Rugby Park as a committed supporter in future, unburdened of the worries of the past. \"I wish Billy Bowie and John Kiltie the very best of luck and good judgement in running the club, ably supported by club secretary Kirsten Callaghan, who was a key member of staff during my time as chairman. \"I also wish to record my thanks to all the members of staff, past and present, the shareholders and the supporters who have supported me and the club so enthusiastically over the years. \"The club is now in a healthy position to advance in Scottish football and register even greater success.\"", "abstract": "Former chairman Michael Johnston has resigned from his positions as a director and the company secretary of Kilmarnock.", "candidate": "Michael Johnston has stepped down as majority shareholder and chairman of Kilmarnock.", "doc_id": 25, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "Johnston is also standing down from the board of the Kilmarnock Community Sports Trust (KCST) on which he represented the club.", "explanation": "Very clear in the summary and source that he is stepping down from the trust, which would mean he's a shareholder because of that.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}
{"article": "Speaking at an annual meeting of central bankers, Janet Yellen was cautiously upbeat about the US economy. She said economic growth and a stronger jobs market meant \"the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months\". There has been a growing expectation that US interest rates will rise this year. Some economists are saying that the next hike could even come next month. The central bank raised interest rates at the end of last year for the first time in nearly a decade, but has held them steady amid concerns over persistently low inflation. Ms Yellen, speaking at a three-day symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, did not comment on when rates would rise. But she said \"the US economy was nearing the Federal Reserve's statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability\". She added: \"In light of the continued solid performance of the labour market and our outlook for economic activity and inflation, I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened in recent months.\" However, Ms Yellen emphasised that future rate increases should be \"gradual\". She noted that inflation is still running below the Fed's 2% target, but said this is being depressed mainly by temporary factors. Subadra Rajappa, head of rates strategy at Societe Generale, in Washington, said: \"We weren't really expecting her to signal a hike at the September meeting, but she's just kept the door open for a hike sooner rather than later. \"I think that the Fed wants to get the market to start pricing in a hike for this year, which they weren't doing earlier, and now I'm seeing the probability of a hike by December has gone up slightly over a coin toss.\" John Canally, economist at Boston-based LPL Financial, added: \"It looks like she is warming a little more to a hike this year, probably not September but probably December.\" Signs of slow improvements in the US economy came in data published on Friday. Although the growth rate of second quarter GDP was revised down slightly, from an annual rate of 1.2% to 1.1%, consumer spending - which makes up more than two-thirds of US economic activity - was revised up from 4.2% to 4.4%. Separately, US Labor Department figures showed that claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 261,000 for the week ended 20 August. It was the third straight weekly decline in claims. On Tuesday, Commerce Department data showed that US new homes sales jumped in July to their fastest rate in nearly nine years.

{"article": "The Mid-Infrared Instrument (Miri) will gather key data as the $9bn (\u00c2\u00a35.5bn) observatory seeks to identify the first starlight in the Universe. The results of testing conducted at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK have just been signed off, clearing Miri to travel to America. James Webb - regarded as the successor to Hubble - is due to launch in 2018. It will carry a 6.5m primary mirror (more than double the width of Hubble's main mirror), and a shield the size of a tennis court to guard its sensitive vision from the heat and strong light of our Sun. The observatory has been tasked with tracking down the very first luminous objects in the cosmos - groupings of the first generation of stars to burst into life. To do so, Webb will use its infrared detectors to look deeper into space than Hubble, and further back in time - to a period more than 13 billion years ago. \"The other instruments on James Webb will do massive surveys of the sky, looking for these very rare objects; they will find the candidates,\" explained Miri's UK principal investigator, Prof Gillian Wright. \"But Miri has a very special role because it will be the instrument that looks at these candidates to determine which of them is a true first light object. Only Miri can give us that confirmation,\" she told BBC News. JWST is a co-operative project between the US (Nasa), European (Esa) and Canadian (CSA) space agencies. Europe is providing two of the telescope's four instruments and the Ariane rocket to put it in orbit. Miri is arguably the most versatile of the four instruments, with a much wider range of detectable wavelengths than its peers (5-28 microns). Fundamentally, it is a camera system that will produce pictures of the cosmos. But it also carries a coronagraph to block the light from bright objects so it can see more easily nearby, dimmer targets - such as planets circling their stars. In addition, there is a spectrograph that will slice light into its component colours so scientists can discern something of the chemistry of far-flung phenomena. Miri is a complex design, and will operate at minus 266C. This frigid state is required for the instrument's detectors to sample the faintest of infrared sources. Everything must be done to ensure the telescope's own heat energy does not swamp the very signal it is pursuing. The hardware for Miri has been developed by institutes and companies from across Europe and America. The job of pulling every item together and assembling the finished system has had its scientific and engineering lead in the UK. Miri has just gone through a rigorous mechanical and thermal test campaign at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in Oxfordshire. This included shaking the instrument to simulate the pounding it will receive during the ascent to orbit on the Ariane. It was also put in a vacuum chamber and subjected to the kind of temperatures it will experience in space. \"It's been a real privilege to work on Miri and great to see it finally ship out,\" said Paul Eccleston, the engineer at RAL who has overseen the test campaign. \"It will be so exciting when we put it on top of the rocket and light the blue touch paper, so to speak, and watch it go up into space.\" The paperwork signing off the test results has now been accepted by Nasa. The next step is for Miri to be put in a special environment-controlled shipping box, so it can travel to the US space agency's Goddard centre. The Maryland facility is where the final integration of James Webb will take place. Miri will be fixed inside a cage-like structure called the Integrated Science Instrument Module and positioned just behind the big mirror. The years to 2018 promise yet more testing. Recommended 16 years ago as the logical evolution beyond Hubble, the JWST has managed to garner a fair amount of controversy. Technical difficulties and project mismanagement mean the observatory is now running years behind schedule and is billions of dollars over-budget. Elements of the US Congress wanted to cancel the telescope last summer. That did not happen, but Capitol Hill now has James Webb on a very short leash, with Nasa required to provide monthly updates on milestones met or missed. Much of the talk around James Webb tends to centre on cost. The current estimate for the US side is $8.8bn, which covers the full life cycle of the project from its inception to the end of initial operations. Extra to that bill is some $650m for the European contributions like Miri and Ariane. Dr Eric Smith is Nasa's deputy programme director for James Webb. He believes taxpayers do appreciate the venture. \"When you're able to show people that James Webb will do things that not even Hubble can do - then they understand it,\" he told BBC News. \"People recognise how iconic Hubble has been, and how much it has affected their lives. \"The images and scientific results that Hubble has returned have permeated popular culture. Webb pictures will be just as sharp but because the telescope will be looking at a different part of the spectrum, it will show us things that are totally new.\"", "abstract": "One of Europe's main contributions to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is built and ready to ship to the US.", "candidate": "One of the four instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has passed its final test.", "doc_id": 35, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "The paperwork signing off the test results has now been accepted by Nasa.", "explanation": "The instruments went through testing and the results of all the instruments were accepted by NASA, so the final test was completed.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

{"article": "The film, written by JK Rowling and starring Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander, took a total of \u00a315.3m. It is the third highest opening weekend from the JK Rowling series, behind the two final Harry Potter films. Warner Bros executive Josh Berger said: \"We are thrilled with the huge response from British and Irish audiences.\" The film also worked its magic at North American cinemas, taking an estimated $75m (\u00a361m) over the weekend - more than the rest of the US box office top 10 combined. Harry Potter creator Rowling has planned scripts for a total of five films in the series. The first instalment is set in New York, and tells the story of a fictional author mentioned in the Potter stories. Redmayne plays the part of the animal-loving magizoologist Newt Scamander, who visits New York's secret community of witches and wizards. The film is set 70 years before Harry Potter reads his book at his school, Hogwarts. It has received broadly positive reviews from critics. The opening weekend haul in the US and Canada was lower than for any of the Harry Potter films, however. Elsewhere in the box office charts, Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange fell to second with $17.7m (\u00a314.3m), with Trolls third on $17.5m (\u00a314.1m). Sci-fi movie Arrival, starring Amy Adams, took fourth spot with $11.8m (\u00a39.5m), while the comedy Almost Christmas, starring Danny Glover and Gabrielle Union, rounded out the top five with $7m (\u00a35.7m).

{"article": "As Ron Jones, from Newport, prepares to mark Holocaust Memorial Day on Friday with a service at the city's cathedral, he says that amongst all the terrible memories, there will also be a few which will make him smile. He was captured in 1943 fighting in the Middle East, and after nine months in Italy, was transferred to forced labour camp E715, part of the Auschwitz complex. There he spent 12 hours a day, six days a week, working with hazardous chemicals in the IG Farben works, but on Sundays they were permitted to play football. \"I think the Germans thought that letting us play football was a quick and easy way of keeping us quiet,\" he said. \"The Red Cross would bring us food parcels, and when they heard about our football, they managed to get us strips for four teams: England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. I was always the Wales goalkeeper. \"It kept us sane, it was a bit of normality, but it sounds wrong somehow to say I've got fond memories of playing football, considering what was going on just over the fence.\" He says as well as keeping up spirits, football played a major role in his survival, and that of many of his fellow prisoners, when they were forced on one of the series of extremely long marches westwards from PoW camps during the final stages of the conflict. Whilst many of Mr Jones's friends died on the march, he believes it is no coincidence that those who had been involved in the Auschwitz football league fared better. \"You could say the football we'd played saved our lives. The football lads were fitter, yes, but more than that, they belonged to a group which kept each other going on the march.\" E715 was located close to Auschwitz III, Monowitz, which held mainly Polish resistance fighters, political dissidents, homosexuals and some captured Soviet troops. Whilst this was not officially a death camp, Mr Jones says it did not take long for him to realise that the inmates at Monowitz were far from safe. \"In the nights you could hear shots coming from Monowitz,\" he said. \"Not bursts like you had when you were fighting, but deliberate, regular every few seconds; like they had a system going. \"We didn't know who they were or why they'd been killed, and we couldn't help but be terrified that we'd be next.\" But when the British PoWs were allowed out to play football, they would be taken to fields next to Auschwitz II, Birkenau, where killing was on an altogether more industrial scale. \"The first Sunday we went to the playing fields, we saw these people - well walking skeletons they were really - digging trenches,\" he said. \"We asked, 'Who are those poor sods?' and the German guards shout 'Juden', Jews, as if it had been a stupid question. \"We could only play in the summer, because everything was covered in snow through the winter. But when it was hot, this awful stench would waft across from the crematoriums. \"Your imaginations pretty much filled in the gaps for you, but we'd carry on playing football. \"Scoring a goal, making a save or arguing about an offside was the only way you could stop yourself from cracking up.\" Mr Jones says he has spent a great deal of time since the war wondering about how much his German guards had known and cared about what was going on inside Birkenau. \"You have to remember that our guards weren't SS like in Birkenau; they were conscripted squaddies like us,\" he said. \"Dozens of them would come and cheer our football matches and have a laugh with us, and if you got them on their own, you could tell that they were ordinary, decent blokes. \"But if you asked them about Birkenau they'd get angry and scared. 'We didn't need to know', 'they didn't know', 'it was nothing', and even if it was, then 'it wasn't their fault, they weren't SS'.\" \"I had nightmares about Auschwitz for years after the war, but I bet mine were nothing compared with what those Germans must have gone through. \"Some would say they deserve it, but most likely they couldn't have done any more about it than we could have ourselves.\" As the Red Army closed in, on 21 January, 1945 German guards burst into Mr Jones's hut in the middle of the night, and ordered him to leave immediately with whatever he could carry. The Soviets liberated Auschwitz on 27 January, 1945, confirming for the first time the stories of the Holocaust's mass murder, which the Allies had hitherto rubbished as too extreme to be possible. But by the time the Russians arrived, Mr Jones was long gone; as part of the death march west, which killed anywhere between 3,000 and 8,000 Allied PoWs. \"We were on the road for 17 weeks, and God knows how many hundreds of miles we traipsed, through Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany and Austria.\" \"I was 13 stone (82kg) when I was captured, and when I was liberated by the Americans in April 1945, they weighed me, and I was seven stone.\" Mr Jones considers himself one of the lucky ones. \"I was very lucky. I came home to a good wife, who helped me get over it. But lots never really recovered at all,\" he said. \"I think I'm probably the last now. There was another of the footballers who I got Christmas cards from, but there was nothing this year.

{"article": "The mythical ruler's legendary court has been associated with locations throughout Wales, including Carmarthen, St David's, and Cardigan. Now a retired Bangor University professor has revealed what he believes to be the true location of Camelot. And it turns out to be a small Roman fort at Slack, on the outskirts of Huddersfield in West Yorkshire. Prof Peter Field, a renowned expert in Arthurian literature, said: \"It was quite by chance. I was looking at some maps, and suddenly all the ducks lined up. \"I believe I may have solved a 1,400-year-old mystery.\" Previous best guesses for the location of the round table include Caerleon in Newport, Somerset's Cadbury Castle, and Tintagel in Cornwall. In Roman times, Slack was home to a fort called Camulodunum, which means \"the fort of the god Camul\". Over the years, well-recognised linguistic processes would have reduced Camulodunum to Camelot. Though almost forgotten and insignificant today, and even though it was abandoned and dilapidated by the relevant time of King Arthur around A.D. 500, Prof Field argues that this site at Slack would still have been considered a strategic stronghold. At that time, Celtic-speaking Britons, who could have been led by King Arthur, held the north and the west coast against the invading Anglo-Saxons. Slack, on the Roman road from Chester to York, would have been the ideal location from which to defend the east coast. Prof Field added: \"If there was a real King Arthur, he will have lived around AD500, although the first mention of him in Camelot is in a French poem from the Champagne region of France from 1180. \"There is no mention of Camelot in the period between those dates, known as the Dark Ages, when the country was at war, and very little was recorded. \"In this gap, people passed on information, much got lost in transmission, and people may have made up facts or just messed up known information.\" Prof Field, who taught at Bangor from 1964 to 2004, has been researching the location of Camelot for the past 18 months.

{"article": "The aid package, worth 500m euros (\u00a3365m), was announced at a meeting of EU farm ministers in Brussels. It is understood the bulk of the money will be used to support the dairy sector in the various member countries. But there will be no increase in the milk intervention price, a key demand of Northern Ireland's dairy industry. It is the price at which Europe buys milk and milk powders to shore up the market and currently stands at about 16 to 17p. The commission said raising the price was not the \"appropriate policy\" and would not solve the current market problem. It added that it would create an \"artificial outlet\" for EU dairy products, pushing market prices further down. The commission's aid package is intended to help farmers' cash flow problems and stabilise agricultural markets. However, DUP MEP Diane Dodds said it \"falls well short\" of what is needed. She called on EU Agriculture Commissioner Phil Hogan to rethink and do more, especially on the milk intervention price. Agriculture Minister Michelle O'Neill said: \"We have thousands of farmers on the streets of Brussels here today waiting for answers and waiting for a glimmer of hope in terms of what support they're going to achieve. \"That information still isn't clear at this minute in time.\" During the talks, thousands of European farmers held protests near the EU headquarters over falling farm produce prices and many blocked streets with tractors. Representatives of Northern Ireland's farming industry were among those attending the demonstrations, 23 of them from the UFU. In the meeting, the commission said it would give member states the flexibility to advance up to 70% of direct subsidy payments to farmers and 85% of rural development payments from 16 October. They are normally paid in December. The commission said it would allow for flexibility about the checks normally done before payment. However, the UFU questioned whether, given the complexity of checks under the new Common Agricultural Policy payment system, farmers would get their money any earlier. The aid package includes new private storage schemes for dairy protein products and pigmeat; an attempt to remove trade barriers in non-EU countries and more missions to non-EU countries in an attempt to open new markets. Farmers have been under pressure for some time, due in part to a Russian ban on EU food imposed in response to EU sanctions over Ukraine. A slowdown in the Chinese economy and the shrinking of markets in some oil producing countries has also had an impact. Northern Ireland's farmers have the complication of a weak euro, making their exports to the Eurozone more expensive. In the dairy sector, 85% of milk produced in Northern Ireland is destined for the export market. Latest figures show that in July, farmers in Northern Ireland got 18.87p a litre for milk - about 10p a litre below production cost.", "abstract": "The Ulster Farmers' Union (UFU) has said it is \"disappointed\" by the aid package for European farmers announced by the European Commission.", "candidate": "The European Commission has announced a multi-million pound aid package to help struggling European farmers.", "doc_id": 58, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "The aid package, worth 500m euros (\u00a3365m), was announced at a meeting of EU farm ministers in Brussels.", "explanation": "The source text says that the European Commission announced the package.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}
{"article": "Chapman's Ice Cream initially offered to purchase Beavercrest Community School in Markdale for about CA$1m ($741,000; \u00c2\u00a3596,000). \"This is the community that helped build us to what we are,\" vice-president Ashley Chapman told the BBC. Although regulations and an asbestos problem might make buying the school difficult, he said the company will work with the school board to come up with a solution that works, and intends to help cover some costs. \"Somebody's got to step to the plate and somebody's got to help fix the situation,\" he said. Mr Chapman proposed buying the building and leasing it back to the school board at a reasonable rate in order to keep the school open. But the aging building could require millions of dollars worth of repairs, and regulations make it tricky for a private company to buy a public building still intended for public use. \"Essentially what we were proposing was a giant band aid to delay the situation,\" he said. The school is one of about 600 - many in rural areas - that the province has earmarked to be shut down in order to save costs. If Beavercrest were to close, children from the town would have to spend up to 90 minutes in a bus commuting to one of three other schools in the area. It has 195 students but has a capacity for 319, according to a recent report by the local school board. \"We all realise that something needs to happen and something needs to change, but whatever happens needs to benefit the students,\" he said. An alumnus of Beavercrest himself, Mr Chapman said helping isn't just the right thing to do, it's smart business. Chapman's, which was founded in 1973 by his parents, is one of the largest ice cream manufacturers in Canada and has doubled its workforce over the past six years, he said. The company intends to expand even more, and that means they need to attract people to the small town of Markdale, which has a population of just 1,325. Mr Chapman said he's already struggled to attract people to the area, even after raising wages. \"Where are these people going to come from, especially if we don't have an elementary school in this area?\" he said.", "abstract": "A Canadian ice cream manufacturer hopes it can give something back to its local community, by keeping an elementary school in Ontario province from shutting down.", "candidate": "A Canadian ice cream company has stepped in to save a school in a small Newfoundland town from closure.", "doc_id": 59, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "A Canadian ice cream company has stepped in to save a school in a small town called Beavercrest from closure.", "evidence": "Chapman's Ice Cream initially offered to purchase Beavercrest Community School in Markdale for about CA$1m ($741,000; \u00c2\u00a3596,000).", "explanation": "The source text does not mention that the town is in Newfoundland.", "instruction": "Replace the information about the province that the town is in with the information about the name of the town.", "instruction_list": ["Replace the information about the province that the town is in with the information about the name of the town."]}}

But police in Maharashtra state on Monday confirmed the couple had \"morphed photographs\" to show a successful ascent on 23 May. The inquiry was launched after the pair's claims were queried by climbers. Additional Commissioner Sahebrao Patil told the PTI news agency that the couple \"shared misleading information\" and \"brought disrepute to the Maharashtra Police department\". It's not clear if the couple will also face charges. Nepalese authorities also imposed a 10-year mountaineering ban last year on the couple after concluding that their claim was fake. The country's tourism department had initially certified their ascent but rescinded that decision after conducting an investigation. Mr and Mrs Rathod initially told reporters that their pictures were real. But a climber based in the southern Indian city of Bangalore, Satyarup Sidhantha, later told the media that the photographs presented by the Rathods as \"proof\" of their climb actually belonged to him. Suspicions were further aroused because of the time lag between the day the Rathods claimed to have reached the summit and their news conference announcing their achievement.

{"article": "Former England batsman Boycott said Morgan was not \"as good as he thinks he is\" and \"not so clever\" against top-class bowling. But pace bowler Anderson responded: \"That's rich coming from him. Media playback is not supported on this device . \"Morgan is a world-class player and has been for over 100 games. We know how destructive he is when he's in form.\" Boycott, who scored 1,082 runs in 34 one-day innings for England, at an average of 36.06, was passing judgement on a poor sequence of form that has seen Morgan dismissed for less than 20 in nine of his last 11 one-day international innings. Anderson, though, defended his captain, saying: \"He has been great for us. We're hopeful he can get some form. We've seen him get a hundred on this trip against Australia.\" The 32-year-old was speaking before England's opening World Cup game against co-hosts Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday (03:30 GMT). Former England captain Michael Vaughan said Morgan had never claimed to be \"the greatest\", but disagreed with Boycott's comments. \"I think he can have his opinion,\" said Vaughan. \"I work with him, respect him a lot, I like him, but I disagree with what he's said about Eoin Morgan. \"He needs runs, but in the past Morgan has had the kind of mentality to produce on the big stage.\" More than 90,000 spectators are expected to be in attendance as England look to improve on a run that has seen them lose 13 of their last 15 ODIs against Australia down under. \"It's obviously a big game for both sides,\" said Anderson, who has taken 264 wickets in 188 matches since making his debut at the MCG in 2002. \"As a cricketer, you want to play in big games like this. We're guessing that the majority of the crowd will be against us, so it's something we're prepared for. It's something that we have to try to soak up and enjoy. \"We feel confident that we can beat anyone on our day. Confidence is building in our team and we're hoping that we can put things together when it really matters.\" With Australia captain Michael Clarke ruled out of Saturday's opener because of injury, George Bailey has been confirmed as his replacement. However, Bailey admitted that he was likely to lose his place in the team when Clarke returns for the second match against Bangladesh. The 32-year-year-old batsman also said that Australia should enjoy the extra support they receive as co-hosts, rather than feel the pressure of being favourites to win the tournament. \"I don't think I'll keep my place, but that's fine,\" said Bailey. \"I think it's great that Michael is on track to come back, he's done a remarkable job to be available for the Bangladesh game. \"I'm not feeling the pressure of expectation. We get to enjoy some home comforts and home support. We should embrace the opportunity of a home World Cup. \"There have been some amazing Australian players who have never had the chance of a home World Cup. You can view that as pressure, or view it as a wonderful opportunity.\" With so much of the conversation in Australia surrounding the fitness of Clarke, former leg-spinner Shane Warne had his say on the process the captain has had to get through since injuring his right hamstring on 13 December. \"Some of the stuff I've been reading about Michael Clarke, you'd think he was 45. He's only 33,\" said Warne, who is 45 himself. \"They've tried to break him with all the fitness stuff, but he's ready to go, fitter than he's ever been in five years. I would have picked him.\" Warne, a World Cup winner in 1999, also said England were capable of shocking Australia on Saturday and identified Ravi Bopara - whose place may be under threat - as one of the key men. \"England need James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Ian Bell, Eoin Morgan and Ravi Bopara to fire. If a few of those guys have a day out at the World Cup, they could go all the way.\" In an attempt to ramp up the tension and create a partisan atmosphere before the Australia-England match, a betting company has placed posters around Melbourne that read \"Missing: pair of balls.

{"article": "I'd been selected as one of 24 mid-career professionals from around the world to take up a Rotary International peace fellowship. It involved three months studying peace and conflict at Chulalongkorn University, in Thailand. My classmates would be peacekeepers who had seen war and conflict up close. They were professors and activists from places such as Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ireland, Zimbabwe and Nepal. The hope was we'd graduate brimming with solutions to help a world that, let's face it, needs people minded to try to find peace where they can. But I'd only been in Bangkok two days when I realised I had a problem. As I looked down after seven hours of exploring the streets, I saw my feet, swollen in the heat, were bleeding - cut to pieces by my seven-year-old weathered sandals. With temperatures set to rise, and school starting early the next morning, I had to buy new footwear. They had to be respectable, so my trainers wouldn't cut it. We had been warned before we came out that Thailand was still in the midst of a year-long mourning period for the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej. My outfits, therefore, had to be suitable from head to toe, especially since I was attending the royal university. I left my room in a rush and spotted a chap in my dorm corridor. \"Are you new? Are you a Rotary fellow too? Want to help me buy shoes?\" Andrew Miles, a policeman from Melbourne, knew when he had been ambushed. Fifteen minutes later, we found ourselves in the midst of the MBK shopping centre. Ten minutes after that and 500 baht (\u00c2\u00a311) poorer, I had in my hand two pairs of sandals that could easily be slipped off at temples and people's homes, as the Thai culture required, and could also cope with swelling feet in Bangkok's rising heat. Global education . Get in touch with the Global education series. The sandals certainly got a battering. As a vegetarian, Bangkok's street food proved a bit of challenge. Lesson one: to find peace, learn as much of the language of the country you've moved to as quickly as you can - especially when it comes to meal time. This will prevent \"hanger\" (when you get angry because you are so hungry). Lesson two: be ready to walk, and walk and walk as you try to find somewhere that can cater for your strict dietary requirements. Be careful of getting overexcited by meal spots, as you may end up tripping over your toes. I can testify that falling flat on your bottom on Bangkok's incredibly busy streets is not a good look. At first, things went well. School was a 10-minute walk away, and guest lecturers included Buddhist monks, military generals and academics with years of experience in peace studies. Topics included storytelling and peace and conflict analysis tools. Friendships and bonds emerged through this unique programme. Where else would a London journalist like me end up sharing washing powder with Natasha Dimitrovska - a feminist from Macedonia - or have daily morning coffee with Manty Hasan- a peace activist living in Aceh, Indonesia? I was following in the footsteps of more than 400 peace fellows who had studied peace and conflict at the Thailand centre. But those shoes were not what I thought I'd bargained for. The rubber soles on one pair gave away in the heat and when you live a student life, you revert to cheap fixes. One message I sent to the group's WhatsApp chat included: \"I accidently superglued my sandal to the floor; anyone got any nail polish remover I could borrow?\" One day, Travis Burke, an American classmate who had worked in war zones, sewed together my other pair of broken sandals with a travel kit he had had the foresight to bring with him. Lesson three: a needle and thread is a life-essential for any emerging cracks. Designer Christian Louboutin has called shoes a \"communication tool between people\", and that leads to lesson four. Resolving conflict is about finding things in common. Even things that might seem insignificant. Like shoes. We were on a field trip to Sri Lanka to look at the after-effects of the civil war, which had almost destroyed the country. As we drove down in the coach from Jaffna, in the north, to Sri Lanka's capital, Colombo, the pounding those fake leather shoes had taken meant that the buckle snapped again. This time, the attempts by Travis and Kenyan farmer Emmanuel Karisa Baya to fix them with the adhesive tape led to something quite unexpected. Travis started playing his ukulele, and Kemuel Laeta, a Solomon Islander with a water-bottle tambourine, and two Kenyans, Karisa and Dan Noel Odaba began a jamming session. The combination of this motley crew who tried to fix my shoes led to not just an idea for a global business venture but an accompanying jingle - Mzungu Repair. The word 'Mzungu' means 'white person' in Swahili and the original repair shop would be founded by Travis and Karisa with franchises elsewhere. This petri dish of voices from different cultures blended together. The tape was a temporary fix - my shoes were a write-off. But the song brought people from 19 different countries together, not quite in vocal harmony but, certainly, in peace.

{"article": "Mr Duckenfield was match commander at the FA Cup semi-final when 96 Liverpool fans were fatally injured in a crush. Ex-South Yorkshire Police (SYP) Ch Insp Sir Norman Bettison, two officers, a solicitor and a Sheffield Wednesday club secretary also face charges. The Prime Minister said it would be a day of \"mixed emotions\" for families. Last year, new inquests into the disaster at the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest match, held at Sheffield Wednesday's ground, concluded the fans had been unlawfully killed. The inquests found that Liverpool supporters were not responsible for the dangerous situation at the Leppings Lane turnstiles. For legal reasons, Mr Duckenfield cannot be charged over the death of the 96th victim, Tony Bland, as he died four years after the disaster, prosecutors said. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) must apply to the High Court to lift an order imposed after he was prosecuted privately in 1999, which must be removed before he can be charged. An application will be made to the High Court in a matter of weeks and a senior judge will make a ruling in due course. The full list of individuals and charges are: . The six men charged over Hillsborough . Hillsborough: Criminal charges explained . The defendants, other than Mr Duckenfield, will appear at Warrington Magistrates' Court on 9 August. No organisation will face corporate charges and no-one from the ambulance service will be charged, said Sue Hemming, head of special crime and counter-terrorism at the CPS. She explained that Sheffield Wednesday is now a \"different company\" and, as it is not a successor organisation, is not criminally liable for any offences that might have been committed in 1989. \u00c2\u00a356.5m . cost of Operation Resolve . \u00c2\u00a342m . cost of IPCC investigation . 17,000 lines of inquiry by Operation Resolve . 11,000 statements taken by Operation Resolve . 190,000 documents reviewed by IPCC investigation . 23,000 images reviewed by IPCC investigation . The CPS brought charges following referrals from the Operation Resolve investigation into the causes of the disaster and the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) probe. Assistant Commissioner Rob Beckley, from Operation Resolve, said: \"Our inquiry looked at all aspects of the event, including the planning and the preparation for the game, the safety of the stadium and the response by the emergency services.\" The IPCC investigated the conduct of both SYP and West Midlands Police (WMP) in the days and weeks afterwards. Any decision regarding WMP, which was brought in to carry out the original investigation into the conduct of SYP officers, will be made at a later date. Ms Hemming made the announcement of the intended prosecutions to victims' families at a private meeting in Warrington earlier. She said: \"Following our careful review of the evidence, in accordance with the code for Crown prosecutors, I have decided that there is sufficient evidence to charge six individuals with criminal offences. \"Criminal proceedings have now commenced and the defendants have a right to a fair trial.\" Campaigner Trevor Hicks, whose daughters Victoria, 15, and Sarah, 19, died in the disaster, said: \"There will be six people facing criminal charges who might not have done if we hadn't been resilient and all stuck together and fought this long fight. \"There are no winners in this, it doesn't bring anybody back. \"What it does do is send a message about accountability, as we keep saying, that nobody but nobody is above the law; be it the police or anybody else.\" Chairwoman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Margaret Aspinall, whose son James, 18, was killed, said: \"This is definitely the start of the end. \"I think everybody needs that, I think we all need peace from Hillsborough but we can never have peace until we've got truth, justice, accountability. \"I think that's the time we'll all have peace.\" Barry Devonside, whose son Christopher, 18, was killed in the disaster, said: \"Everybody applauded when it was announced that the most senior police officer on that particular day will have charges presented to him.\" Evelyn McDonnell Mills, whose brother Peter McDonnell, 21, died, said she was \"really happy\", but sad that her brother who campaigned for years and died during the new inquests never got to see their conclusion. Pete Weatherby QC, who represents 22 of the victims' families, said they had \"always known that accountability is the most difficult objective\". \"They remain keen to see the criminal process properly pursued for those who have been charged and given that, the rights of the defendants should be respected. \"They do however hope that the memories of their loved ones and the integrity of the fans who attended Hillsborough will be respected during the process.\" BBC News profiles of all those who died . At Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May said: \"I know from working closely with the families when I was home secretary that this will be a day of mixed emotions for them.\" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn offered a \"tribute to all of those that spent a great deal of time trying to ensure there was justice for those that died at Hillsborough\". Dr Alan Billings, the South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner, said he hoped the start of criminal proceedings would \"lead to a measure of closure for the family members who have experienced a long and traumatic process\". Sheffield Wednesday said the club had no comment to make. Mr Duckenfield and Mr Denton's legal representative Ian Lewis, from JMW Solicitors, said: \"In light of the decision by the Crown Prosecution Service to commence criminal proceedings against David Duckenfield and Donald Denton, it would be inappropriate for me as their solicitor, or for my clients themselves, to make any comment.\" Mr Metcalf declined to comment.", "abstract": "Former Ch Supt David Duckenfield faces 95 charges of manslaughter and five other senior figures will be prosecuted over the 1989 Hillsborough disaster.", "candidate": "Former Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield is one of six people charged over the 1989 disaster.", "doc_id": 67, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "The six men charged over Hillsborough .

He rejected criticism from those who say he is mistaking the enthusiasm of his backers for wider electoral appeal. Ex-leader Neil Kinnock said Labour appeared unelectable under Mr Corbyn and faced its \"greatest crisis\". Labour will announce whether Mr Corbyn or Owen Smith have won the leadership contest on 24 September. Ahead of the vote, Mr Smith accused Mr Corbyn of seeking to \"deepen divisions\" between the party's membership - seen as overwhelmingly in favour of the leader - and its MPs - who are largely opposed to him. But asked if he would quit as leader if he thought he could not take the party to power, Mr Corbyn told Today he was \"determined\" to lead it into the next general election and said it could win. Referring to the \"diverse\" crowds of tens of thousands of people who have attended his leadership rallies in recent weeks, Mr Corbyn said they showed \"there is an interest in politics... that then becomes surely a very strong campaigning base for the Labour movement\". He added: \"I think you'll see it begin to play out, particularly in the local elections next year and after that.\" In June, 20 members of the shadow cabinet resigned, and one was sacked, over differences with Mr Corbyn. Five told the BBC on Sunday they would return if asked by Mr Corbyn should he be re-elected, while nine others said they would stand if shadow cabinet elections were revived. Mr Corbyn told Today he would \"reach out to\" Labour MPs who have opposed his leadership \"as I've reached out to them in the past\". He said: \"I have made it my business to talk to quite a lot of Labour MPs and will continue to do so and I hope they will understand that we've been elected as Labour MPs... \"It doesn't mean everybody agrees on everything all the time - that I understand - but the general direction of opposition to austerity, opposing the Tories on grammar schools, those are actually the kind of things that unite the party.\" On Tuesday, Labour's national executive committee meets and will consider a plan put forward by deputy leader Tom Watson to allow the parliamentary party - its MPs and peers currently serving in Westminster - to elect the shadow cabinet, as part of efforts to reunite the party as a whole.

{"article": "Chechen Muslim clerics met on 3 April, two days after the paper's revelations, and said the report had insulted their faith and the dignity of Chechen men. \"Retribution will catch up with the true instigators, wherever and whoever they are,\" their resolution said. Novaya Gazeta says it amounts to a call for \"reprisals against journalists\". \"We urge the Russian authorities to do everything possible to prevent actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity towards journalists, who are doing their professional duty,\" the paper said. On 1 April it reported that more than 100 people had been detained in Chechnya on suspicion of being homosexual, and that at least three had been killed. The Russian LGBT Network, in touch with victims in Chechnya, told the BBC that the report was true. Homophobia is rife in the mainly Muslim North Caucasus republic. Authoritarian leader Ramzan Kadyrov is fiercely loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin. A spokeswoman for the LGBT Network said detainees were tortured with electric shocks and beatings at a prison near Argun, 20km (13 miles) from the city of Grozny. \"All the people arrested are homosexual men or perceived as being gay,\" said Natalia Poplevskaya. Ramzan Kadyrov has denied the allegations, calling them \"lies\". His spokesman Alvi Karimov said there were no gay people in Chechnya. The Chechens' spiritual leader, Mufti Salah-haji Mezhiev, confirmed that \"retribution\" was part of the resolution adopted at the special Muslim meeting in Grozny on 3 April. \"There will be retribution!\" he told the Russian news website RBC. \"Allah will punish those who slandered the whole Chechen nation and Chechen Republic's clerics.\" Novaya Gazeta's 1 April report said the detainees included some influential Muslim clerics close to Mr Kadyrov, and two well-known Chechen TV presenters. In an open letter to the mufti, the paper's chief editor Dmitry Muratov said his journalists would continue investigating human rights abuses in Chechnya. \"We did not insult - nor had we the slightest intention to insult - the Chechen people,\" he wrote, urging dialogue. Chechens have been linked to two murders of Novaya Gazeta reporters who investigated crimes in Chechnya - Anna Politkovskaya and Natalia Estemirova. But much remains unclear about those contract killings, and that of Boris Nemtsov, an opposition politician who was shot dead in Moscow in 2015 and also exposed corruption and organised crime in Chechnya. The LGBT Network says it is helping people to flee the persecution in Chechnya and accuses the Russian authorities of ignoring the abuses.

{"article": "My sources include collectors all over the world, dealers, auctions, flea markets, and just about any place I can think of. The accumulation, as I like to call it, includes all kinds of material related to the Indian matchbox industry. Within this rapidly growing accumulation, I often come across labels and subjects that I get curious about and that is how my collection takes a thematic approach. My recent exhibition, titled \"Matchbox Labels And The Stories They Tell\", features some prominent trends and themes spanning the entire history of the matchbox industry. I exhibited 5,000 labels from my collection of 25,000. AE Matcheswala was an early matchbox label which started using sulphur. It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two. The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands. This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement. It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today. Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s. Some labels even featured Pakistani films.

He has presented the Scottish dance music show Take the Floor since the early 1980s.

But Robbie has decided it is now time to step down from the show - and this weekend will be his final programme as permanent host. Born in Dunecht in Aberdeenshire in 1936, he admits that when he first entered broadcasting he was initially \"slated\" for his accent in some quarters, and was just a \"rough and ready country loon\". Since then his work has been recognised with an MBE, and he was also inducted into a hall of fame by the Trad Music Awards. His career has included stints on BBC Scotland's Beechgrove Garden and presenting televised sheepdog trials. As well as his broadcast work, Robbie has been a regular commentator on the Highland Games circuit - including the famous Braemar Gathering which is attended by The Queen and members of the royal family - and a much-travelled concert compere. He has written books on Scottish dance music and Scottish country dancing, and has written a newspaper column in Doric. Robbie, who turned 80 in May this year, prepares for Take the Floor at BBC Scotland's Beechgrove Terrace base.

It's got everything and that's why everyone needs to tune in.\" Brook is bidding to succeed where domestic rival Amir Khan failed - Bolton's Khan jumped two weight divisions to fight then WBC champion Saul Alvarez in May and was knocked out in six rounds.

{"article": "The Anglo-Dutch giant's chief executive Ben van Beurden accepted that Arctic drilling \"divides society\", but said the world needs new sources of oil. Greenpeace said Shell was taking a \"massive risk\" in a \"pristine\" region. Shell also announced a $15bn (\u00c2\u00a39.9bn) cut in global spending, and profit figures that disappointed investors. The cut in investment - spread over three years - comes after a fall in the oil price. Although the price is expected to remain lower in the medium term, Mr van Beurden said: \"We are taking a prudent approach here and we must be careful not to over-react to the recent fall in oil prices. \"Shell is taking structured decisions to balance growth and returns.\" Shell also said profits for the last three months of 2014 had risen to $4.2bn compared with $2.2bn in the same period a year earlier. The numbers were below analysts' forecasts, prompting a big sell-off of Shell's shares, which were down by 4.3% at the end of Thursday. Shell put its Arctic plans on hold two years ago after a drilling vessel ran aground and legal wrangles in the US. The company has already spent $1bn on preparing its drilling work in Alaska's Chukchi Sea. It was costing Shell several hundred millions of dollars a year to keep the existing operations ticking over, the company said. Mr van Beurden said there were still issues to resolve before drilling began, such as over operating permits and getting further facilities in place. But he hoped to see work begin in the summer. \"We will only do this if we feel that we can do it responsibly,\" Mr van Beurden told the BBC. \"I think that we are as well prepared as any company can be to mitigate the risks.\" He also pointed out that there are already other energy companies operating in the Arctic. Mr van Beurden said that the world needs new sources of oil and gas to meet demand and that the Arctic offered potentially the biggest resource base ever found. Estimates have put the estimates at some 24bn barrels in Alaska. Environmentalists have campaigned against Shell for years. Greenpeace's Charlie Kronick, said: \"Despite announcing cuts [in global investment], Shell hasn't taken the opportunity to cut its most high-cost high-risk project. \"Shell is taking a massive risk doggedly chasing oil in the Arctic, not just with shareholder value, but with the pristine Arctic environment. \"A spill there will be environmentally and financially catastrophic. It's time for investors to recognise that it's impossible for Shell to justify its continued pursuit of offshore Arctic oil.\" As the first of the major oil companies to report its figures for last year, Shell plays the role of the canary in the coal mine - or on the oil rig. After a rather sickly 2013, profits are actually up. But the impact of the low oil price is clearly biting. The company announced that it would be cutting investment over the next three years in new exploration and the development of oil and gas fields, a move that will raise fresh concerns about its business in the North Sea. Last summer Shell announced the loss of 250 jobs in Aberdeen. The chief executive, Ben Van Beurden, said that the company would not \"over-react\" to the oil price which has fallen by 60% since last June. And of course a low oil price means lower prices at the petrol pumps for consumers. He said though that Shell would look at further cuts if necessary. As well as the North Sea, the company's operations in Nigeria, where it recently paid a \u00c2\u00a355m bill to clean up pollution after a major oil spill, and the Arctic will also come under increased scrutiny. Meanwhile, Shell's profits for the quarter after stripping out one-off items, such as asset sales and accounting changes, were $3.26bn. That is a 12% rise on the same period a year earlier but down from the $5.85bn in the June to September quarter. Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: \"As expected, fourth quarter performance has been impacted by the lower oil price, although downstream refining operations have provided some counterbalance. \"More broadly, the numbers are below forecast, with the news providing a difficult start to the oil majors' results season. \"In all, and despite the disappointing numbers, the dividend payment remains core, with the payment being left unchanged.\" Shell said it was spending $12bn on dividends to shareholders in 2014, and also repurchased $3.3bn of its own shares. The group said it had slowed the pace of share buybacks to conserve cash and that near-term oil prices would dictate how it progressed. Oil prices have fallen by almost 60% since June because of weak global demand and a boom in US shale production.

This was also a fall from 5,400 in the same quarter last year. Lenders said low interest rates were keeping the numbers down but homeowners must prepare for a rate rise. \"This trend is very welcome. Low interest rates are acting as a significant support for homeowners in general, and are likely to be helping to stave off low level arrears for stretched households in particular,\" said CML director general Paul Smee. \"As ever, we urge borrowers to think ahead to when interest rates rise, and to contact their lender without delay if they are in difficulty. Prompt action helps to prevent problems worsening.\" Earlier this week, it was revealed that more than a million householders had never experienced a rise in the Bank of England's base rate while owning a home. Some 11.1 million mortgages are outstanding in the UK, with loans worth more than \u00c2\u00a31.3 trillion. The CML figures showed that 1,800 homes were repossessed from owner-occupiers, and 700 were seized from landlords in in the buy-to-let market in the second quarter of the year. The number of owners falling into arrears on mortgage repayments had also fallen in the second three months of the year compared with the first quarter, the CML said.

He aims to open dialogue about \"the recent atrocities committed by some hateful people\" that were responsible for the \"destruction and desecration of the graves of people of Jewish faith\".

Other Muslims, including Emmy Award-winning TV Broadcaster Momin Bhatti took to social media to pledge their support in his call to protect Jewish sites. This latest show of solidarity comes shortly after an online Muslim-led crowdfunding campaign to help repair a vandalised Jewish cemetery raised more than $150,000 (\u00c2\u00a3122,000).

{"article": "They made the connection on an expedition to the boy's village, Meliandou. They took samples and chatted to locals to find out more about Ebola's source. The team's findings are published in EMBO Molecular Medicine. Meliandou is a small village of 31 houses. It sits deep within the Guinean forest region, surrounded by towering reeds and oil palm cultivations - these are believed to have attracted the fruit bats carrying the virus passed on to Emile. During their four-week field trip in April 2014, Dr Fabian Leendertz and colleagues found a large tree stump situated about 50m from Emile's home. Villagers reported that children used to play frequently in the hollow tree. Emile - who died of Ebola in December 2013 - used to play there, according to his friends. The villagers said that the tree burned on March 24, 2014 and that once the tree caught fire, there issued a \"rain of bats\". A large number of these insectivorous free-tailed bats - Mops condylurus in Latin - were collected by the villagers for food, but disposed of the next day after a government-led ban on bushmeat consumption was announced. While bushmeat is thought to be a possible source of Ebola, the scientists believe it didn't trigger the outbreak. Instead, it was Emile's exposure to the bats and their droppings as he played with his friends in the hollowed tree. The scientists took and tested ash samples from the tree and found DNA traces that were a match for the animals. While they were unable to test any of the bushmeat that the villagers had disposed of, they captured and tested any living bats they could find in and around Meliandou. No Ebola could be detected in any of these hundred or so animals, however. But previous tests show this species of bat can carry Ebola. Dr Leendertz, from the Robert Koch Institute in Germany, and his colleagues say this must be a pretty rare occurrence though. Dr Leendertz said: \"That is also obvious when you think about how many tonnes of bat meat is consumed every year. \"If more bats carried the virus, we would see outbreaks all the time.\" He says it is vital to find out more about the bats. \"They have moved into human settlements. They do not just live in the trees but also under the roofs of houses in the villages. \"The Ebola virus must jump through colonies from bat to bat, so we need to know more.\" But culling the animals is not the answer. \"We need to find ways to live together with the wildlife.

Let's give Super League a pat on the back.\" National Rugby League clubs had won all six matches since the expanded World Club Series came into effect in 2015. Wane, whose side became the first from England to be crowned world champions since Leeds in 2012, added: \"Tony Smith did a great job with Warrington and we won fair and square. \"It's a fantastic feeling and I'm so pleased. The staff work hard but the players do their business out on the park. \"We did too much defending. I'm trying to stay positive and not think about how we played. I'm just glad to get the win.\" Wigan had lost to Brisbane in each of the past two seasons and lost their last World Club Challenge fixture to Sydney Roosters in Australia in 2014.

{"article": "In a scrappy first half, Joe Garner drew a save from Aberdeen keeper Joe Lewis and crossed for Martyn Waghorn to volley over. Aberdeen dominated after the break as Wes Foderingham saved from Kenny McLean and twice from striker Adam Rooney. But Kenny Miller's brace and Joe Dodoo's third earned Rangers the win. Aberdeen are still well placed to finish runners-up to Premiership champions Celtic, with nine points and a far superior goal difference separating them from Rangers with only six games remaining. Derek McInnes's men started the match as favourites and the early signs suggested they would live up to their billing as they pressed, fought and chased Rangers across every inch of the pitch. It was more a bruising battle than a beautiful game, though, and referee Kevin Clancy was flashing cards early, with Garner and Ryan Jack the first to be booked as they squared up to each other. For all its lack of free-flowing football, it was a very watchable spectacle. Jonny Hayes forced a low save from Foderingham at one end and Waghorn should have burst the net rather than volleying over after a sumptuous cross from Garner on the right. The visitors actually enjoyed the best chances in the early stages despite their lack of fluidity in midfield. Rangers manager Pedro Caixinha said beforehand that his players were entering hell with this trip but it looked more like limbo as both sides continued to cancel each other out. The Portuguese was also well aware that anything other than victory would see his side consigned to third at best. The Ibrox side have obvious frailties at the moment, especially in defence where youngsters are deputising for more experienced injured regulars, but they showed fight and spirit that would be rewarded later in the match. Young David Bates looked slow and ponderous at times although Myles Beerman at left-back was composed and calm when needed. When Aberdeen click, it is mostly down to the hard work of their impressive wide men and so it was in the second half as Niall McGinn and Hayes terrorised the Rangers full-backs. Hayes skipped past two on his way to the box but Graeme Shinnie's hooked shot was blocked by Foderingham. McGinn was at it on the other side and his trickery was feeding Rooney but his fellow Irishman could not convert despite several gilt-edged invitations. You could sense the tide turning though and Rangers were struggling to contain the waves of red battering their defences. For all their efforts though, few chances were seriously testing Foderingham. With 11 minutes remaining, veteran striker Miller scored his 10th goal in 40 appearances this season. Against the run of play, Waghorn created space for himself in the box and when his shot was saved, 37-year-old Miller lashed a fabulous effort high into the back of the net. Aberdeen had no time to compose themselves before Miller made it two when he skipped through a defence in disarray to slide neatly past Lewis and send the small band of Rangers fans wild. Substitute Dodoo played his part in that second goal and he slammed home a third to complete an incredible five minute turnaround that sent the Dons fans scurrying for the exits in disbelief. Those who remained in defiance almost witnessed a Miller hat-trick as he followed up on Dodoo's shot that came back off the crossbar but defender Andrew Considine spared further blushes as he cleared off the line.

Last year, scientists pinpointed a human gene that they think was behind the expansion of a key brain region known as the neocortex.

Mrs May noted Sir Tony Robinson, who played Baldrick, was a Labour member. Sir Tony later described the pair as \"a beardy man and a grumpy lady\". During Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Corbyn and Mrs May argued over the government's yet-to-be-announced stance for when negotiations for leaving the European Union begin next year. The Labour leader accused the prime minister of presiding over a \"shambolic Tory Brexit\" and called for clarity and warned of the effect of it might have on the Irish border.

{"article": "The Very Large Array (VLA) traced the presence of ammonia in the gas giant to study the circulation systems below the visible cloud tops. For features such as the planet's Great Red Spot - a huge storm that has raged for at least 400 years - the scientists can see something of its roots. The observations go many tens of kilometres into the atmosphere. \"What really excites me is just the level of detail we see,\" said team-member Michael Wong from the University of California, Berkeley. \"In our maps you can see different zones, turbulent features, vortices - even the Great Red Spot. \"This has all been made possible by an upgrade to the VLA and a new technique developed by one of our co-workers,\" he told BBC News. The Karl G Jansky Very Large Array is based in the desert of New Mexico, close to the town of Socorro. As its name suggests, it is multi-antenna telescope. The upgrade Dr Wong is referring to has made the facility a far more sensitive tool for studying the radio emissions coming from objects in space. And the new technique he mentions counters the smearing effect you would ordinarily expect to get if you took a long exposure of a rapidly rotating body (Jupiter's \"day\" lasts just 10 hours). The result is a wonderfully detailed impression of what is happening under the immediate surface of the many-banded weather systems that race across the top of planet's atmosphere. The team looks at the glow of ammonia because it is a tracer for the dynamical flow in the planet's gases, which are dominated by hydrogen and helium. At Earth, you might do something similar by using water as the tracer. \"We see the actual glow of the ammonia itself, and the variation in depth is correlated with brightness,\" explained Dr Wong. \"The deepest we can see in this dataset is about 12 Bar - 12 times the Earth's atmospheric pressure.\" Plumes of ammonia are observed to rise up in waves. The team writes in the journal Science that the ammonia in these plumes will eventually condense out at higher altitudes, and could explain the ammonia ice clouds detected by the Galileo spacecraft in the 1990s. \"All told, there is a wealth of information about the structure of Jupiter's atmosphere in these new VLA images,\" said Imke de Pater, the lead author on the Science paper. \"We hope to resolve a number of outstanding questions with these and future studies using similar techniques.\" Prof de Pater wants to try similar observations at the gas giants Saturn and Uranus.

It said drivers under the age of 22 will pay \u00a342 a year more on average, and Londoners will pay \u00a331 more. But even after the tax rise, car insurance premiums are likely to remain lower than they were three years ago. Premiums in the third quarter of 2012 were \u00a3406 on average, according to the Association of British Insurers (ABI). In the same quarter this year, the average premium was \u00a3379. However the AA said prices had risen significantly over the summer. \"Already, premiums have risen by nearly 10% over the past six months and the IPT rise will only pile on the misery,\" said Janet Connor, managing director of AA Insurance. She also warned that Sunday's increase could encourage some young people to drive without insurance. Hannah Maundrell, the editor in chief of money.co.uk, said the tax rise was a \"drop in the ocean\" compared with the amount that consumers could save by changing to another provider. She said drivers, for example, could save up to \u00a3223 a year by switching. Those affected by the tax rise include: .

{"article": "Figures show the number of women taking their holy vows has trebled in the past five years, from 15 in 2009 to 45 last year - the highest number since 1990. Fourteen of the women who entered convents in 2014 were aged 30 or under, the latest figures show. The Church says women are being drawn to religious life because of a \"gap in the market for meaning in our culture\". Sister Cathy Jones, from the National Office for Vocation, said: \"We are never going to be at the place we were at 50 years ago, Catholic culture was at a very different place. \"But the fact that more women are becoming nuns than there has been in the past 25 years shows that as a generation we have turned a corner.\" The figures show that in the 1980s around 80 women were becoming nuns each year but the numbers gradually declined until 2004 when only seven women joined a convent. The small number of entrants has gradually increased again in the last 10 years, reaching 45 in 2014. Sister Cathy said nuns were now less visible in communities but they were now doing more hidden work with trafficked women or working as counsellors. And she added that some women may have been driven to the work after having seen more poverty in the UK during the economic downturn. \"It doesn't tend to be those who are coming from quite vulnerable places who become nuns, but there are people who want to be reaching out to those on the margins, who join,\" she said. Theodora Hawksley, 29, was until recently a postdoctoral researcher in theology at the University of Edinburgh, but at the beginning of the year she decided to end her career as an academic, and begin her training to become a nun. She joined the Congregation of Jesus in January and is now living in their house in Willesden, north London, while taking the first steps towards making vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. Ms Hawksley said: \"In one sense it is a bit like trying to explain to somebody why you are marrying the person you are. You can list their qualities, but in the end it is a relationship of love. \"I don't have to worry now about practical things like making a career for myself. I'm free to go where I'm needed and meet people at the margins. \"You are not on your own. It is an unusual life choice, but you are not the only one making it. There are plenty of people asking themselves the same questions.\" She admitted some of her friends were a \"bit bewildered\" when she revealed her plans, but most have been very supportive. Last year the majority of new nuns - 27 out of 45 - chose to be active religious sisters, who have a ministry outside of the convent, working in a community in areas such as nursing or teaching. Religious sisters are often sent to live in different communities every few years, both in the UK or abroad.

{"article": "President Thein Sein said the deal had opened up the \"road to future peace\" in Myanmar, also known as Burma. But the most active of rebel groups have not signed the agreement, which comes after two years of negotiations. Myanmar has been engaged in armed conflict with various ethnic and other groups seeking greater autonomy since independence from the British in 1948. The violence has left tens of thousands dead over the years, displaced hundreds of thousands more and has been used by the military to justify its long hold on political power. Resolving the conflicts is seen as central to Myanmar's attempts to reform after decades of military rule. The government hopes Thursday's deal - which comes weeks ahead of general elections - will be the first step on a path to a lasting political settlement. Speaking at the lavish signing ceremony in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, Thein Sein said it was a \"historic day for Myanmar\". \"We have been able to launch a new road to a peaceful future of our country.\" The chairman of one of the armed groups, the Karen National Union (KNU), called it \"a new page in history and a product of brave and energetic negotiations\". The agreement is neither truly nationwide nor strictly speaking a ceasefire. In order to take part in this collective agreement the armed groups had to have previously signed a bilateral ceasefire with the government. So it is not actually halting any conflicts. This at times tortuous process has been about trying to get everyone to the start line before the next phase, political dialogue, gets under way. With only about half the groups having made it to the start line, the way forward from here will be ever more complex. Read more: Ceasefire marks milestone for Myanmar . But seven of the armed groups which have been involved in the talks did not sign the final deal. Among them is the largest, the United Wa State Army (UWSA), which has some 25,000 members operating on the border with China, and has largely remained on the sidelines of the talks. Also not signing was the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO), whose Independence Army (KIA) controls large areas of north-eastern Kachin state and has regularly clashed with the Burmese army since a ceasefire collapsed in 2011. Thein Sein said the government would \"continue with our efforts to bring the remaining organisations into the process\". \"The door is open for them,\" he said. Political discussions are now due to begin within months on the structure of a new, and probably more federal, system of government, says our correspondent. But there are still concerns that peace with the groups signing Thursday's agreement could be short lived, if the Burmese army ignores the ceasefire, as it has with others. Earlier this week, all of the groups signing were removed from the government's list of \"unlawful associations\", a step towards bringing them into mainstream politics.

{"article": "The government investigation said the bodies were burned at a rubbish dump hours after the students went missing. But the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights says it has found no evidence to support claims that the bodies were incinerated. The Mexican government is sending forensic experts to the area. The move was announced by Attorney General Arely Gomez Shortly after the IACHR report was published. Relatives have always rejected the official investigation. They accused the authorities of covering up the alleged involvement of high-ranking officials and possibly the army in the killings. The case shocked Mexico and led to weeks of protests against official impunity and the government of President Enrique Pena Nieto. Analysis: By Katy Watson, BBC News, Mexico City . This report confirms what many people have believed for a long time - that the government's investigation into the disappearance of the 43 students was deeply flawed. The families of the missing disagreed from the start with the government's version of events - now they've been vindicated. There is a lot that is still unknown - the report doesn't explain what happened to the students and only suggests possible motives. But what is clear is that the government needs to step up its efforts to get to the bottom of what actually happened. President Enrique Pena Nieto has been hugely criticised for his handling of this case - this report will heap yet more pressure on him. After a six-month investigation, the Washington-based IACHR released a report of nearly 500 pages urging the government to continue looking for the missing students. A Peruvian fire expert hired by the commission concluded that it was impossible for all the bodies to have been burned at the landfill site in the municipality of Cocula, in the western state of Guerrero. Jose Torero, from the University of Queensland in Australia, said it would have required 13 tonnes of tyres, 20 tonnes of wood and 13 tonnes of diesel to cremate the bodies. It would have taken the gang 60 hours to finish the job, he said. \"There is no evidence indicating the presence of a fire of the size [needed] for the cremation of even one body,\" Mr Torero concluded. The original probe said the trainee teachers were rounded up by corrupt policemen after travelling to the city of Iguala on 26 September and taking part in a protest over job discrimination. They are reported to have disrupted a rally planned by the mayor's wife later in the evening. They were then allegedly handed over to the local Guerreros Unidos (United Warriors) criminal gang, which was told to kill them and dispose of their bodies. Several people were arrested in the following days, including the mayor, his wife, local policemen and men accused of belonging to the local gang. The government said some of the people who took part in the killings led them to the landfill site. According to the original inquiry, forensic experts managed to retrieve there a fragment of a bone, which was identified as that of one of the missing students after DNA tests in Austria.", "abstract": "An independent investigation into the disappearance of 43 Mexican students nearly a year ago has rejected the government's account of events.", "candidate": "The Mexican government's investigation into the disappearance of 43 trainee teachers last year was \"deeply flawed\", a report says.", "doc_id": 2630, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "This report confirms what many people have believed for a long time - that the government's investigation into the disappearance of the 43 students was deeply flawed.", "explanation": "The original summary is correct because all its information matches that of the source text, namely the entity responsible for the investigation (the Mexican government), that it was 43 trainee teachers who disappeared, and that a report found the investigation \"deeply flawed.\"", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

{"article": "It was a week in which trading in China's markets was twice halted by a circuit breaker, before the authorities decided to suspend the measure. The Shanghai Composite closed 2% higher on Friday, but still ended the week down by about 10%. In London, the FTSE 100 was up 55.4 points, or 0.93%, at 6,009.4. In Frankfurt, the Dax was up 1.0%, while the Cac 40 in Paris was up 0.7%. On Thursday, markets in Europe and the US recorded steep losses after trading in China's stock markets closed within the first 30 minutes. The direct financial impact of lower share prices in China is moderate. There is not enough foreign investment in the Chinese market for it to be a major problem. The London consultancy Capital Economics has said foreigners own just 2% of shares. The issue is about whether the financial turbulence shines a light on wider issues about the economic slowdown in China: is the economy heading for what's called a \"hard landing\", too sharp a slowdown? China is now such a big force in the global economy that it would inevitably affect the rest of the world. It is the second largest economy and the second largest importer of both goods and commercial services. Read more from Andrew. Trading in China was volatile again on Friday, the first day since the suspension of the circuit breaker. The Chinese central bank also took steps to strengthen the yuan after the currency's weakness was taken as a sign of problems for the economy. Connor Campbell, an analyst at Spreadex, said the FTSE's rise on Friday was \"nothing to write home about, especially in the context of the near 6% plunge the UK index has witnessed since Monday\". However, he added, it did mark an important moment of calm that has been largely absent since 2016 got underway, something that could help matters heading into next week. Market attention now turns to the US unemployment figures, which are due out later on Friday. \"It takes quite something to relegate the US employment report to a footnote in this week's trading activity, but the China induced volatility seen over the past few days appears to have done the trick,\" said Michael Hewson from CMC Markets. \"As we come to the end of the week European equity markets look on course to post some of the worst weekly losses since the previous China induced volatility, seen last August.\" The BBC's Steve Evans in Beijing, says the reason for the volatility in China's mainland markets is that \"there's a class of share buyer who treats it almost like the dog track\". But these investors cannot fight gravity, and an enormously expensive share market has been brought to heel, he says. Anne Richards, chief investment officer at Aberdeen Asset Management, told the BBC she was \"seeing inexperience\" in some parts of the regulation of Chinese markets. The addition of inexperienced investors did not help, she said. \"That's not a good setup... but over time it will improve.\" Dr Nikos Paltalidis, a lecturer in Finance at Durham University Business School, added the lack of experience among investors was highlighted by the fact that the first six months of 2015 saw the Chinese stock market soar by about 50%, adding that the rise in stocks was \"disconnected from economic fundamentals\". \"Investors borrowed heavily to speculate on stocks, inflating a short-lived asset bubble.

{"article": "He said he still favoured the use of Sterling, but said the independence case needs \"refurbishment\". The MP believed a better case for the retention of the pound would prevent the independence case being \"gazumped\" by opponents in a future referendum. Had Scotland voted \"Yes\", the planned independence day would have been 24 March. When asked by BBC Scotland's political correspondent Glenn Campbell about the pro-independence camp's stance on currency, Mr Salmond said: \"I think the argument you have got to put forward is one which can withstand any position adopted by your opponents. \"So, you mustn't allow yourself to be gazumped by your opponents. \"Now, I think sterling is the right currency for Scotland, because of a whole range of reasons that we gave during the campaign.\" The former SNP leader was speaking a matter of weeks after current leader and Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, announced plans for a fresh campaign for independence. She told her party's spring conference in Glasgow, that she would hear \"concerns\" and \"address questions\". In September 2014, voters north of the border decided by 55% to 45% to stay part of the United Kingdom. The SNP's new strategy will begin in the summer, after May's Holyrood election and June's EU referendum. Ms Sturgeon said the party was prepared to challenge some of the answers it gave 18 months ago. Reacting to Mr Salmond's comments, Scottish Labour's Iain Gray said: \"As far as I can make out he seems to be arguing again for Sterlingisation, a proposal that would have meant Scotland would have become an independent country and at that very moment given up control over its currency and much of its fiscal policy. \"That didn't make sense in 2014, the majority of the Scottish public didn't think it made sense, and it still doesn't make sense now.\" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said Mr Salmond had \"a bit of a cheek\" in \"acknowledging 18 months after the fact that his currency case was always flawed\". She said: \"People in Scotland have been well served by the pound as part of the UK, particularly with all the shocks and instability we've seen over the last few years in the world economy. \"If there is a united push from the SNP to get us back to yet another referendum, I'll be standing full square behind the decision that we as a country made to stay part of the UK.\" Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said it was time to move on from the whole matter to focus on the \"big challenges\". He added: \"There's no doubt that currency was one of the weakest arguments during the referendum. But the SNP need to move on - we all need to move on from the last five years. It was dominated by independence. \"If we keep dragging over the coals from yesterday's argument, we'll never sort out the future.\" Scottish Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie said it was \"welcome\" and \"probably almost inevitable\" that the SNP would re-evaluate its position on the pound. He went on: \"That idea of a currency union failed to convince us, because Scotland would have been in a situation where it didn't have the freedom to set its own economic policy.

{"article": "Two years down the line, Jones has now become a mother - and says this has given her a new awareness of what mum-of-one Gemma Foster went through. \"Being a wife and a mother made me realise the gravitas of that unit falling apart, because I'd go home at night and I'd have a baby to put to bed,\" she says. \"So I think it definitely made me realise when two people get together and have a child out of love and then they split... what it is to parent a child and be in each other's lives when you are damaged and hurt without damaging and hurting a child.\" Jones brought her son to set - he doesn't appear in the show, but \"looked much better than I did\" on camera, she jokes. She's now looking forward to some down time with him. \"The work/life balance for anyone is hard, so I try to keep work separate,\" she explains. \"I feel very, very grateful because I did a lot of work and now I'm taking a lot of time off. So I'm there until Christmas now, just down the play park in my Converse.\" The second series of the BBC One drama takes up the action as Gemma's estranged husband Simon (Bertie Carvel) and his new family return to the fictional town of Parminster, where she lives and works. They are dealing with the bitter repercussions of divorce - with their son, Tom, caught in the middle. Jones admits it can be \"uncomfortable\" viewing at times but says the show has a \"weird, sexy edge to it\". \"We all know what it feels like to be in a room with an ex-partner,\" she goes on. \"Everybody has had a relationship, everyone has had exes, everybody has been in difficult circumstances. I'm sure myself and Bertie have had those thoughts and feelings; otherwise we wouldn't be able to draw on them. \"But at the same time, with the style of writing and the style of the programme, you're able to go further. \"It has a fantastical edge as well as being deep-rooted in naturalism. It also has an exaggerated way of showing how far you could go if you really wanted to.\" Carvel, who played Miss Trunchbull in West End musical Matilda, says he found Mike Bartlett's writing \"exciting\" and that the Doctor Foster plot was a \"real page-turner\". \"He gives us incredibly three-dimensional characters\", says the actor, adding that it was \"really fun\" to play a character who makes the audience change their opinion about him as the drama progresses. \"Often you find yourself looking at something from a really different point of view,\" he says. \"That's what's exciting about this series as a whole.\" Jones says the original plan was to give Gemma a new look. After conducting a screen test, though, it was agreed that it just didn't work. \"She's moved on, but actually she's comfortable with her bob and her work and she's put up her walls,\" says the former Coronation Street actress. \"It was the right decision to move her on but leave her embalmed in a way. \"And what I got, as well as being exciting and dark and sexy and thrilling and all those things, I looked at them both and thought, 'You're both really hurt' and I hadn't seen that before.\" Bartlett - the man behind award-winning play King Charles III, recently filmed by the BBC - says he originally intended Doctor Foster to have a single series. \"But when we were shooting it, I started to realise there could more - there could be another story or a further story to tell,\" he explains. The first series' final scene saw Gemma and her son together, seeing her former husband with his pregnant new partner. \"It looks like a happy ending, but there are lots of threads untied\", Bartlett goes on. \"There's more to tell, so when we had the opportunity, I thought we should.\" Doctor Foster returns to BBC One next month.

{"article": "The exhibition Growing Up in the City at the Museum of Liverpool boasts 25 evocative photographs which capture the life of children over more than 100 years. As well as a providing a snapshot of those lost days of childhood, the pictures also provide a thought-provoking social history of life in Liverpool through the decades. The photographs span the period from the 1880s to the 1990s and illustrate just how much life for a child has changed and also how special occasions were marked on the city's streets. The oldest image dates back to 1887 and is a portrait of Florence, George and Gertie Rollo, who came from Waterloo Park. The Rollo family lived in a large home in the area called Stone House and had four servants. The picture shows the children dressed up in costumes for a fancy dress ball hosted by the Mayor and Mayoress of Bootle, Alderman and Mrs Howard. As well as showing children at play, another image reminds us that many youngsters were also sent out to work. A nervous looking young maid for a well-to-do Liverpool family is captured in a great portrait which is thought to have been taken about 1900.

It comes after The Times reported \"infiltration\" of the contest to replace Ed Miliband by the \"hard left\". Labour says it has a \"robust system\" to prevent \"malicious applications\". Ballot papers have not yet been sent out in the leadership contest, which pits Mr Corbyn against Yvette Cooper, Liz Kendall and Andy Burnham. Labour says the verification process is ongoing, and has refuted claims the leadership contest is being infiltrated by those who do not support the party. Acting leader Harriet Harman emailed MPs this week with a list of new members from their constituencies, asking them to check for any suspicious names. As well as regular members, people can sign up as registered supporters for \u00c2\u00a33 and take part in the vote. They are asked to confirm they \"support the aims and values of the Labour Party\". The Times reported 18 members of Left Unity, a left-wing party founded by film director Ken Loach which fielded 10 candidates at the general election, had registered. At-a-glance profiles of the four contenders . Left Unity principal speaker Salman Shaheen said: \"Left Unity is a party with many disaffected former Labour members. It's no wonder that some people genuinely wanted to have a say in the Labour leadership contest. \"They fully agree with the aims and values of the Labour Party - it's the Labour leadership who abandoned those values.\" Mr Shaheen said it was \"ludicrous\" to refer to its supports as \"entryists\", a term used when members of a political group infiltrate another in order to subvert its policies. \"The surge for Corbyn is a genuine popular movement that the Blairites can't stop,\" Mr Shaheen added. \"It's not about us - they found just 18 Left Unity members out of the tens of thousands who have signed up to support Jeremy Corbyn's anti-austerity, true Labour politics.\" Labour said: \"All applications to join the Labour Party as a member, affiliate or supporter are verified and those who are identified by our verification team as being candidates, members or supporters of another political party will be denied a vote.\" The apparent success of Mr Corbyn's campaign has prompted a row within the party, with other candidates saying a Labour Party led by him could not win an election. But Conservative London mayor Boris Johnson said his party should \"pay attention\" to some of the things said by the Islington North MP, suggesting some of his analysis was \"not wholly wrong\". \"Yes, there is a problem of inequality. Yes, there is a problem of low pay,\" he said during an event in central London.

But the statement added that there remained \"the possibility that additional information will come to light\". An investigation into the death is currently being carried out by Turkish authorities. The statement said the family and the IWPR had carried out an \"extensive review\" of information provided by Turkish authorities. Jenny Sutton said: \"The family is satisfied with the investigation undertaken by the Turkish authorities. \"We were deeply sceptical about initial reports. But based on the evidence we have seen, at this stage we believe that Jacky acted alone.\" The family and the IWPR said the Turkish authorities had provided access to \"the complete dossier of evidence\" relating to the case, including copies of CCTV images from the airport and witness statements. This all indicated that Ms Sutton had been alone and there was no evidence of a struggle, they said. The decision to release information from the investigation had followed \"widespread speculation\" about the circumstances surrounding Ms Sutton's death, the statement added. The IWPR and the family said they would seek a further assessment from an independent investigative expert to confirm the findings once the Turkish investigation was complete.

The report comes a day after the Prison and Probation Service downgraded the Wiltshire prison's rating. The Ministry of Justice said the prison had \"addressed a number of concerns\". The Prison Officers' Association (POA) said management must \"get a grip\". A disturbance at the Category C prison near Devizes last year saw 130 inmates transferred to nearby jails after two wings were put \"out of commission\".

It added tobacco was being smuggled into the prison and sold for about 10 times the price paid in shops and is \"an additional cause of debt, bullying and assault\".

Lead researcher Robert Reisz, a palaeontologist from the University of Toronto Mississauga, in Canada, said: \"We are looking at various stages in the embryonic life of this animal, and we can put this together to get a growth trajectory of the embryo itself - something that has never been done before.\" Reporting the findings in the journal Nature, the international team concluded that the animals would have grown extremely quickly during their incubation period. Short lives . Fossil finds have revealed a wealth of information about the dinosaurs that once roamed the Earth, but little has been known about the very earliest stages of their lives. Three years ago, palaeontologists discovered fragments of fossilised bones in China's Yunnan Province. An analysis revealed that these were the remains of about 20 Lufengosaurus embryos, whose lives were cut short by a flood. Prof Reisz said: \"The nests were inundated by water and basically smothered, and the embryos inside the eggs died and then decayed. \"And then more water activity moved the bones and concentrated them into a very small area. We only excavated 1sq m of the 'bone bed' and we got more than 200 bones.\" The researchers studied the fossils using a variety of techniques, including histology and infrared spectroscopy with a synchrotron in Taiwan. \"The neat thing is that we can get these materials in our hands, we can handle them, cut them, we can look inside the bones - and what we found out is they are growing quite fast, faster than other dinosaurs and faster than a lot of living animals whose embryology we know very well.\" While the researchers cannot establish how long the incubation period was, this finding does suggest that it was short. The team believes the animals emerged well developed and might have continued to develop quickly. Professor Reisz said: \"We are hypothesising if this very fast growth rate we see in the embryos was maintained in the hatchlings and the juveniles, then we have a very fast growth rate in the initial stages of the life of this animal.\" The Lufengosaurus belongs to a group of dinosaurs called the sauropodomorphs, and is a predecessor of the sauropod, a true giant of the dinosaur world that could grow up to 60m (200ft) in length.

Ashford Borough Council removed all its Kingdom officers from patrolling the streets, after one was filmed revealing he raked in a bonus of almost \u00a31,000. They will be out of action while undergoing extra training. A spokeswoman for the council said: \"In light of the recent Panorama programme we have decided to take this opportunity to give our wardens some important additional staff training exercises so they can continue operating fairly and effectively. \"We haven't suspended them but they are not patrolling currently. They should be back soon, after the training has been undertaken.\" Littering is a crime, but by paying the fine you can avoid a criminal record. Another Kent-based Kingdom trainer was caught on camera saying they pretend to call the police to pressure people to pay up. The BBC1 programme, aired on Monday, revealed people across the country were wrongly fined for tipping coffee down a drain and putting their recycling out on the wrong day. On Tuesday Maidstone Borough Council also removed its own Kingdom officers while a review was carried out. They were back patrolling on Wednesday. It is not the first time councils in Kent have had problems with Kingdom. Maidstone suspended its officers last year for a two-week review after a woman was incorrectly fined for littering while feeding some ducks. Gravesham Borough Council severed ties with Kingdom last year and now operates its litter enforcement \"in-house\".

{"article": "Customers who pay via direct debit often receive bills based on estimated meter readings. When an actual reading is taken, the company \"back-bills\" the customer for any shortfall between payments and the energy used. Citizens Advice says that the bills hit thousands of pounds in some cases. Its research last year showed that as many as 2.1 million consumers a year receive some sort of catch up bill, at an average of \u00c2\u00a3206. In 2007, energy suppliers signed a voluntary commitment promising not to back-bill domestic customers for energy used more than 12 months previously, if the supplier was at fault. The expansion of the market has led to concerns that some are not keeping to this agreement, and regulator Ofgem wants to write it into the rules by the winter. \"We expect suppliers to put their customers first, which is why we are proposing a new enforceable rule to provide this protection,\" said Rachel Fletcher, senior partner at Ofgem. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \"Shock gas and electricity bills can throw people's finances into disarray. \"We helped one person who received a bill for over \u00c2\u00a33,000 after their energy company stopped taking their direct debit payment but didn't tell the customer.
