The company said it would invest \u00c2\u00a37m at its manufacturing sites in Edinburgh and Llantarnam, South Wales. It also plans to consolidate its Knowlsey multi-site distribution operations in a single location. Burton's Foods intends to phase down production from March before completing the closure later in 2011. Chief executive Ben Clarke said: \"Today's announcements recognise the need to transform our supply chain. \"The proposed job losses are deeply regrettable, but, along with the new \u00c2\u00a325m investment we are making in our UK manufacturing capability, will help deliver sustainable profitable growth for the company in a highly competitive and challenging market.\" Angela Eagle, Labour MP for Wallasey, said it was a \"huge blow to the community\". \"This is the largest private sector employer in the constituency and they have decided to close this plant at a time when the job market is deeply depressed, leaving 342 families struggling after Christmas. \"I will pledge to work during the consultation to persuade them to change this decision.\" She added: \"Over the years we have given endless support to the plant, injecting public money to keep it going and secure those jobs, and it is a devastating blow that they turn around today and do this to Morton.\" Wirral Council leader Councillor Jeff Green said: \"I am incredibly disappointed by this proposal and will be seeking an urgent meeting with Burton's to examine and discuss the reason behind their decision. \"I also wish to investigate whatever opportunities there are to continue to work with the company to secure jobs in Wirral and the future of the site.\" The Unite union's national officer Jennie Formby said: \"Burton's has been part of the Wirral for generations, providing stable employment for families across the community. \"So we will fight with all our power to save this plant because closure is not an option.

{"article": "Woolf Works - based both on her life and the novels Orlando, The Waves and Mrs Dalloway - will premiere in summer 2015, choreographed by Wayne McGregor. McGregor told the BBC the piece would \"break the rules\" of narrative ballet. The season will also include new works by Hofesh Shechter and Philip Glass, whose chamber opera The Trial is based on the Kafka novel of the same name. The Czech author's original story tells of Josef K, who is arrested and tried for a crime without ever being told what the charges against him are. Glass, who has worked with Music Theatre Wales on the piece, said: \"I think of my pocket operas as neutron bombs - small, but packing a terrific punch\". McGregor, who is the Royal Ballet's resident choreographer, said he had been inspired to apply Virginia Woolf's narrative style to full-length ballet. \"Her writing lends itself to the breaking of rules, in terms of how words are organised, or thoughts are organised. I thought that was a perfect filter to create something new.\" \"We're going to be able to find a way of mashing up, splicing and going back-and-forward through periods of time in a way that will hopefully be really evocative, and a different way of experiencing ballet\". Israeli choreographer Shechter is described by the ROH as \"one of the UK's most exciting contemporary artists\". However, The Guardian's dance critic, Judith Mackrell, has suggested his choreography is \"the physical and aesthetic opposite of the Royal's classical style\". The first collaboration between the two will be unveiled as part of a triple bill in March 2015. Other highlights include an evening of works by Frederick Ashton, founder choreographer of The Royal Ballet. The programme will feature Scenes de ballet, Ashton's own personal favourite amongst his works; Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan; A Month in the Country and Symphonic Variations, which he created for his muse Margot Fonteyn. Carlos Acosta's Don Quixote will be revived, while the Christmas production will be Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, which will also be screened live in cinemas on 16 December. Manon, one of the company's signature ballets, will open the season, marking the 40th anniversary of Kenneth MacMillan's original production. \"Manon is a firm favourite with audiences and, I have to say, the dancers,\" said Royal Opera House director Kevin O'Hare. \"Every ballerina would love to be Manon, so we have a huge range of dancers portraying that role.\" Female choreographers' works are appearing at the venue's second, smaller venue, The Linbury, where Kate Prince, Kristen McNally and Shobana Jeyasingh will all premiere new works. The opera programme includes Placido Domingo in Verdi's I due Foscari, as well as Stephen Gould and Nina Stemme taking the title roles in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde. At a press launch for the new season, one reporter challenged the institution over the programme, noting that almost half of the performances stemmed from three composers - Verdi, Puccini and Rossini. \"It's true,\" said Kasper Holten, the Director of Opera at ROH. \"But we have to acknowledge the fact that there is a big demand out there for certain composers.\" \"We offer works by all kinds of composers [but] in order to make our business model work, with the cuts you all know have happened... we have to think of the market.\" \"For me, as long as we get the mix of titles right, then having to be savvy about the number of performances we do of each title, that is, for me, a fair way to do it.\"", "abstract": "A ballet inspired by Virginia Woolf will be the centrepiece of the 2014/15 season at the Royal Opera House.", "candidate": "The Royal Ballet is to premiere a new work inspired by the writings of Virginia Woolf.", "doc_id": 1891, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "McGregor, who is the Royal Ballet's resident choreographer, said he had been inspired to apply Virginia Woolf's narrative style to full-length ballet.", "explanation": "it correctly pulls the info (the ballet, the inspiration for the work) from the source text", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

{"article": "A court hearing to decide how long Ciar\u00e1n Maxwell will serve in prison is under way at the Old Bailey. In February, Maxwell, 31, admitted a number of offences, including bomb-making and storing stolen military weapons. The County Antrim man also pleaded guilty to drugs and fraud charges. The hearing is expected to take up to three days. Maxwell is not in court, but is appearing via video link from Woodhill Prison in Milton Keynes. According to the charge details, he had a stash of explosives in 12 purpose-built hides in England and Northern Ireland. DNA evidence found at one of the County Antrim hides led to Maxwell's arrest. On Wednesday, the court heard that Maxwell told police he had taken a member of the Continuity IRA to a hide where he had stashed pipe bombs in Northern Ireland. The court was told the man he took to the hide was Niall Lehd, convicted in 2014 of possession of an explosive substance with intent to endanger life. Maxwell, who is originally from Larne, had handwritten \"to-do lists\" mentioning \"targets, dummy runs and recces\" and a number of towns in Northern Ireland. The exact details were redacted by the court, but the targets included a Territorial Army centre and substations. There was also reference to a loyalist group, the need to notify news agencies and the words \"test pipe bomb and car bomb\". In one of his hides, Maxwell placed a modified booby-trapped torch which, when armed, would explode if turned on. Maxwell lived in Exminster, County Devon, and was based with 40 Commando in Taunton, Somerset. He never served in Northern Ireland. He was arrested last August and a search near Exeter found hides with a range of explosive substances, as well as ammunition, weapons and tools for making bombs. Along with the 14 pipe bombs, the court heard Maxwell also stashed: . On Wednesday, prosecutor Richard Whittam QC told the court: \"Across 14 of the locations involved in the investigation, Mr Maxwell had in his possession, or had constructed, 14 pipe bombs... four have been deployed in Northern Ireland. \"It is our case that some of the items inevitably must have been taken from the UK to Northern Ireland by this defendant.\" He added: \"It may be that, when travelling between England and the UK, bearing in mind the identity cards he would have had, and his position, his passage would have been easier than others to take items with him.\" The court heard dissident republicans have carried out more than 160 terrorist attacks since 2010, including the deployment of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) such as pipe bombs. Mr Whittam said: \"Whilst attacks are mainly directed at members of the police, military and prison service, the nature of the attacks leaves members of the public at risk.\" The court heard that Maxwell \"appeared shocked\" when he was arrested. After his arrest, drugs were found in locker at the camp, including herbal cannabis, cannabis resin, and hallucinogenic drugs DMT and LSD. In March 2016, police said bomb-making parts had been found in barrels hidden in a wooded area in Carnfunnock County Park in County Antrim. Two months later, another \"terrorist hide\" was found in Capanagh Forest, also near Larne. Police described it as one of the most significant arms finds in recent years.

{"article": "Conciliation service Acas confirmed talks had ended for the day and would continue on Friday. The RMT told its members to return to work on Wednesday evening as Southern had \"agreed to meet.. without the caveat of any preconditions\". Southern said it had arranged some trains on previously closed routes. Reinstated trains included extra services to Eastbourne, where a four-day air show is being held. The train operator had warned it was too late to replace the strike timetable on Thursday but said it had arranged additional trains on previously closed routes, including Horsham to Dorking, Eastbourne to Ashford International and Littlehampton to Portsmouth & Southsea. An amended timetable will be in place on Friday, Southern posted on its website. Nearly 1,000 services across the Southern network were cancelled on each strike day this week. The disagreement centres on proposals by Southern operator Govia Thameslink (GTR) to turn conductors into \"on-board supervisors\", with drivers taking over responsibility for opening and closing carriage doors. In a letter to RMT general secretary Mick Cash on Monday, GTR warned \"change is happening\". It said: \"Our plans to implement the new role will commence on 21 August... the window for you to reach agreement with us is closing.\" Southern has said it wants the RMT to agree to a list of \"exceptional circumstances\" when a train could be dispatched from stations with only one member of staff on board. The union argues guards help prevent passengers becoming trapped in train doors. But the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB) said there could be potential safety benefits from \"the removal of any possible miscommunication, which could exist between driver and guard\". The RSSB said it had analysed safety data and found \"no increased risk of harm to passengers\" where drivers operate powered doors and follow correct procedures. In June Mr Cash said the RSSB was funded by the train companies and it was \"ludicrous\" to regard it as independent. He said previous RSSB studies questioned the safety of driver-only trains. Seafront businesses in Sussex have blamed the long-running Southern train dispute for a downturn in tourist trade. Brighton Pier estimated visitor numbers were down 10% to 30% on last year. Its managing director Anne Martin told the BBC she believed visitors were reluctant to travel on trains they could not rely on. Adam Chinnery of the Seafront Business Association in Brighton warned that traders could not afford to miss income in the summer holiday season.

In a statement the European Parliament Bureau said: \"The activities of the ADDE which were found to breach the rules for European party financing, were nine opinion polls held in the UK ahead of the 2015 general elections as well as ahead of the EU referendum in 2016, and a report on these polls. \"The expenditure linked to the services of three consultants was considered non-eligible by an external auditor and by the Parliament's administration.\" When the European Parliament allegations first emerged last week, a spokesman for the ADDE group accused the parliament of \"harassment\", with UKIP MEP Roger Helmer adding: \"Call it revenge for Brexit if you like.\" BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said it was understood the Electoral Commission inquiry related to whether UKIP spent some of the European money on the Brexit referendum. UKIP would face a possible fine up to \u00c2\u00a320,000 if it was judged to have accepted \"impermissible donations\".", "abstract": "The Electoral Commission has opened an investigation into UKIP's finances after allegations it misspent EU funds.", "candidate": "The UK's election watchdog is investigating whether UKIP broke the law in using European Union funds.", "doc_id": 2310, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "The UK's election watchdog is investigating whether UKIP broke the law in using European Union funds.", "evidence": "\"The activities of the ADDE which were found to breach the rules for European party financing, were nine opinion polls held in the UK ahead of the 2015 general elections as well as ahead of the EU referendum in 2016, and a report on these polls.", "explanation": "The source text supports that there is an investigation and it is common terminology and therfore resonable to call an overseer a \"watchdog\" and it is envolved in the \"UK\" and with \"elections\", also the source supports the fundsd were from a European business fund which is referenced as EU, so it is resonable to say \"European Union\" funds.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

At a hearing in the Central American country on Monday, a court ruled the case against Dr Alejandro Guidos should proceed and ruled that he could not leave the country.

{"article": "Mr Baran thought up the idea of making communication networks resilient to attack or traffic surges by splitting the data sent over them into chunks. His pioneering work was carried out in connection with Cold War military research. It would later form the basis of the academic network Arpanet which eventually led to the internet. Mr Baran first put forward the idea of slicing data into \"message blocks\" and using a distributed system of nodes to pass them on when working at the Rand Corporation in the mid-1960s. In his initial conception, Mr Baran said the system would operate by what he called \"hot-potato routing\". The work was done as part of a project to keep telecommunications networks operating even if a large part of them was knocked out by a first strike nuclear attack. The system would be better able to withstand an attack because it lacked a central hub through which all data or messages passed. This work found new relevance during the early days of the Arpanet, a network designed to aid US scientists communicate and which laid the foundations of the modern-day internet. Contributions from British scientist Donald Davies led to Mr Baran's ideas being adapted into a technology known as packet switching. This cuts data up into small chunks that are then despatched around the network. \"Paul wasn't afraid to go in directions counter to what everyone else thought was the right or only thing to do,\" Vinton Cerf, one of the fathers of the internet and a longtime friend of Baran, told the New York Times.

The 18-year-old was described by Justice Minister Michael Keenan as \"a known terror suspect who was a person of interest to law enforcement and intelligence agencies\". Police said the meeting at the Endeavour Hills police station was prompted by an escalation of activity that had led to concern. Mr Abbott, who is overseas, said the incident showed \"that there are people in our community who are capable of very extreme acts\". The incident came days after police conducted major anti-terror raids in Sydney and Brisbane in response to an alleged plot by IS followers to publicly behead a randomly-selected Australian. One man has been charged with serious terrorism offences following that operation. In recent months, Australian officials have been expressing growing concern over the the impact of Australians fighting with Islamist groups in the Middle East on domestic security. They are concerned both about returnees and those who sympathise with the causes they advocate.

{"article": "Spotify, Apple Music, Google Play, Tidal and Amazon Prime Music are among nine services that will offer the band's tracks worldwide. The group split up in April 1970. However, their songs - including Hey Jude and Yesterday - remain hugely popular and influential. One expert suggested that the move would help their legacy endure. \"In terms of digital the Beatles have always been quite late to the party - they came to iTunes in 2010, which was a good five years after the iTunes Music Store started gaining momentum,\" said Chris Cooke, co-founder of the music industry news site CMU. \"We had expected they would probably do an exclusive deal to stream their music with one service, but it looks like instead they are going to be pretty much everywhere from day one. \"So, I suppose that is them accepting that streaming is now a very serious, significant part of the record industry.\" Other services that have secured the band's catalogue include Deezer, Microsoft Groove, Napster and Slacker Radio. The deal involves rights to stream 224 songs from the original 13 studio albums released in the UK as well as \"essential\" collections including Past Masters. The tracks will be made available from 24 December. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr clocked up 17 number one singles in the British charts as the Beatles. But long after the band broke up they continued to issue songs and compilations, the most recent of which was an expanded edition of Beatles 1 put on sale last month. \"There's a really simply reason why the Beatles catalogue took so long to join streaming services - their publishers didn't want to do anything to damage potential sales of reissues and retrospectives - it's a very lucrative catalogue,\" said Mark Mulligan from the media research firm Midia. \"But they've waited until the market has got some scale and they could get the best deal. \"It's a big PR catch as it helps communicate that the platforms are 'all the music in the world' - which is the value proposition of streaming services.\" Analysis - Mark Savage, BBC Music reporter . It's a White (Album) Christmas. Some of the most enduring hits in pop are coming to a streaming service near you. The Beatles as a corporate entity have been notoriously slow in adapting to new technology. They waited five years to issue their albums on CD, and didn't talk about the download Revolution until 2010 - seven years after the iTunes store launched. Their arrival on streaming services comes as consumption on those platforms starts to overtake digital downloads as a source of income for the music industry. The number of songs streamed in the UK looks set to top 25 billion this year, up from 13.7 billion in 2014, according to the Official Charts Company. It will be interesting to see how the band's music competes against the likes of Justin Bieber - whose latest singles are being streamed almost six million times a week, exerting a firm grip on the top of the charts. When The Beatles became available to buy on iTunes, the band scored 10 entries into the Top 100 - but the top-selling song (Hey Jude) only reached number 40. The Beatles announcement comes as a number of high-profile artists - including Neil Young, Prince and Radiohead's Thom Yorke - have questioned the value of streaming services. The most prominent example is Adele. Her new album, 25, has sold more than seven million copies without appearing on any streaming platform, although she has made her single Hello available. \"I believe music should be an event,\" she told Time magazine earlier this week. \"I don't use streaming. I buy my music. I download it, and I buy a physical [copy] just to make up for the fact that someone else somewhere isn't. \"It's a bit disposable, streaming.\"", "abstract": "The Beatles' music is being made available on a wide range of streaming music services.", "candidate": "The Beatles are to make their music available on streaming services for the first time.", "doc_id": 3103, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "The Beatles are to make their music available on several streaming services for the first time.", "evidence": "\"We had expected they would probably do an exclusive deal to stream their music with one service, but it looks like instead they are going to be pretty much everywhere from day one.", "explanation": "it makes up that this is the first time ever they're on streaming services", "instruction": "Remove the information about this being the first time ever they're on streaming services from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about this being the first time ever they're on streaming services from the summary."]}}

{"article": "Barking and Dagenham Council could ask Robert Clack School to expand to a 16-form entry system in an effort to cope with rising pupil numbers. The borough is one of 11 London councils that face big increases in demand for secondary school places. The country's biggest post-11 school is currently Ashfield Comprehensive in Nottinghamshire, with 2,492 pupils. Robert Clack is an oversubscribed mixed comprehensive in Dagenham which specialises in science. It currently has around 1,900 students. Barking and Dagenham has experienced the biggest growth in London in the number of children aged up to four. \"By 2020, we will need around 30-35 more forms of entry,\" said a council spokeswoman. She said adding just two or three forms could overburden a school, but adding six would allow it to build more classrooms and facilities. She added: \"These proposals are being discussed with schools and no decisions have been taken. This is an option available to more than one school.\" A report by London Councils earlier this month predicted London would need an additional 78,000 secondary places by 2020. According to the report, the cost of creating new school places means the capital faces a \u00c2\u00a31.5bn funding shortfall over the next five years. Councils must either expand existing schools, build new ones or rely on free schools - which are outside their control - to meet the demand. The deputy leader of Lambeth Council, Imogen Walker, said it was difficult to plan extra provision. \"With the uncertainty over where free schools are going to open in the borough it is difficult to forecast places available,\" said Cllr Walker. \"Lambeth's overall projections indicate that there could be some 700 [additional] places required by 2020/21 .\" The London borough of Greenwich is opening three new secondary schools over the next two years to cope with demand.

{"article": "Many clubs are facing a major financial crisis and have not paid salaries for several months. The footballers' union says the strike will go on until the players received what they are owed. The strike involves players of more than 200 Argentine clubs. The two matches postponed were Rosario Central v Godoy Cruz, in the city of Rosario, and San Lorenzo v Belgrano, in Buenos Aires. The crisis began after senior officials at the Football Association (AFA) were implicated in a corruption scandal involving television broadcasting rights. The season should have resumed a month ago after the summer recess. But the crisis led the AFA to delay the start until this Friday. To try to avoid the strike, the government of Mauricio Macri made a $22m (\u00c2\u00a318m) payment on Thursday to the Argentine Football Association. The money was owed as compensation for the cancellation of a contract with the government, which held the broadcasting rights until this year. But the players' union says the money is not enough. They said most club presidents had spent and borrowed more money than they should have. The death in 2014 of Julio Grondona, who was president of the Argentine Football Association for 35 years, triggered the crisis. He was also vice-president of Fifa, the world football's governing body. The United States authorities who investigated corruption at Fifa labelled Mr Grondona \"the number one conspirator\".

He won his 10th titles at Monte Carlo and Barcelona as well as his 30th Masters title in Madrid. \"It is the biggest challenge in the game to beat Nadal over five sets on clay in Paris,\" Henman told BBC Sport.

The Scottish government said the railway had proved a huge success and expected more investment in future. Reform Scotland released written evidence it had sent to Transport Scotland's rail infrastructure strategy consultation. It has been submitted on its behalf by advisory board member Tom Harris, a former Labour transport minister in the UK government. He makes a range of suggestions including the need for \"bigger thinking\" in the long-term vision for Scotland's railways. Mr Harris singled out the Borders Railway for criticism with the construction of bridges to accommodate only single-track width as an example of limits placed on future expansion. He said: \"We are in danger of missing the bigger picture when it comes to discussing rail in Scotland. \"We talk in very narrow terms about ScotRail and its operation, but what we actually need is an injection of some creative, strategic thinking so that we can give the Scottish people a rail system built for the future and one to be proud of. \" He called for the creation of a Scottish Rail Infrastructure Commission to examine what \"ambitious transformational projects and new railway lines\" were needed to boost the Scottish economy and \"transform our connectivity as a nation\". \"The Borders Railway showed us that there is an appetite for new railways in Scotland, but it also showed us that our thinking is too small and our planning too short-term,\" he said. \"That ship has now sailed, but we must learn the lessons from it, think big, and plan long, and that is why the need for a commission is now critical.\" A Scottish government spokesman said it welcomed Reform Scotland's comments. \"The think-tank has raised issues about structure and vision,\" he said. \"Whilst there will be different views on structures to realise the vision for Scotland's railways it is clear that the ambitions for our railway to be a driver of economic growth and a positive, integral part of our social fabric is an ambition that is shared right across Scotland.\" He said the reopening of the Borders Railway had been a \"cause for celebration\" in the Borders and Midlothian. \"We were always confident that, in time, it would deliver major economic opportunities and attract new investment, so it is pleasing to see strong evidence that visits and spending are up significantly as a direct result of the new railway,\" he said. \"With over 1.2m passenger journeys in its first year alone, additional seats on peak time services and more improvements and initiatives in the pipeline, we look forward to seeing even more investment and interest in the area in the months and years ahead.\"", "abstract": "The Scottish government has defended the Borders Railway after claims the infrastructure vision for the project was \"short-sighted\".", "candidate": "The reopening of the Borders Railway last year has led to calls for a commission to examine the future of Scotland's railways.", "doc_id": 1270, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "He called for the creation of a Scottish Rail Infrastructure Commission to examine what \"ambitious transformational projects and new railway lines\" were needed to boost the Scottish economy and \"transform our connectivity as a nation\".", "explanation": "it correctly pulls all the info (the opening, the calls to make the commission) from the source text", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

{"article": "Several Australian bars have dumped Coopers Brewery after it was featured by religious group the Bible Society. The video shows two MPs debating their opposing views on same-sex marriage - which is not legal in Australia - as they clutch Coopers beers. It has led to claims Coopers is against marriage equality, a claim it denies. The backlash has gathered pace in recent days and, by Tuesday, a string of drinking spots in favour of same-sex marriage had boycotted the brand. The Bible Society posted the \"Keeping It Light\" video on Thursday. It features conservative MPs Tim Wilson (for same-sex marriage) and Andrew Hastie (against) debating the issue in what they call a \"civil and respectful way\". Coopers has since claimed it \"did not give permission\" to be included in the video. However, the brand recently celebrated the Bible Society's 200-year anniversary with a commemorative beer featuring Bible verses. In the video, Mr Wilson argues: \"I believe that it would be sensible to change the act that deals with issues around civil marriage to include two people regardless of their gender.\" Mr Hastie counters: \"I'm for retaining the current definition of marriage, which is between a man and a woman.\" Despite Mr Wilson's inclusion, critics interpreted the video as one-sided. One commentator said Coopers risked sponsoring a \"political act by a religious organisation\", while another said \"homophobia lite is still homophobia\". \"I have respected Coopers all my life, and it was crushing to realise that as a queer person, they don't respect me,\" wrote Chloe Sargeant for the Special Broadcasting Service. Opposition to the video has picked up steam since the weekend. By Tuesday, at least eight drinking spots in Sydney and Melbourne had publicly declared they would not stock Coopers. One widely shared video showed two people throwing full bottles in the bin. Luke Hiscox, from Sydney's Union Hotel, which plans to take Coopers off tap, said people were upset by the phrase \"keeping it light\". \"That irks people because for them it's not in the slightest a light topic,\" he told the BBC. \"I don't think they really realised what they were saying.\" Another venue, The Old Bar in Melbourne, said it would boycott Coopers because it was \"very obvious that our values are at odds\". In a statement, Cooper said it was not \"trying to push a religious message\" with its commemorative beer range. It maintained it had not sponsored the video. \"We respect the beliefs of our community and do not wish to try and change them,\" the company said. In a subsequent statement, it said it had cancelled the release of its Bible Society commemorative cans and would be joining Australian Marriage Equality. \"\"Our company supports marriage equality,\" Director of Corporate Affairs Melanie Cooper said. Bible Society chief executive Greg Clarke said the video sought to have a \"civil conversation on a serious issue\". \"At first I was surprised the reaction was so immediate and extreme, but then on reflection [I] wasn't surprised because this really seems to be how social media works at the moment,\" he told the BBC. Mr Wilson has described the boycott as absurd, saying it only proves the value of the discussion. \"I'm disappointed Coopers appears to have distanced themselves from a sensible conversation that they should be proud to align themselves with,\" he told news.com.au. Advertising commentator Jane Caro agreed the video was not promoting a view. She said same-sex marriage advocates were often suspicious of religious messaging. \"They have lost patience and lost tolerance for the idea that there should be mutual respect on both sides,\" Ms Caro told the BBC. \"I think Coopers have probably inadvertently found themselves in the eye of the storm.\"", "abstract": "Australia's largest independent beer company has found itself at the centre of a boycott over a video discussing same-sex marriage.", "candidate": "A popular Australian beer brand is facing a backlash over a controversial video on same-sex marriage.", "doc_id": 2921, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "An Australian beer brand is facing a backlash over a controversial video on same-sex marriage", "evidence": "Several Australian bars have dumped Coopers Brewery after it was featured by religious group the Bible Society.", "explanation": "it makes up that the beer brand is popular", "instruction": "Remove the information about the brand being popular from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about the brand being popular from the summary."]}}

He also said UKIP voters were \"darkly pessimistic\" about their lives, whereas progressive politics was optimistic.

Official figures published in August showed UK net migration - the difference between those entering and leaving - increased by more than 38% to 243,000 in 2013-14.

{"article": "The Foreign Office announcement comes one year after the reopening of the British Embassy in Tehran. \"This is an important moment in the relationship between the UK and Iran,\" Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said. Nicholas Hopton, a former British ambassador to Qatar and Yemen, will take up the role of ambassador. The British embassy in Tehran was closed after it was stormed and ransacked by protesters in November 2011. The embassy was reopened in August 2015 by then-British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and the two countries resumed ties on Charge d'Affaires level. \"The upgrade in diplomatic relations gives us the opportunity to develop our discussions on a range of issues, including our consular cases about which I am deeply concerned,\" Boris Johnson said in a statement. \"I hope this will mark the start of more productive co-operation between our countries, enabling us to discuss more directly issues such as human rights and Iran's role in the region.\" Mr Hopton joined the Foreign & Commonwealth Office in 1989 and was the British ambassador to Qatar from 2013 to 2015. He also served as the British ambassador to Yemen and at the British Embassies in Paris, Rome and Rabat. By Caroline Hawley, BBC diplomatic correspondent . Ever since the Islamic Revolution of 1979, the relationship between Iran and Britain has been rocky, to say the least. It hit a low five years ago, when protesters tore down the flag at the British embassy and ripped up pictures of the Queen after Iran's parliament voted to expel the British ambassador. Today's upgrading of ties - which amounts to the full restoration of diplomatic relations - is symbolically important. It is the culmination of months of steady improvement following last year's nuclear deal. The lifting of sanctions has created new business opportunities for Britain, but politically there will, no doubt, be bumps in the road ahead. London and Tehran don't see eye to eye on Iran's role in the wider Middle East or on human rights, and the continuing detention of dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe - arrested by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in April - remains a source of great concern to Britain. The development follows the arrest of at least six people with dual nationality who are being held in Iran for alleged security offences. One of them, British-Iranian charity worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, was arrested in Tehran in April while she was trying to return to the UK after a holiday with her two-year-old daughter Gabriella. Iran does not recognise dual nationality, and does not allow consular access to those who are being held. Prime Minister Theresa May spoke with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani about the cases over the telephone last month.

The building is meant to be demolished as part of preparations for next year's World Cup. Community leaders said they were ready to fight back with bows and arrows. Campaigners say the eviction and demolition of the historic building - Rio's former indigenous museum, built in 1862 - are unnecessary. The community, known as Aldeia Maracana (or Maracana tribe), settled in the disused building six years ago. 'Tourist attraction' Brazilian authorities say the area needs to be cleared for the circulation of fans during the 2014 World Cup. Rio's governor Sergio Cabral recently said the demolition was being demanded by the Fifa, the international football federation. But Fifa's office in Brazil issued a letter denying the claim, says the BBC's Julia Carneiro in Rio. There are plans to build a car park in the area. A nearby state school is also due to be demolished, despite protests by parents. Several matches will be played in Brazil's biggest and most famous stadium, including the World Cup final. When it reopens, in the next few months, it will have a total capacity of 78,000 spectators. Maracana will also host the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2016 Olympics. The old Indigenous Museum, which belongs to the federal government, is in urgent need of repair. More than 20 families live there, planting traditional herbs and tobacco. Campaign groups have tried to save it and keep the indigenous community where it has lived for the past six years. The community hoped to be able to showcase their way of life to tourists during the World Cup. Opposition legislator at the Rio de Janeiro Assembly Marcelo Freixo said tourists \"would rather see a historic building next to the stadium than a car park or fast food joint\".

{"article": "Two years ago, that border comprised two parallel dirt tracks, one on the Bulgarian, one on the Turkish side. Now a razor-wire fence, 1.5m (5ft) thick, welcomes would-be migrants. Thirty kilometres is already completed, while 100km more remains under construction. \"The purpose of the fence,\" says Philip Gunev, deputy interior minister, \"is to divert flows of migrants towards border crossing points where our limited financial resources allow us to protect European borders in a more efficient way\". Such official checkpoints, he insists, are safer for asylum seekers than trudging long distances, often with small children, over the rough, hilly terrain the fence now cuts across. Fixed and mobile cameras, mounted on four-by-four vehicles, complete the picture along the whole length of the border. In the past eight years, since joining the European Union, Bulgaria has spent \u20ac300m (\u00a3215m) of mostly EU money, reinforcing this border. Another \u20ac100m is available to complete the job until 2020. Only \u20ac2m will be received for the better integration of refugees in the same period. Krassimir Kanev, director of the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights advocacy groups, is unhappy with the checkpoints. \"The only way to get through is to pay smugglers,\" he says, arguing that only the richer migrants get a chance to try. \"And there's nothing safe about being cramped in the hidden compartment of a truck in the heat of summer.\" About one third of Bulgaria's migrants are caught on the border with Turkey, another third as they head north or west inside Bulgaria, and the rest on the Serbian or Romanian borders, as they try to continue their journey towards Hungary on their way to Germany. Bulgaria has one of the highest rates of granting refugee status in the EU. Refugee status means they also receive a Convention Travel Document (CTD) and under the 1951 Refugee Convention they can travel on to anywhere in the EU and stay for up to 90 days. In practice, few ever come back, travelling to Germany or elsewhere. At the Harmanli refugee camp in south-eastern Bulgaria, two police buses bring more asylum seekers. Children wave happily, adults look more concerned. Conditions here are much better than they were in 2013, when overcrowding, appalling sanitary conditions, and the alleged cruelty of guards gave Bulgaria a bad name. Some asylum seekers still express frustration at delays with their applications. A group of men hold up a snake they killed in the camp the day before. But most acknowledge a big improvement in conditions for the 1,600 refugees here. Bulgaria is facing growing pressure from Western governments to identify exactly who they do let in. Ninety percent arrive with no documents whatsoever because they were taken by the smugglers who brought them this far. In an upstairs room at Harmanli, officers from the Bulgarian intelligence services cross-examine the refugees, most of whom are Syrian Kurds. While Harmanli is an open camp, those deemed suspect are taken to a prison at Busmantsi, near Sofia, where they can be detained for up to a year, while more investigations are carried out. \"The most frustrating thing about life there was the waiting,\" said one former Busmantsi inmate, who asked not to be named. \"Your whole life is waiting. You know there will be an end to all this, and one day you will be out, but at this moment you have nothing to do but wait.\" Are there radical Islamists inside the prison? I ask. \"People keep themselves to themselves. They only share what they have to,\" he tells me. \"But the radical mood among my friends is all about money, which comes mostly from Saudi Arabia. It has nothing to do with political or religious beliefs.\" \"Don't link those fleeing terror with those who would like to create it,\" says Boris Cheshirkov, a UN refugee agency spokesman in Bulgaria. \"States can protect refugees, and address security concerns too, by screening and registering them early on.\"", "abstract": "In the control room of the Bulgarian border police at Elhovo, set back from the country's 270km (165 mile) long border with Turkey, officers control banks of CCTV screens.", "candidate": "Bulgaria is building a fence along its border with Turkey to stem the flow of migrants and refugees.", "doc_id": 3677, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "Bulgaria is building a fence along its border with Turkey to divert migrants and refugees to official border crossing points.", "evidence": "\"The purpose of the fence,\" says Philip Gunev, deputy interior minister, \"is to divert flows of migrants towards border crossing points where our limited financial resources allow us to protect European borders in a more efficient way\".", "explanation": "The summary says the purpose of the fence is to stem the flow of migrants.

In a statement, it expressed its regret that the issue had not been resolved in a more \"timely manner\". \"Unfortunately, an administrative input error received by the Secret Service was not able to be rectified promptly,\" the statement added. Mr Adams had been invited to the annual shamrock ceremony which was hosted by President Obama. He said he was subjected to \"unacceptable and unprofessional\" treatment. As he tried to check in to the event, he was told a security issue had arisen. His party colleagues, Martin McGuinness and Mary-Lou McDonald had already entered the celebrations. \"He (Mr Adams) stood to one side and he waited around, he waited around and he waited for something like between 80 and 90 minutes,\" said BBC News NI economics editor, John Campbell, who is covering events in Washington. \"By that stage I think people inside the room texted him to say President Obama had started speaking and at that point Gerry Adams decided that, well, he was going to leave. \"He wasn't technically refused entry but he was left hanging around for the best part of an hour and a half and then decided it wasn't worth his while staying any more, so he left.\" Mr Adams said that he had been invited to the event and was \"pleased to accept\". \"When I arrived the staff at the White House informed me there was an issue of 'security',\" he said. \"After two decades of travelling back and forth to the USA and countless meetings in the White House with successive US Presidents, this is an unacceptable development. \"It is obvious that there remain some within the US administration who seek to treat Sinn F\u00e9in differently.\" Mr Adams added that Sinn F\u00e9in representatives had been denied entry or had to go through extra searches when travelling to the USA, while the State Department had also initially refused to meet him last year until \"protest from US political leaders\". \"Sinn F\u00e9in will not sit at the back of the bus for anyone,\" he said. \"I am hopeful that the controversy around my White House invitation will help lead to a resolution to all these matters.\" Mr Adams told the BBC that Sinn F\u00e9in representatives often face enhanced security checks but they normally do not \"broadcast\" it.

{"article": "Many commentators condemn the police action against the Zaman newspaper and Samanyolu TV channel as a clampdown on press freedom. Both are described as being close to Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, the spiritual leader of the Hizmet movement, whom Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accuses of running a \"parallel state\". Pro-government newspapers, however, defend the authorities' action. \"Hitler also started like this,\" says opposition leftist daily Taraf. \"A strike against democracy,\" exclaims pro-Gulen newspaper Bugun. \"A raid meant to silence,\" declares Cumhuriyet. A commentary in the secular daily states that the administration led by President Erdogan \"doesn't like anything that is associated with freedom of the press\". \"It is indisputable that this operation is aimed at strengthening RTE's [Recep Tayyip Erdogan's] authoritarianism and dictatorship,\" says the article. \"Opposing the raid against Zaman and Samanyolu TV and the detentions does not mean defending their [the Gulen community's] opinions, beliefs and activities. What is at stake here is the freedom of press,\" argues centre-left daily Radikal. Zaman, the moderate, pro-Islamic and pro-Gulen daily whose editor in-chief Ekrem Dumanli was detained by the police, has replaced its blue and white masthead with black lettering. \"Dark day for democracy,\" says the paper's headline. Zaman also runs an article by Mr Dumanli in which he condemns those \"who want to turn the country into a spy state and a republic of fear, and want to govern it as if it was their own private fiefdom\". \"We have a duty to make sure this won't be the case,\" writes the arrested journalist. Turkish TV also aired criticism of the arrests. Privately-owned NTV and CNN-Turk showed footage of protesters in front of Zaman's headquarters in Istanbul, holding posters saying, ''We all need free press'' and ''Free media cannot be silenced.\" CNN Turk and NTV broadcast critical statements from Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP). He condemned the police action as a \"coup\". Mr Kilicdaroglu was also seen on state TRT Haber TV saying that ''if this country's media are not free, then the people will not be free either''. Pro-government media have largely expressed strong support for the arrests. All the participants in a studio discussion on pro-Erdogan Kanal 24 TV backed the actions of the authorities, with one of the guests warning that \"this is only the beginning\", and that new measures were imminent against a \"large gang'' made up of subversive elements in the police, the courts, the media and business circles. \"Those who see this as an issue of media freedom know pretty well where the real problem lies,\" argues pro-government Yeni Safak. The paper states that no journalist should use his position \"as a cover for other things\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6[to] turn journalism into a weapon and make it an extension of the struggle for power\". Referring to last year's corruption allegations against Mr Erdogan, which he says were part of a plot to topple him, pro-government Sabah also points out that \"it is time for those who made hundreds of people suffer with fake evidence to account for what they did\". Pro-government Star recalls President Erdogan's promise to end Mr Gulen's alleged \"parallel-state structure\" and his words that \"we will go into their caves\". \"Their caves have been entered,\" the daily says in a headline. The Star cautions Mr Erdogan's critics not to make hasty accusations, but rather to wait for the results of the investigation, which will reveal whether Zaman's editor-in-chief was really arrested for his journalistic activities.

El Hadary is playing at his seventh Nations Cup and has won four titles. At this tournament he became the oldest player at a major continental championship, and on Wednesday he made his 150th appearance for the Pharaohs. It is remarkable to think he arrived in Gabon as one of Egypt's back-up goalkeepers to first-choice Ahmed El Shenawy, but injuries meant he was brought in 25 minutes into Egypt's first game. Since then he has been formidable, conceding only one goal from normal play - in Wednesday's semi-final when Burkina Faso equalised in the second half. And now a place in Sunday's final in Libreville, where Egypt face either Cameroon or Ghana, offers him a chance to become the first player to win five Nations Cup titles.

{"article": "Pembrolizumab is a treatment for advanced skin cancer and is the first medicine to be approved through the Early Access to Medicines scheme (EAMS), launched in England last April. The idea is to get pioneering drugs to severely ill patients much sooner. Drugs signed off through EAMS have been scrutinised by regulators, weighing the risks and benefits. A green light by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) means doctors anywhere in the UK can prescribe the drug in question before normal licensing procedures - which can take years - are complete. Melanoma is the sixth most common cancer in the UK and kills more than 2,000 people in Britain each year. Damage to the skin by the sun's harmful UV rays increases your risk of developing this cancer. While advanced melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body may not be curable, targeted treatment can ease symptoms and may extend life. Clinical trials of pembrolizumab, which is injected into the bloodstream, suggest it has great promise for treating advanced disease. The treatment is considered a \"next generation\" drug in cancer care, stimulating the body's immune system to fight the disease. It blocks a biological pathway that the cancer uses to disguise itself from attack. Clinical trials are still under way, although the drug has already received a licence in the US for treating advanced melanoma. Until now, UK patients would only have been able to get pembrolizumab if they were on a clinical trial. Another government scheme in England, known as the The Cancer Drugs Fund, pays for cancer drugs that have already been licensed but not yet approved by the NHS watchdog NICE. MHRA chief executive Dr Ian Hudson said: \"We are delighted to issue the first positive Early Access to Medicines Scheme scientific opinion. \"The scientific opinion describes the risks and benefits of the medicine and the context for its use, supporting the prescriber and patient to make a decision on whether to use the medicine before its licence is approved.\" Emma Greenwood of Cancer Research UK said: \"Pembrolizumab is another example of the great progress we've made in developing immune treatments for cancer, so it's encouraging to see it being made available to patients earlier. \"NICE and the Cancer Drugs Fund only look at licensed drugs, so it's a step in the right direction in terms of patients getting access to new treatments faster.

{"article": "Mr Osborne said the changes would allow councils to allocate more sites for building homes specifically for people who already live or work in the area. He said he also wanted to improve transport, schools and broadband in rural areas to boost the rural economy. But Labour said the plans were ignoring the need for more affordable homes. The chancellor wants to extend the government's \"starter homes\" scheme, announced before the election for brownfield sites, to some villages. The initiative offers young local first-time home buyers a 20% discount on the price of the property. As it stands, the discount will be offered on homes up to \u00c2\u00a3250,000 outside London and \u00c2\u00a3450,000 inside London. The measures are part of Mr Osborne's new rural productivity plan, which will be unveiled later. Steve Reed, Labour's shadow local government minister, said the Conservatives' housing policies had made things worse for people in rural communities. \"The government says it wants to build starter homes in rural areas but it seems these will replace affordable homes to buy and rent - starter homes should be additional to affordable housing supply not instead of it,\" he said. \"In many rural areas buying or renting a home has become increasingly unaffordable. Yet the government has undermined the provision of affordable housing at every step by watering down requirements on developers to build new affordable homes.\" Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Osborne said rural areas were an increasingly dynamic part of the economy, with 60,000 people moving from the city to the countryside each year. He has pledged to continue to protect the Green Belt but said he wanted to \"make it easier for people to stay in their rural communities and for newcomers to settle there too\". He and Environment Secretary Liz Truss write in their joint newspaper editorial: \"For rural areas, we want better internet and mobile phone communications, better transport, better schools, better skills, better housing, better business growth and better local government. \"And we'll look at planning and regulatory constraints facing rural businesses. In a recent survey of rural businesses the main barrier to growth that most identified was planning restrictions. \"So for a start, we'll review rules around agricultural buildings such as barns to allow rural businesses to expand more easily.\" The Campaign for Rural England said it welcomed the government's recognition that rural areas could boost the economy, but it voiced concern that the \"beautiful English countryside\" was at risk of \"inappropriate developments\". Planning officer John Rowley said: \"We recognise that providing the right houses in the right places that meet local need is a vital part of ensuring our villages remain vibrant and sustainable. \"However, the proposals risk alienating local communities and reducing the amount of affordable housing in rural areas. The government's suggestion that young families will be able to afford houses at even 20% discount will not ring true in many low-waged rural economies.\" He added it was likely that commuters would be able to outbid local families, taking advantage of the discount which would not continue on resale - and therefore there would be no incentive for local people to back any new developments.", "abstract": "Chancellor George Osborne has said he wants to reform planning laws to make it easier for villages in England to build new starter homes.", "candidate": "First-time home buyers in rural areas will get a discount on the price of properties under plans to be announced by the chancellor.", "doc_id": 3659, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "First-time home buyers will get a discount on the price of properties under plans to be announced by the chancellor", "evidence": "The initiative offers young local first-time home buyers a 20% discount on the price of the property.", "explanation": "it makes up that the discount is for rural areas", "instruction": "Remove the information about the discount being for rural areas from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about the discount being for rural areas from the summary."]}}

Mr Trump was interviewed on Thursday night by Larry King, a former CNN host who now presents a show on RT America, a Russian-funded TV network. Trump and Putin: The new bromantics? When King asked him about reports that Russia is trying to disrupt the US election, Mr Trump was sceptical. \"I think it's probably unlikely,\" he said. \"I think maybe the Democrats are putting that out. \"I hope that if they are doing something, I hope that somebody's going to be able to find out, so they can end it, because that would not be appropriate at all.\" A Trump spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, suggested Mr Trump did not realise King's show was part of a Russian-backed network. \"Mr Trump recorded a short interview with Larry King for his podcast as a favour to Mr King,\" she said. Why Trump strikes a chord with Russians . \"What Larry King does with the interview content is up to him. We have nothing to do with it.\" Back in the late 1980s and 1990s, Larry King was a titan of US political media. A guest spot on his television call-in show provided current and aspiring candidates a way to reach a national audience in a low-stress, friendly environment. Donald Trump, back when he was just a larger-then-life real-estate developer and New York socialite, was a regular on King's programme. It's not entirely surprising then that the Republican nominee accepted an interview request from his long-time friend. That, however, is when Mr Trump's staff should have done a bit of research, found out the interview would be broadcast on RT and told their candidate to come up with a scheduling conflict and politely pull out. Given the heat Mr Trump has taken recently for showering praise on Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russian-owned RT is the last outlet he should be on. This is either another example of the Trump team's questionable advance work or - perhaps more troubling - its judgement. No matter the explanation, the story re-enforces the politically damaging perception that Mr Trump is uncomfortably chummy with the Russian government. Private cyber-security analysts have blamed Russian intelligence agencies for electronic break-ins into Democratic Party computers that emerged in leaks over the summer. Earlier this week Defence Secretary Ash Carter said the US would not ignore Russia's \"efforts to interfere with our democratic processes\". During a televised forum on Wednesday on national security, Mr Trump complimented Mr Putin for having \"great control over his country\". Mr Putin has offered kind words for Trump in the past, too, describing him as \"a talented man\". The Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Corker, offered words of caution for Mr Trump on Thursday. \"One has to be a little careful to let flattery affect one's judgment,\" he told CNN. \"Let's face it, over the last several years, President Putin has operated in ways that very much have been against our interests.\" Mr Trump urged the Russians in July to hack into Mrs Clinton's emails to find messages that were deleted from her account amid an investigation into whether she abused state secrets. In a news conference on Thursday morning at a New York state airport, Mrs Clinton invoked conservatives' most revered US president as she pounced on Mr Trump's remarks. \"What would Ronald Reagan say about a Republican nominee who attacks American generals and heaps praise on Russia's president?\" she asked.", "abstract": "Donald Trump has told a Kremlin-funded TV network \"it's probably unlikely\" that Russia is trying to influence the US election.", "candidate": "Donald Trump has appeared on a Russian-funded TV network.", "doc_id": 3349, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "Mr Trump was interviewed on Thursday night by Larry King, a former CNN host who now presents a show on RT America, a Russian-funded TV network.", "explanation": "it correctly pulls the info (Trump, Russia, appears, TV) from the source text", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

Currently Tesco workers are paid \u00a37.62 an hour, which will rise to \u00a38.42 an hour by November 2018. The pay rise will put Tesco workers' pay above the \u00a37.90 level that the National Living Wage is expected to reach by 2018. The National Living Wage is the effective minimum wage for adults aged 25 and over, and is currently \u00a37.50. Those under the age of 25 are entitled to a lower minimum wage rate. Statutory minimum pay rates will continue to rise until at least 2020, according to recent government Budgets, and companies are planning for those changes, as well as striving to remain competitive with rivals in order to recruit and retain staff. Wage growth in the UK has been slow in recent years, but inflation has risen and other supermarkets have increased the wages they pay. Aldi recently announced a rise in hourly pay to \u00a38.53 an hour; Lidl's website says it pays store staff \u00a38.45 an hour. Tesco said it would increase hourly pay in three stages: to \u00a38.02 in November 2017, then to \u00a38.18 in July 2018 and to \u00a38.42 in November 2018. \"This reward package sees our biggest investment in store pay for a decade, and gives colleagues a sustainable pay deal that rewards them for everything they do, while allowing us to also attract new talent,\" said Tesco UK chief executive, Matt Davies.

{"article": "Bertie Acheson, who was 72, died after a confrontation with the intruder at his home in Glenmore Gardens, Coleraine, in April 2012. Paul James Manolito Toland, originally of The Cedars, Antrim, had pleaded guilty to Mr Acheson's manslaughter. After his release he must serve a further four and half years on licence. Toland, a father of four, has 18 previous convictions for burglary. He was confronted by his victim after he broke into the couple's home to steal money. There was a struggle and Mr Acheson, who cared for his disabled wife Sheila, suffered a heart attack and died on his kitchen floor. Speaking after the sentencing, the senior investigating officer in the case said the Acheson family had been left \"devastated\" by his loss, particularly his widow. Det Ch Insp Ian Harrison said the fact that Toland was sentenced on what would have been Mr Acheson's 75th birthday had a \"double impact\" on the pensioner's loved ones. \"A person who I deem to be dangerous has now been taken off the streets and people can now feel safe in their homes,\" the officer said. \"Paul Toland was a predator. He preyed on the vulnerable and elderly and equally infirm couple who had been married for 44 years. His actions resulted in the death of Bertie Acheson, for just over \u00c2\u00a3300.\" An earlier court hearing was told that the couple were woken up by the sound of breaking glass in the early hours of 20 April 2012. Mr Acheson went to investigate. His widow later told police she overheard a verbal altercation between her husband and an intruder, during which money was demanded. Mrs Acheson claimed she also heard the sound of a scuffle and gasping for breath. She managed to raise the alarm, but when ambulance personnel and police arrived at the scene, her husband was already dead. Toland had originally been charged with Mr Acheson's murder, but at a court hearing in October, a defence lawyer asked that his client be re-arraigned. Toland told Belfast Crown Court that he was not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter. He also admitted the robbery of Mrs Acheson, who had \u00c2\u00a3335 stolen from her purse during the burglary. Det Ch Insp Harrison paid tribute to the courage and resilience of the pensioner's family throughout the \"long and protracted inquiry\". The officer said that Toland had been in the couple's house the previous month to repair a vacuum cleaner and had been paid in cash. \"We believe that Toland's greed brought him back to the house in the expectation that he could break in and steal whatever cash he could get his hands on,\" Det Ch Insp Harrison added. He appealed to the public not to store cash at home saying they were exposing themselves to \"unnecessary risk\". \"In memory of Bertie Acheson, and to avoid the pain still being suffered by his family, please do not keep large amounts of money at home,\" the officer said.", "abstract": "A man has been jailed for four and a half years for killing a pensioner during a botched burglary at an elderly couple's home in County Londonderry.", "candidate": "A 30-year-old man who killed a pensioner during a burglary at his County Londonderry home has been jailed for seven years.", "doc_id": 1687, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "A  man who killed a pensioner during a burglary at his Glenmore Gardens home has been told after his release he must serve a further four and half years on licence.", "evidence": "Bertie Acheson, who was 72, died after a confrontation with the intruder at his home in Glenmore Gardens, Coleraine, in April 2012.

Mr Cruz called the story \"garbage, complete and utter lies\". \"It is a tabloid smear and it has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen.\" As evidence that Mr Trump planted the story, Mr Cruz pointed out that the only person quoted by name in the Enquirer story was Roger Stone, a former top adviser to the Trump campaign. He also noted that Mr Trump and National Enquirer CEO David Pecker are close friends. Ted Cruz came out swinging on Friday, condemning the Trump campaign in the strongest possible terms. Some of those terms may require additional explanation. \"He is a man for whom a term was coined for copulating with a rodent,\" Mr Cruz said of Roger Stone, a former Trump adviser. \"Well let me be clear, Donald Trump may be a rat, but I have no desire to copulate with him.\" What? Mr Cruz is referring to an obscene rat-themed euphemism for political dirty tricks. Mr Stone is credited with coining the phrase. Mr Stone got his start in politics working for President Richard Nixon. He later lost a position with Senator Bob Dole after a newspaper columnist named him as one of Nixon's \"dirty tricksters\". Such tricks included ordering hundreds of pizzas to be delivered to rival campaigns, cancelling opponents' rallies, and engaging in deplorable behaviour while pretending to represent other candidates. Through the years, Mr Stone worked for various Republican politicians including Ronald Reagan. And he's never shed his reputation for hardball attacks. In a 2007 profile in the Weekly Standard, Mr Stone was dubbed the \"boastful black prince of Republican sleaze\". Asked whether he would still support Mr Trump, the current front-runner, if he won the Republican nomination, Mr Cruz did not answer directly. But the Texas senator said: \"I'm not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and my family.\" \"I had absolutely nothing to do with it,\" Mr Trump said in a statement. On Tuesday, the candidates, who had been on good terms earlier in the campaign, began trading insults on Twitter. Mistakenly believing the Cruz campaign had produced an attack advert about his wife Melania, Mr Trump on Twitter threatened to \"spill the beans\" on Mr Cruz's wife, Heidi. Mr Cruz responded saying his campaign did not produce the advert, calling Mr Trump \"classless\" and a \"coward\". The next day, Mr Trump continued, posting an unflattering photo of Mrs Cruz on Twitter.

They risk becoming a \"lost generation\", Ms Yousafzai warned. The BBC's Lyse Doucet was given exclusive access to the report ahead of its release on Friday. Ms Yousafzai, who was shot in the head by the Taliban after campaigning for education for girls in Pakistan, has been raising awareness of the lack of education for Syrian refugees. A growing number of Syrian girls are already teenage brides, or working in farms and factories, our chief international correspondent reports from the Jordanian capital, Amman. Major donors are under pressure from Syria's neighbouring countries to provide substantial long-term support if they wish to convince Syrian families to stay in the region instead of heading to Europe. \"It's time for the world to match their commitment to get every Syrian child back in school,\" Malala Yousafzai told me in an email. The 18 year-old campaigner for children's rights will be attending the London Conference with 17-year-old Syrian education activist Muzoon Almellehan, whose family recently settled in the UK. \"My generation is not lost,\" she insists. But the longer Syrian children stay out school, the greater the risk they will not return. British officials say it is not a realistic goal to get them back in class by the end of the next academic year. But they are still pushing hard. UK International Development Secretary Justine Greening told me: \"We must ensure Syria's children do not become a lost generation.\" According to the report by Ms Yousafzai's's charitable fund, donors have provided only 37% of the money needed to supply resources such as school places and teachers. It says $1.4bn (\u00c2\u00a31bn) a year is urgently needed to plug the gap. Ms Yousafzai has warned that children are being deprived of education at a time when they begin to form into future doctors, teachers, and engineers. The report comes ahead of next week's Syria Conference in London, where donors will be asked to pledge that all Syrian refugee children in the region should be in school by the end of the next academic year.

Insp Ellis, who was in charge of officers meeting Liverpool fans as they arrived in Sheffield, told the inquests that at 14:30 that day it was \"just a normal football match\".

{"article": "Falls in clothing and food prices were the main contributors to the change in the rate, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The ONS said the rate was also affected by a smaller rise in air fares in June than a year ago. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said he expects inflation to remain low in the immediate short term. But the Bank expects it to start picking up around the turn of the year. The rate of Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation - which includes housing costs such as mortgage interest payments and council tax - was 1% in June, unchanged from May. \"Inflation has continued its pattern of recent months, when prices have been very little changed on the previous year,\" said Philip Gooding from the ONS. \"The headline rate for June has dropped very slightly on May, back to zero, thanks to small downwards effects from movements in clothing and food prices and air fares.\" The CPI rate has been hovering around zero since February, and moved into negative territory in April for the first time on record, dropping to -0.1%. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at Global Insight, said the latest figure was good news for consumers. \"With earnings growth currently seeing clear improvement and employment high and rising, purchasing power is currently in rude heath,\" he added. While flat or low inflation can be good news for consumers, a prolonged period of negative inflation is generally perceived as harmful to an economy. The fear is that people will defer spending in the hope that goods or services will become cheaper later. The current inflation figure is well below the Bank of England's target of around 2%. Core inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices, fell last month to 0.8%. That was down from 0.9% and the joint-lowest rate since 2001. \"The data therefore raise questions over the whether underlying price pressures are really picking up to the extent than the Bank of England is anticipating,\" said Chris Williamson, chief UK economist at Markit. He said that attention would now turn to Wednesday's wage growth data, . \"The Bank of England needs to determine whether pay growth will continue to accelerate as firms compete for staff, or whether low inflation will keep the overall rate of increase below levels that would normally worry the monetary policy committee into hiking interest rates,\" he added.", "abstract": "The rate of UK Consumer Prices Index inflation fell to 0% in June, from 0.1% in May, official figures show.", "candidate": "The UK's Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation rate fell to zero in June, down from May's rate of 0.1%.", "doc_id": 3609, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "The UK's CPI inflation rate fell to zero in June, down from May's rate of 0.1%.", "evidence": "\"The headline rate for June has dropped very slightly on May, back to zero, thanks to small downwards effects from movements in clothing and food prices and air fares.\"", "explanation": "All correct except the CPI was spelled out as Consumer Prices Index which the source does not bring the full name up.", "instruction": "Remove the information about Consumer Prices Index before the (CPI) from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about Consumer Prices Index before the (CPI) from the summary."]}}

She was supposed to be on a plane on Tuesday, but 30,000 people signed a petition, Arfon MP Hywel Williams said. The Home Office said she could stay on an \"exceptional\" basis. Miss Satkunarajah was born in Sri Lanka, but fled conflict there with her parents when she was 12. While her father has since died, Mr Williams said she and her mother have been \"battling through the bureaucratic process to get the right to stay\". This has involved attending Caernarfon police station every week while she studies for an electrical engineering degree - which was where she was detained in a cell for three days. Mr Williams added others \"overstay for years\", but Miss Satkunarajah was \"picked up\" for doing what the authorities asked of her. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme, he said: \"They are picking off the easy ones because they are following the rules. \"She was easy to identify as was her mum. She turned up (at the police station) and they took her away.\" But he pointed to a \"huge wave of support\", saying more than 30,000 people signed a petition and letters were written by prominent figures. In the House of Commons on Tuesday, Mr Williams accused the Home Office of \"dithering\", criticising it for failing to give the case timely consideration. An 11th hour reprieve followed. \"In the light of the circumstances of this case, the immigration minister agreed that both Miss Satkunarajah and her mother should be allowed to stay in the UK on an exceptional basis while Miss Satkunarajah completes her studies,\" the Home Office said. She is due to finish the course this summer, with Mr Williams saying she is predicted to get a first class honours degree. Solicitor Raja Rajeswaran Uruthiravinayagan has now got involved in the case after public attention over the weekend. \"We were in the process of filing an emergency judicial review when we got indication the deportation had been deferred,\" he said. \"Shiromini and her mother have only been released on 'temporary admission'. \"This doesn't mean she's been given formal leave to stay in the UK. What we have to do now is send a pre-action protocol letter to the Home Secretary and give her 14 days to reply and consider the decision.\" NUS Wales deputy president Carmen Smith said she was \"overjoyed\" by the decision.

He also warned of a \"hard-line right-wing\" government - if Lib Dem seats are lost to the Conservatives, who would then be reliant on UKIP and DUP votes. The Conservatives and Labour have both insisted they can win on their own. But Mr Clegg said \"everyone knows\" that they will not and \"that means that someone else will hold the balance of power on May 8\" - be it a \"left-wing alliance between Labour and the SNP\" or a \"right wing alliance\" between the Conservatives, UKIP and the DUP. The Lib Dem leader is campaigning in north-west England on Thursday. He and David Cameron are not taking part in tonight's BBC TV debate involving the leaders of other parties. Asked how he stayed positive after a poll suggested his party could be wiped out in south-west England, losing all of its 14 seats in the region to the Conservatives, Mr Clegg said the poll itself was flawed. The Comres poll of 1,005 adults across the 14 seats suggested a 13-point swing from the Lib Dems to the Conservatives, with Labour, UKIP and the Greens also making gains at the expense of Mr Clegg's party. But the Lib Dem leader told LBC radio the poll had questioned the equivalent of 72 people per seat \"without even mentioning the candidates' names\". \"Polls like that are just absolute baloney,\" he said. \"The bogus science from some of this stuff is just extraordinary.\" He added: \"We will win so many more seats than this endless cottage industry of pessimistic punditry allows for.\" His party says there are 20 marginal seats where a Conservative win, at the expense of the Liberal Democrats, would result in a minority Conservative government reliant on UKIP and DUP votes to stay in power \"an alliance that will drag Britain further and further to the right\". The Lib Dems have dubbed the alliance \"Blukip\". The seats are; St Ives, St Austell and Newquay, North Cornwall, North Devon, Torbay, Cheadle, Hazel Grove, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Solihull, Brecon and Radnorshire, Bath, Montgomeryshire, Maidstone, Chippenham, Berwickshire, Watford, Mid Dorset and North Poole, Taunton, Somerton and Frome and Oxford West and Abingdon. At a news conference in Cheadle, Mr Clegg said that would mean an alliance involving people who did not believe in climate change, wanted to bring back the death penalty and who were against gay rights: \"There's a real prospect that David Cameron may have to rely on those people to stay in Number 10.\" Mr Clegg said he wanted to \"lift the lid\" on a \"genuine threat to our country\" - because he said moderate Conservative voters in marginal seats were being told if they did not vote Conservative, they would end up with a Labour administration propped up by the SNP.

{"article": "The shadow chancellor told the BBC Jeremy Corbyn had shown leadership by insisting the referendum result must be honoured and the UK should leave. But he said Labour would not back a \"kamikaze\" exit which hurt the economy. Some shadow ministers have suggested they would quit if forced to vote for kick-starting official EU exit talks. Dozens of Labour MPs who support remaining in the EU could be willing to defy the leadership if it whips them into voting for Brexit in the event of a Commons vote which could take place in the coming weeks. The government has said it will notify the EU of its decision to leave, beginning two years of talks about the terms of exit, by the end of March. Whether Parliament is asked to approve the Article 50 decision hinges on a Supreme Court ruling, due on Tuesday, into whether MPs and peers are required to have their say. The Labour leadership have been accused of \"dithering\" over their approach and are under pressure to clarify whether they will oppose the government's plan of leaving the single market and the customs union and restricting EU migration. Mr McDonnell said the debate was polarised between those who wanted to overturn the referendum result and, on the other hand, those who backed a so-called hard Brexit and saw the UK's future outside the EU as a virtual tax haven. Labour, he suggested, stood between these two poles and supported a negotiated settlement with the EU to protect jobs, wages and living standards. \"Jeremy Corbyn has taken a rather courageous position in that he recognises that you have to bring the country together at some stage and it will be over a traditional British compromise,\" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr show. \"Somewhere along the line there will be a sensible compromise and it will be Labour that is driving that compromise.\" Asked whether Labour MPs would be whipped to support the Article 50 process, he said the opposition had made it clear all along the referendum vote must be honoured. But he said Labour would seek to amend any government plans to guarantee the fullest scrutiny in Parliament and enable MPs from all parties to \"influence the negotiations\". Speaking on Sky News, Mr Corbyn said he would \"ask\" Labour MPs to respect the result while asked explicitly whether Labour wanted to stay in the single market, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott told the BBC's Sunday Politics that \"in terms of jobs and the economy, of course we should be\". Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader who is now the party's Brexit spokesman, said Labour had suffered a \"catastrophic loss of nerve\" over Europe. \"This absolute lack of clarity from Labour on the biggest issue of our times - dithering helplessly in the middle of the road - is only going to make their fate even worse.\" While he expected ministers to win any vote on Article 50, he told Andrew Marr he expected Theresa May to run into trouble if she \"digs her heels in\" in during the talks. The Lib Dems are pushing for the deal negotiated by Mrs May to be put to a referendum, saying the government had no mandate to \"yank\" the UK out of the single market. \"Whether we like it or not the single market, the biggest destination of our goods and services, is a market place of rules,\" he added. \"So even if we are out of it, we will have to abide by those rules. Once I think that becomes clear, the British public will start having some doubts.\" The Conservatives, which have promised Parliament a vote on the final deal, said Labour remained \"hopelessly divided and confused\". \"They can't agree over whether we should leave the single market and have said they will also find new ways of frustrating the process of leaving,\" said Tory MP Maria Caulfield.", "abstract": "Labour would back a \"sensible British compromise\" over Brexit, John McDonnell has said, amid calls for the party to clarify its position.", "candidate": "Labour will be driving a \"sensible compromise\" in the Brexit debate, John McDonnell has said.", "doc_id": 3280, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Labour will be driving a \"sensible compromise\" in the Brexit debate,  McDonnell has said.", "evidence": "\"Somewhere along the line there will be a sensible compromise and it will be Labour that is driving that compromise.\"", "explanation": "it makes up McDonnell's first name", "instruction": "Remove the information about McDonnell's first name from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about McDonnell's first name from the summary."]}}

Police should consider the long-term impact of investigation - such as labelling a child a \"sex offender\", the advice says. The NSPCC welcomed the change. National Police Chief's Council lead for child protection Chief Constable Simon Bailey, said: \"If this behaviour can be dealt with in other - more appropriate - ways then it should be.\" Typically in England and Wales, producing and distributing sexual images of anybody under 18 is a criminal offence, even if two under-18s are sexting one another. The new guidelines state that most offences involving sexual activity with children will require a \"full criminal investigative response\" - for example, in the presence of exploitation, coercion, a profit motive or adults as perpetrators. But it says: \"Offences involving self-generated images or images obtained with consent by other children may be dealt with differently. \"Forces may, for example, consider that suitably experienced first responders, safer school officers or neighbourhood teams can provide an appropriate response, thereby avoiding stigmatising children or causing them unnecessary fears and concerns.\" Forces should consider the long-term impact of investigation and prosecution - such as labelling a child a \"sex offender\" - in deciding whether criminal justice processes are necessary, the advice says. Ben was 15 when he and his girlfriend engaged in a sexually explicit online chat. He says: \"Because you're behind a screen you develop a sense of confidence in which you can say pretty much anything.\" Later, she asked him to send her a naked photo.

Mr Bailey said: \"More children than ever before are taking explicit images of themselves and this briefing note is a valuable resource for officers when dealing with these sensitive cases. \"It highlights the need for forces to consider the long-term impact of investigation and prosecution on young people. \"We will take all cases seriously with criminal investigations into those involving any form of exploitation. But it will always be a common-sense approach that doesn't criminalise children unnecessarily.\" He said sexting was not just \"harmless teenage behaviour\". \"There are significant risks involved for children and young people; once image is sent, control is lost, and it can cause significant distress when it gets into wider hands,\" he said.

FBI assistant director Ronald Hosko said the Operation Cross Country VII raids had been the agency's largest action against child exploitation. The FBI said 2,700 children have been rescued in such US raids since 2003. The victims in the most recent raids were almost all girls and range in age from 13 to 17. They had been prostituted in a variety of locations, including truck stops, casinos, motels as well as on social media and online advertisements. Mr Hosko said the accused had preyed on vulnerable teenagers, exploiting them over a period of time. \"Girls are enticed with compliments or offers, [asked] do they want to make some money,\" he said. \"Then they are trapped into this cycle that involves drugs, that involves physical abuse.

{"article": "In passing the law that allows legal action against Saudi Arabia over the 9/11 attacks, Congress over-ruled a veto by Mr Obama for the first time in his presidency. So why is it so controversial, and what are its wider implications? The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) was brought by the families of 9/11 victims, to allow them to sue any member of the Saudi government suspected of playing a role in the attacks. In practice, the bill permits civil claims against a foreign state or official for injuries, death, or damages from an act of international terrorism. Fifteen of the 19 terrorist who hijacked planes on 9/11 were Saudi nationals, and it has long been rumoured that senior Saudi officials were in some way linked to the attack. Official inquiries since 2001 have found there is no evidence of either the Saudi government or senior Saudi individuals funding al-Qaeda. However, a previously classified document earlier this year revealed \"while in the United States, some of the 9/11 hijackers were in contact with, and received support or assistance from, individuals who may be connected to the Saudi government\". While the document did not provide any direct evidence of top-level Saudi involvement, it did raise new questions. A veto is one of the most significant tools an American president has at his disposal, and has been used more than 2,500 times in America's history to prevent the passage of legislation. According to the US' House of Representatives, even the threat of a veto can bring about changes. Congress can overrule a veto however - but only if it has the support of two-thirds of the House and Senate. This has only happened on 110 occasions since 1792. Despite this, it is unusual for a president in recent years to get through two terms without congress overruling a veto. George W Bush had four overturned, while Bill Clinton had two during his tenure. The last presidency to go unchallenged was that of Lyndon B Johnson. President Barack Obama, who has only used a veto on 12 occasions and had, until now, never had one overruled, fears the amended law will leave America open to similar suits from other countries - especially as there is little consensus internationally on what constitutes an act of terrorism. Stephen Vladeck, professor of law at the University of Texas, explained: \"The real concern is that the more the US weakens the concept of foreign sovereign immunity, the more that the weakening will be used against it. \"President Obama is concerned that [something like] a drone strike against a suspected al-Qaeda target in Yemen or Pakistan or Somalia could very well be deemed by those countries as terrorism which could subject the US to significant liability in those courts.\" But Terry Strada, national chair for 9/11 Families United For Justice Against Terrorism, has disagreed that the bill could backfire in the way the White House has warned. \"If we're not funding terrorist organisations and killing people, then we don't have anything to worry about,\" she said. The bill may also have an impact on relations with Saudi Arabia, a key ally for the US in the Middle East. Salman al-Ansari, president of the Saudi American Public Relation Affairs Committee, said Saudi Arabia could reduce valuable security and intelligence co-operation as a result. The idea was to \"clear away\" obstacles and force an American court to answer whether and to what extent the Saudi government was involved in the 9/11 attacks. But Professor Vladeck says in its creation the bill has created more blocks which will \"probably\" lead to \"more litigation\". And even if the outcome is successful for the families, it will be little more than symbolic, he believes. \"The problem with JASTA is, it does not allow an American court to seize Saudi assets, or any foreign sovereign's assets, for this kind of claim,\" he says. \"So the best the plaintiffs can hope for is a piece of paper that says, yes the Saudi government was indirectly responsible because of funding, no you don't get any damages.\"", "abstract": "A new bill passed through the US Congress is creating a storm - with President Barack Obama and the CIA warning of its dire consequences.", "candidate": "US President Barack Obama has described it as \"one of the worst pieces of legislation that I've ever seen\".", "doc_id": 3743, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "US President Barack Obama has expressed concern that the legislation will leave America open to litigation from other countries.", "evidence": "President Barack Obama, who has only used a veto on 12 occasions and had, until now, never had one overruled, fears the amended law will leave America open to similar suits from other countries - especially as there is little consensus internationally on what constitutes an act of terrorism.", "explanation": "The summary states a quote from Obama not mentioned in the source text.", "instruction": "Replace the information about the quote from Obama with the information about Obama having said he feared litigation from other countries.", "instruction_list": ["Replace the information about the quote from Obama with the information about Obama having said he feared litigation from other countries."]}}

Suspecting water would begin to flow on 18 December, Senior Constable Hansson drove to the riverbank and started filming when the water began to cut through the dust. \"Come on down \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Come to papa!\" he can be heard yelling in the video. \"Here she comes... wow, I can't believe how lucky I am!\" His enthusiastic and very Australian response to the river's return to life would perhaps have gone unnoticed were it not for his daughter, Tahnee, who uploaded the video to YouTube on 19 December. This week the internet noticed it, and turned Snr Con Hansson into an overnight sensation. Speaking to the BBC from McKinlay Police Station, the straight-talking police officer said he was excited the river had run, but his chief concern was seeing the area emerge from drought. \"It's desperate times,\" he said. \"For about three months it looked like a desert, with no green grass left.\" \"The ground was bare and a lot of our pastoralists had been hand-feeding the stock to keep them alive.\" \"We had more rain across the Christmas season than we've had in the past two years.\" He said he was so excited on the video because he had not seen the river flow since moving to the area four years earlier. \"I patrol the area anyway so I just pulled up for a minute to see if the river would start.

{"article": "Speaking ahead of the register's launch, Alison White conceded a lot of lobbyists would not be listed on it. But she said her job was to make sure the rules were implemented and she would do so with \"extreme verve and vigour.\" But one critic of the register said it was \"fake\" and full of \"loopholes\". Lobbyists are companies or individuals paid to influence government decisions. The coalition promised to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists when it came to power in 2010, and legislation was passed last year, with ministers saying the move would help clean up politics. However, the new register will only cover consultant lobbyists and will not apply to lobbyists working \"in-house\" for companies or organisations. A person or company will only need to be registered if they are contacting a government minister or permanent secretary in a government department - leading to criticism it will not come close to reflecting the scale or nature of lobbying that goes on across Whitehall. But Ms White, who is independent of the government, said her task was to implement the law as it stood not to question the powers she had been given. \"We are having something that has never been in place before,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"This is a statutory register. The industry tells me it is a professional industry. I expect them to conform with the legislation. It is my job to make sure they do so.\" Ms White, who was appointed as the registrar of consultant lobbyists in September, acknowledged the register would not indicate different \"levels of lobbying\". \"The legislation was quite narrowly drafted to address a particular issue, which was that it was not always particularly clear, when ministers were being lobbied, who the client of the lobbyist was. That is what the register was set up to do,\" she said. She added: \"This will give anyone who wishes to access the register the opportunity to be able to see who is lobbying and being paid for it and who their clients are. That is the main information the register will contain. \"If a lobbyist sets out to influence government policy in some way, they would have to be registered. If they are not registered, then they would not be conforming. They have to go on the register before they lobby.\" Ms White said last month that the register would not have any entries on its launch day but she had received more than \"20 expressions of interest\" about joining and companies and individuals might be required to sign up retrospectively. Potential registrants will be able to log on and create an account to file an \"information return\". But Tamasin Cave, from the Alliance for Lobbying Transparency coalition, said \"hardly anyone\" in the industry would be covered by the provisions of the new law. \"You have a huge commercial lobbying industry, and very few of them will have to sign up,\" she told Today. \"The second flaw is that it won't show the interaction between lobbyists and government, and that is what a register is for. \"It is to show the activity - who is discussing what with whom, but this shows nothing of this interaction.

{"article": "The little girl sustained two injuries in 2013 - a bite mark to her face aged nine months, and a fracture to her upper arm when she was 13 months old. A Crown Court judge branded the offences by her 30-year-old father as \"appalling\". He was given a 12-month prison sentence which will be followed by two years on licence upon his release. The 30-year-old man, who lives in the Ards Peninsula, was found guilty of two charges - being cruel to a child and causing her grievous bodily harm. He told the court he could not cope with parenting, and claimed that the more his daughter cried, the more stressed he became. Belfast Crown Court heard that the child's father has Asperger's Syndrome, which the judge accepted may have impacted on how he dealt with stress. However, the judge said that whilst his condition may be relevant to explain some of his behaviour, the offences were serious and as such attracted a custodial sentence. Also appearing in court was the child's mother, who was made the subject of a two-year probation order after she admitted a single charge of child cruelty. The judge said that she failed, as a mother, to protect her child from the risk of harm posed by her partner, given she was aware of the first incident where her daughter's face was injured. Neither the child's mother nor her father can be named in order to protect the identity of the little girl, who the court heard is now living with a family member and is \"thriving.\" The court also heard that the couple broke up sometime between the first and second assault as the father still had access to his daughter. The judge told the 30-year-old: \"Such appalling offences against a helpless and vulnerable baby cannot be treated lightly.\" During sentencing on Friday, it emerged that the father has had no contact with his daughter since the second assault and is unlikely to do so, while the child's mother has limited access.", "abstract": "A man who assaulted his baby daughter on two separate occasions in the family home in west Belfast has been jailed.", "candidate": "A County Antrim father who assaulted his baby daughter has been jailed.", "doc_id": 2873, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "A father who assaulted his baby daughter has been jailed", "evidence": "He was given a 12-month prison sentence which will be followed by two years on licence upon his release.", "explanation": "it makes up the county it happened in", "instruction": "Remove the information about the county it happened in from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about the county it happened in from the summary."]}}

{"article": "Seven of her relatives have been arrested, and accused of misusing their royal status to amass vast wealth and carry out numerous abuses. The crown prince himself has now made the disgrace official by ordering her family to stop using the name Akrapongpreecha, which he gave them after he married her in 2001. The king and the crown prince both have this privilege, akin to knighthoods in the UK. Interestingly, the crown prince has not revoked her royal title, \"Mom\", which translates roughly as \"princess\", nor yet her use of the royal family's name, Mahidol na Ayutthaya. These are officially bestowed by King Bhumibol Adulyadej, and it would need his approval for them to be revoked. However if, as expected, the crown prince divorces Princess Srirasmi, she will almost certainly lose both titles. The future status of her nine-year-old son by the prince, Dipangkorn, will depend on his father's wishes. Titles matter a great deal in status-obsessed Thailand, in particular when it comes to those with a claim to the throne. The 1924 Palace Succession Law, enshrined in subsequent constitutions, follows the principle of primogeniture, meaning Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn is the designated heir to King Bhumibol, and his own sons should inherit the throne after him, ranked by age. However, the law also gives reigning kings considerable sway in choosing their own successor - and an amendment to the constitution now allows the possibility of a female successor. The crown prince has four sons by his second marriage, whom he disowned in 1997 when he severed all ties with their mother, Yuvadhida Polpraserth. At the time the crown prince stated that they had renounced all their royal titles. But the palace continues to recognise their right to use the title HSH, or His Serene Highness, even though the boys, now grown up, are banished from Thailand and live in the United States. That leaves some doubt over where they sit in line to the throne, even though most commentators believe they are no longer considered possible successors. It is widely believed that the crown prince may have had another baby boy this year with his current mistress, who is likely to become his next wife. The issue is critical in a country where the monarchy is considered pivotal to political stability, and where King Bhumibol, who turns 87 this week, is in such frail health. Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn appears to be sorting out his personal affairs before the succession, so that he can choose who will be his queen, and who will eventually succeed him.", "abstract": "The downfall of Princess Srirasmi, the wife of Thailand's Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, has been both dramatic and unusually public.", "candidate": "The scandal surrounding Princess Srirasmi, the wife of Thailand's Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, has gripped the country.", "doc_id": 3590, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "The scandal surrounding Princess Srirasmi, the wife of Thailand's Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, has gripped the country.", "evidence": "The future status of her nine-year-old son by the prince, Dipangkorn, will depend on his father's wishes.

They say interest in the 23 June poll is high although the campaign is perceived as being dominated by \"old men shouting at each other\". Young people are twice as likely not to be signed up as the public at large. In five weeks' time, the UK will decide whether it should remain a member of the European Union or not, with British citizens aged 18 and over and specified others entitled to vote. It will be the first public vote on the country's future in Europe for more than 50 years. Amid concerns about levels of youth turnout, efforts are being stepped up to encourage young people to sign up to vote in time to take part. Those who registered ahead of the local and national elections on 5 May do not need to re-register. The #TurnUp campaign, which launches on 31 May, is focused on getting young voters to encourage their friends and colleagues to sign up at events in universities, youth clubs, workplaces and cafes. A survey of 1,300 18-30 year olds carried out by YouGov suggests 51% are closely following the referendum, 39% are not while 10% are avoiding coverage of it altogether. While the majority - 52% - of those polled said the economy was the most important issue in determining how to vote, the research found low levels of trust in those representing either side in the referendum debate. Only 10% of those canvassed trusted politicians to make the case for either a Remain or Leave vote, while the figures for the media (13%) and business leaders (16%) were only slightly higher.

But Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) said there were practical problems with that proposal, for example his ventilation equipment would not be able to fit through their front door. The judge will rule on Wednesday. At Tuesday's hearing, the judge said hospital managers had suggested a hospice would give Charlie and his parents the space, privacy and protection they needed. Chris Gard and Connie Yates have pleaded for a paediatric intensive care doctor to come forward to help their son die at home. \"We promised Charlie every day we would take him home. It seems really upsetting after everything we've been through to deny us this,\" Ms Yates said. Grant Armstrong, representing the parents, told Mr Justice Francis that his clients' \"last wish is that Charlie dies at home\". He suggested a portable ventilator and oxygen supply could be used but accused GOSH of \"putting up obstacles\". Lawyers for the hospital told the judge they \"would like to be able to fulfil the parents' wishes... if it is safe and practicable and in Charlie's best interests\". However, Katie Gollop QC, who leads the hospital's legal team, said providing intensive care for Charlie away from a hospital was not simple. Charlie's condition requires air to be forced into his lungs. She said as far as the hospital was aware invasive ventilation was only provided in a hospital setting. Ms Gollop said Charlie would need to be \"monitored by an ITU trained nurse at all times, with an ITU doctor on call and close at hand\". Such resources \"cannot be provided by GOSH to Charlie at his parents' home\", she said. Mr Justice Francis said: \"If going home can be achieved within reason then I would like to achieve that for them.\" He said he would make a final decision, about whether Charlie can be taken home, at 14:00 BST on Wednesday. Charlie's parents, from Bedfont, west London, said they had been spending their \"last precious moments\" with their son. Charlie has encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome. He has brain damage and cannot move his arms or legs. His parents had asked Mr Justice Francis to rule that their son should be allowed to undergo a trial of nucleoside therapy in New York, a move opposed by medics at GOSH who argued the treatment would be \"futile\". The Family Division of the High Court heard on Monday that US neurologist Professor Michio Hirano was no longer willing to offer the experimental therapy after he had seen the results of a new MRI scan. In a statement to the High Court, GOSH said Professor Michio Hirano had not taken the opportunity to see Charlie until last week, despite being offered the chance to do so by the hospital in January. The hospital said it was also concerned the professor had declared a financial interest in some of the treatment he had proposed prescribing for Charlie.

{"article": "Communities Minister Lesley Griffiths said planning would start two months before an inmate was due for release. Shelter Cymru welcomed the introduction of measures to prevent homelessness. Campaigners have voiced frustration that prison leavers are still being housed in B&Bs a year after a woman was killed by a homeless ex-offender. A review is taking place into the mental health support given to Matthew Williams, 34. He died following his arrest for attacking Cerys Yemm, 22, at the Sirhowy Arms Hotel in Argoed, Caerphilly county, in November 2014.

{"article": "The young leaders want greater autonomy and changes to the way Hong Kong is governed by China. Voter turnout reached a record high of 58%. Among those elected is Nathan Law, 23, who helped lead the \"Umbrella Protests\" in 2014 for self-determination. Despite the gains, China's supporters will continue to hold the majority of seats on the 70-seat council. Mr Law expressed shock at the result, saying it showed people \"wanted change\". The election is the first in the territory since the 2014 unrest, when central areas of Hong Kong were paralysed for weeks by mostly young protesters. They were demanding greater democracy for the territory amid concerns that Beijing was increasingly interfering in the politics of the former British colony, breaking the \"one country, two systems\" agreement. Beijing denies this, and gave no concessions to the protesters. \"I think Hong Kongers really wanted change,\" Mr Law, 23, was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. \"Young people have a sense of urgency when it comes to the future.\" Mr Law, whose Demosisto party campaigns for the right to self-determination, had the second highest number of votes in the multi-seat Hong Kong Island constituency. Two candidates from the Youngspiration party, a more vocally pro-independence movement which also has its roots in the Umbrella Protests, were also on course to be elected. However, several veteran democrats failed to retain their seats. \"People want change, change meaning that they want new faces... but the price is a further fragmentation [of the pro-democracy camp],\" defeated candidate Lee Cheuk-yan told Reuters. Mr Law warned that pro-democracy legislators would \"have to be united to fight against the [Chinese] Communist Party\". Importantly for Mr Law and his allies, democrats have retained one third of seats in the council - meaning they have the ability to veto major constitutional changes. There will also be more radical voices in the LegCo, with at least six young candidates who support self-determination for Hong Kong occupying seats. China's government has always been opposed to any calls for independence, and an official from the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State Council reiterated this point on Monday. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong government's Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Raymond Tam said it would do its best to \"bring them [radical activists] around to a more centrist position\". \"Independence is not realistic at all,\" said Elizabeth Quat, a member of a pro-Beijing party. \"Hopefully this will not be their main objective.\" The Chinese government has consistently denounced pro-democracy protests, calling the 2014 street occupations \"illegal\", and stressed that unity is the way forward for the country. Hong Kong papers have noted the \"record high turnout\" - the highest since 1997. Apple Daily describes \"a blazing atmosphere\", with hundreds queuing into the early hours. The South China Morning Post notes that a \"new generation\" has emerged from the vote and may \"create more headaches for Chief Executive CY Leung's administration\". A lot of mainland Chinese media have refrained from covering the election at all, or only covered it sparingly. Regulators have even blocked some foreigner broadcasters' coverage of the elections - including the BBC World News channel - and censored social media comments that mention pro-democrats. Yet the English language edition of Global Times says the days ahead will be \"a significant test of whether the pro-establishment camp can maintain dominance\". Candidates were competing for the 70 seats on the LegCo, which passes laws and budgets in the territory. But only 35 constituency seats are directly elected by the 3.8 million registered voters. Another 30 seats, called \"functional constituencies\", represent particular professions or trades and only people connected to those professions or trades can cast votes for those seats. That is about 6% of the population, and they are mostly Beijing-leaning. Representatives for a further five functional constituencies, known as \"super seats\" are chosen by voters across the territory. The vote does not elect Hong Kong's chief executive, the head of government, but many analysts believe the outcome could have an impact on whether China supports current leader CY Leung for a second term in office.", "abstract": "A new generation of pro-democracy activists has won seats on Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo).", "candidate": "Three pro-democracy candidates have won seats in Hong Kong's Legislative Council.", "doc_id": 3050, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "Two candidates from the Youngspiration party, a more vocally pro-independence movement which also has its roots in the Umbrella Protests, were also on course to be elected.", "explanation": "the summary is fully supported by the source text, although it does require some thought to interpret and verify all the info, e.g. the summary mentions the \"Legislative Council,\" while the source text only refers to this as the \"LegCo,\" but given a clear understanding of the context it is obviously the same thing.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

{"article": "In rational, post-Enlightenment Europe, religion has long since been relegated to a safe space, with Judaism and Christianity the safe targets of satire in secular western societies. Not so Islam. The battle within Islam itself between Sunni and Shia, so evident in the wars of the Middle East, and the fight between extremist interpretations of Islam such as those of Islamic State and Muslims who wish to practice their religion in peace, is now being played out on the streets of Europe with potentially devastating consequences for social cohesion. These latest shootings may be the work of \"lone wolves\" but their consequences will ripple across Europe and provoke much soul-searching about the failure of integration over the past decades. Immigrant communities are already being viewed with increasing suspicion in both France and Germany, with their significant Muslim populations, and even in the UK. France has the largest Muslim population in Europe, some five million or 7.5% of the population, compared with Germany's four million or 5% of the population, and the UK's three million, also 5% of the population. In all three, mainstream political parties are being forced to confront popular discontent over levels of immigration and the apparent desire of some younger, often disaffected children or grandchildren of immigrant families not to conform to western, liberal lifestyles - including traditions of religious tolerance and free speech. In the UK, that unease has largely played out on the public stage in a more peaceable manner, in the debate over \"British values\" and the recent Trojan horse schools affair. The fatwa against the writer Salman Rushdie over 20 years ago following the publication of The Satanic Verses, forcing him into hiding for several years, was perhaps the first time the issue impinged on British consciousness, though the attacks of 7/7 were a reminder that extremist violence could also hit the heart of the UK. However, France has already seen much more violence on its streets carried out in the name of religion over the past decades, although it has tried to write off most of its recent \"lone wolf\" attacks as the acts of mentally-unhinged individuals. But some in its Jewish community have responded to increasing anti-Semitism and the killing of Jews in France and Belgium by Islamist extremists by emigrating to Israel and elsewhere. Recent physical attacks on synagogues and Jews in the suburbs of Paris, where Jews and Muslims often live side by side in poorer areas such as Sarcelles, only exacerbated fears that the violence in the name of religion that grips parts of Africa and the Middle East, and which so many flee to Europe to escape, has followed them here. Germany, too, has seen a rising surge of anti-Islam sentiment in its cities, with worries about young radicalised Muslims moving from a concern confined to far right and neo-Nazi parties into the mainstream, as seen in the recent popularity of the Pegida movement, which campaigns against the \"Islamisation\" of Europe. Both political and religious leaders in Germany have spoken out against the movement, and counter-marches have been held, but Pegida's fears have brought thousands onto the streets. The killings at Charlie Hebdo are a deeply unwelcome reminder to the west that for some, mainly young radicalised men, their fundamentalist interpretation of their religion matters enough to kill those who offend it. As a result, across western Europe, liberally-minded societies are beginning to divide over how best to deal with radical Islamism and its impact on their countries, while governments agonise over the potential for a backlash against Muslims living in Europe. Today, mainstream Muslim organisations in the UK and France have unequivocally condemned the killings, saying that terrorism is an affront to Islam. But the potential backlash, including support for far right parties and groups, may well hurt ordinary Muslims more than anyone else, leaving the authorities and religious leaders in western Europe wondering how to confront violence in the name of religion without victimizing minorities or being accused of 'Islamophobia'.", "abstract": "In the heart of Europe in 2015, the killing of cartoonists and journalists for allegedly insulting God still comes as a shock, despite the rising number of such attacks in recent years.", "candidate": "The shootings at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris are the latest in a series of attacks carried out in the name of religion.", "doc_id": 3383, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "The deaths at Charlie Hebdo are the latest in a series of attacks carried out in the name of religion.", "evidence": "The killings at Charlie Hebdo are a deeply unwelcome reminder to the west that for some, mainly young radicalised men, their fundamentalist interpretation of their religion matters enough to kill those who offend it.", "explanation": "The summary states deaths were shootings at offices of a satirical magazine but the source text only mentions killings at Charlie Hebdo specifically.

Landscape charity the John Muir Trust sought the review after the wind farm was given planning consent last year. The trust said the turbines would \"destroy the character\" of wild land. Stuart Brooks, the John Muir Trust's chief executive, said the charity was \"delighted\" with the review's result. The Mountaineering Council of Scotland and National Trust for Scotland have also welcomed the judicial review. SSE said it was \"disappointed\". The court heard that Scottish Natural Heritage had objected in principle to the wind farm's proposed site. Lord Jones said: \"If the ministers did take into consideration SNH's objection in principle to any wind farm development at Stronelairg, they have given no reason for rejecting it, and the decision is defective on that account.\" The public was also denied an opportunity to comment on a revised planning application for the proposed wind farm, the judge said. He said the government's decision to give consent should be set aside. Energy Minister Fergus Ewing granted permission for SSE Renewables' project in July last year. It was said at that time the wind farm could generate enough electricity to power 114,000 homes. The operators also said it would bring \u00c2\u00a330m-worth of benefits to the region.

His comments come a day after unemployment rose for the first time in two years. \"That suggests the Bank's interpretation of those statistics is that unemployment falls are now being held back by skills shortages,\" said the BBC's economics editor Robert Peston. \"And those skills shortages are also responsible for rising wage inflation.\" On Tuesday, outgoing MPC member David Miles, regarded as someone who is cautious about the impact of rise, surprised markets by saying it was \"likely to be right\" to hike rates soon. On Wednesday, Janet Yellen, the chair of the US's Federal Reserve indicated that interest rates are likely to rise in the US this year. That could be a few months earlier than in the UK if indeed the Bank of England were to move in the new year. If rates were to rise early in the new year, from the current all-time record low of 0.5%, that would be three or four months after the expected equivalent move by the US Federal Reserve. Now for those of you with big debts looking for reassurance that you are not going to be financially crippled by the increase, he has said two other things of note about the so-called Bank Rate. First typical interest rate changes, increments, will be typically much smaller than the half of a percentage point that they used to be before the Crash of 2008 - so probably one quarter of a percentage point, or even possibly an eighth. Also he has signalled that the new normal rate of interest over the medium term after a succession of rises over two or three years will be perhaps half the 4.5% over rate of the past 300 years. So nearer 2%.

{"article": "Mark Jones, 45, of Cwmbran, denies murdering Amelia Jones in Pontnewydd in November, 2012. His daughter Sarah Jones was asked by the defence barrister, Roger Thomas QC, about a trip to the doctors with Amelia on 7 November 2012. She admitted \"exaggerating\" about the doctor's diagnosis. Mr Thomas asked her what the diagnosis was and Ms Jones told the court: \"She had a cold\". The court was told that she had previously said, in a text message: \"They want to check her, and they might keep her in overnight\". Mr Thomas suggested those two accounts differed from each other. Sarah Jones replied \"Don't you over-exaggerate with stuff sometimes\". Mr Thomas asked, \"So you do exaggerate?\" Ms Jones then replied: \"Yes\". Ms Jones, 26, told Newport Crown Court on Tuesday she found Amelia in tears after leaving her in Mr Jones's care in a car during a shopping trip, days before her death. The defendant's barrister quizzed Ms Jones as to why she gave uncertain answers in a police interview about whether she actually went shopping on that day. She said from the stand: \"I had all my other children taken off me, I had been arrested for murder; I wasn't in the right frame of mind.\" Ms Jones was later released and her children were returned to her, the court heard. But Mr Thomas said the incident relating to Amelia being upset in Mr Jones's care \"didn't happen at all like this\". He said \"Amelia was left alone in the house with Mark\", and not in a car, as she had suggested. The QC accused Ms Jones of \"not being entirely fair and truthful\" about her recollection, adding: \"The incident you have described yesterday did not occur\". \"It did occur\", she replied. Prosecuting counsel, Paul Lewis, asked Ms Jones if she had \"ever laid a finger on Amelia, so as to harm her\". She replied: \"No, not at all\". Ms Jones told the court she now has another child with Amelia's father, Ian Skillern, who was born in 2013. The pair are no longer in a relationship. During earlier evidence, Ms Jones claimed her father said Amelia had been \"a nightmare\" when he babysat the night before the baby received her fatal injuries.

{"article": "Glenn Houston, who was the only original panel member, cited personal reasons for his departure. He remained on the inquiry team last year after the resignation of the chairwoman, Susan O'Brien QC, and panel member Prof Michael Lamb. One survivors' group said it was \"indicative of a crisis\" in the inquiry which is examining allegations of child abuse in residential accommodation. Andi Lavery, spokesman for the survivors' group White Flowers Alba, said victims were rapidly losing confidence in the inquiry's credibility. And Alan Draper, from In Care Abuse Survivors, said survivors were \"at a loss\" to understand what was happening. He told BBC Scotland: \"There is concern that the inquiry is dominated by the legal profession, without any balance from other professional groups who have a detailed knowledge of child abuse and its impact and implications for survivors and their families. \"Survivors are considering withdrawing from this whole process until they are satisfied that survivors are placed at the centre of the inquiry. \"The inquiry is about what happened to them and the failure of the establishment to protect them from harm. This failure is continuing.\" The probe is due to report in late 2019. Mr Houston said a \"change in priorities\" in his working life meant he had applied for positions at the Northern Health and Social Care Trust and the Disclosure and Barring Service. \"I have now been successful in those applications and the appointments have been made,\" he said. \"Lady Smith and I have discussed the potential that at some future time, a perception of conflict of interest may arise between these appointments and my work as a panel member on the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry. \"After careful consideration of both the time commitment required to fulfil these new roles and the potential, however small, for perceptions to arise of conflict of interest, I have tendered my resignation to the inquiry.\" Mr Houston added that he had been \"honoured\" to be appointed to the panel. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said he had accepted the resignation of Mr Houston and thanked him for his positive contribution. \"I know this was not an easy decision for him to reach, but he can be very proud of the contribution he has made to the establishment of the Child Abuse Inquiry and to ensuring its continuing progress,\" he said. In July 2016, senior judge Lady Smith was appointed as the new chairwoman of the inquiry following Ms O'Brien's resignation. A successor to Mr Houston will not be appointed to the inquiry so Lady Smith will continue as the sole panel member. The Scottish government said this brought it in line with other public inquiries established in Scotland under the 2005 Inquiries Act. The abuse inquiry has been plagued by problems since it was set up in October 2015. More than \u00c2\u00a33.5m has been spent on it during this period. Prof Lamb resigned in June 2016 claiming the inquiry was \"doomed\". Ms O'Brien stood down days later after being told she faced the sack over \"unacceptable\" comments about child sex abuse victims. The QC complained of government interference in the inquiry which she said had \"undermined\" her. But the Scottish government denied it was interfering with the inquiry and Lady Smith has also since insisted the investigation will be fully independent. Scottish Labour said Mr Swinney needed to reassure survivors the inquiry would not be delayed further and urged him to appoint more panel members. The party's education spokesman Iain Gray added: \"What is important is that the inquiry proceeds promptly so survivors can feel a sense of justice.\"", "abstract": "A third senior figure on the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry has resigned.", "candidate": "A second member of the Scottish government's child abuse inquiry has resigned.", "doc_id": 1936, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Glenn Houston of the Scottish government's child abuse inquiry has resigned.", "evidence": "Glenn Houston, who was the only original panel member, cited personal reasons for his departure.", "explanation": "it makes up him being the second inquiry member to resign", "instruction": "Remove the information about him being the second inquiry member to resign from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about him being the second inquiry member to resign from the summary."]}}
{"article": "Organisers campaigning to save Lewisham Hospital say the plans are \"crazy and ill thought out\". Under proposals, its A&E will close and the maternity unit be downgraded after neighbouring South London Healthcare NHS Trust ran up debts of \u00c2\u00a3150m. The government said \"doing nothing is not an option\" and is to make a decision on 1 February. Campaigners are angry Lewisham Hospital, which is not part of the South London Healthcare NHS Trust, is being targeted in a re-organisation of services across the area following the trusts's financial problems. Under the plans, the trust's Queen Elizabeth Hospital site in Woolwich would come together with Lewisham Healthcare NHS Trust to create a new organisation. Lewisham's A&E unit would then be downgraded to an urgent care centre, meaning emergency cases would be seen at nearby hospitals. The maternity unit at Lewisham could also be slimmed down, meaning complex cases would be dealt with elsewhere. South London Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs three hospitals, was placed in administration last year when it started losing about \u00c2\u00a31.3m a week. The problems it faces are not unique. Last year it was reported 20 trusts had declared themselves financially unsustainable in their current form. Matthew Kershaw, a special administrator, said in a report to the government that the trust should be broken up, with other organisations taking over the management and delivery of services. If implemented fully, Mr Kershaw said his recommendations would result in a radical overhaul of services in south London, and help deliver \"safe, high-quality, affordable and sustainable services.\" Mr Kershaw also recommended the Department of Health (DoH) write off any debts to ensure new organisations were not \"saddled with the issues of the past\". \"I have said consistently that the status quo is not an option, and I believe these final, refined recommendations are the right ones, although I appreciate that some people will find them difficult to accept,\" his report said. In November thousands of people marched in protest at the plans and BBC London reporter Matt Morris said at least 15,000 attended Saturday's event. The Save Lewisham Hospital group said 25,000 took part. Dr Louise Irvine, a local GP and chairman of the Save Lewisham Hospital campaign, said: \"This decision is crazy and ill thought out. \"It is a big mistake and carries huge clinical risks of things going wrong for patients but also political risk. \"If Jeremy Hunt can close a good local hospital here, he can do it anywhere in the country - nowhere is safe.\" A DoH spokesman said: \"Where trusts face long-standing problems we have been clear that doing nothing is not an option.\" The march went past Lewisham Hospital and ended with a festival in nearby Mountsfield Park.", "abstract": "At least 15,000 people have marched in protest against proposals to close services at a hospital in south London.", "candidate": "Thousands of people have taken part in a rally against plans to close a south London hospital.", "doc_id": 1100, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Thousands of people have taken part in a rally against plans to downgrade a south London hospital.", "evidence": "In November thousands of people marched in protest at the plans and BBC London reporter Matt Morris said at least 15,000 attended Saturday's event.", "explanation": "The hospital isn't being closed, only reorganized/downgraded.", "instruction": "Replace the information about close with the information about downgrade.", "instruction_list": ["Replace the information about close with the information about downgrade."]}}

CCTV showed the 31-year-old threatening staff with the axe before shopkeeper Sab Dhillon tackled him to the floor and restrained him. Durham Crown Court heard McKerry, of Coundon, near Bishop Auckland, had earlier admitted attempted robbery. McKerry, whose face was hidden by a scarf and hood, brandished the weapon as he ordered shop assistant Andrea Brighty to fill a bag with money from the till, the court heard. But Mr Dhillon ran from a back office, grabbed McKerry from behind and wrestled him to the floor. The court heard McKerry, dubbed Boomerang Boy because of his repeated spells in prison, had been arrested more than 80 times. He was told he must serve an extended four-year licence period after he is released. The court was told McKerry started shoplifting at the age of 12 and by 15 he had been arrested 80 times, and had convictions for aggravated vehicle-taking, sending indecent letters, and burglary. McKerry once stole 22 charity boxes while dressed as a woman, and locals dubbed him a one-man crime wave. Dramatic CCTV footage from the shop showed the masked McKerry waving an axe as he demanded cash from terrified assistant Andrea Brighty. But he did not see Mr Dhillon's rugby tackle, which dropped him to the floor, sending shelves and produce tumbling. As the men wrestled, and with McKerry still holding the axe, Mr Dhillon's wife Sam helped, hitting him twice with a baseball bat to make him drop the weapon. Blood can be seen coming from the would-be robber's nose and Mr Dhillon gestured to his wife to drop the bat. Minutes later the police arrived and arrested McKerry, who, the court heard, had been arrested more than 80 times and had 64 previous convictions. Speaking to BBC Tees shortly after the raid, Mr Dhillon said: \"I was in the back storeroom on the computer and I heard Andrea, who was behind the counter shouting 'no, no, no'. \"I saw a guy waiving an axe at her. I came up behind him and pulled him away from Andrea and the counter.

{"article": "But it's 13 years since he left the television series and since then he's carved a hugely successful career in the theatre. His new stage show is about the reggae legend Bob Marley. But he insists, it is \"absolutely not\" a jukebox musical, where the songs take precedence over the plot. Kwei-Armah, the writer and director of One Love, The Bob Marley Musical, says it is not \"sing-a-long-a-Bob\", but \"a play with music\". He admitted though that it was a \"delicate\" balancing act trying to keep in enough songs the audience will recognise. So hits including No Woman No Cry, Jamming, Three Little Birds and Redemption Song are among 30 tracks that feature in the show. But One Love is not your usual musical hero, womb to tomb story. Instead it focuses on just three years in Marley's life and career, which Kwei-Armah says are \"very significant\" in \"understanding the hero's journey of the man.\" Following an assassination attempt in 1976, the singer left his home in Jamaica and went to live in London in self imposed exile. While in England he recorded two of his biggest albums: Exodus and Kaya. Kwei-Armah said he wanted to get inside the mind of the man at that time and \"show a side of Bob that we don't often speak about.\" \"Bob being a political songwriter, I wanted to look at what were the years when he was tested. What were the years when he might have doubted himself? And I found these years to be that.\" Marley died of cancer in 1981 at the age of 36. But interest in him shows no sign of diminishing. It is estimated he has sold more than 50 million albums around the world. Time declared Exodus the best album of the 20th Century in 1999. The same year the BBC named One Love the song of the millennium. His Facebook page has more than 70 million fans - and Marley is in the top 15 most popular pages on the social media site. For many, Bob Marley is an idol - a civil rights activist who spoke up for the poor and oppressed. But he was not a saint. And Kwai-Armah says he does not gloss over Marley's womanising and drug use. He says he portrays him \"warts and all\". He adds: \"I don't need any hero to be an angel.\" The singer Mitchell Brunings is playing the title role. Born in Surinam, but raised in The Netherlands, he was a backing vocalist in a Marley tribute band, before entering the Dutch equivalent of the television talent show, The Voice. He sang Redemption Song and his performance went viral on YouTube. As a result, Kwai-Armah cast him in the lead role. It is his UK stage debut and he is feeling the pressure to do Marley justice. \"He has a very big following, a lot of his followers are fanatical about their devotion to him, which I understand because I am one of his followers myself. I don't want to do anything to damage his image.\" Marley's family has already given the show their blessing. His daughter Cedella has said: \"Birmingham is a natural place for its UK premiere. With its great mix of cultures, it's a city where my father performed to audiences that were captivated by his presence. \"We have no doubt that telling the story through music to a new generation in Birmingham will be part of his continuing legacy.\" One Love: The Bob Marley Musical opens at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre on 10th March.

{"article": "Researchers say the huge predator had scales much like modern reptiles rather than feathers or fluff. The dinosaur may have ditched its feathers because it no longer needed insulation when it reached gigantic proportions, they propose. But the findings are unlikely to end the long-running debate about the physical appearance of T. rex. We don't need to throw out the image of a big fluffy T. rex quite yet, argued one palaeontologist. Whether T.rex was clad in scales, feathers or both, has long been a mystery, largely due to a lack of fossil evidence. Primitive feathers have been identified in some members of the Tyrannosaur group, leading to speculation that the king of reptiles also sported feathers. In the latest twist, researchers analysed skin impressions from a T.rex skeleton known as Wyrex, unearthed in Montana. They also looked at relatives that roamed during the Late Cretaceous in Asia and other parts of North America, including Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus. Skin patches from the neck, pelvis and tail of Wyrex show scaly, reptilian-like skin, says a team led by Dr Phil Bell of the University of New England, Australia. Writing in the journal, Biology Letters, they say fossil integument (outer covering) from T.rex and other members of the group confirm that \"these large-bodied forms possessed scaly reptilian-like skin.' The researchers think the giant tyrannosaurs lost their feathers over time because they no longer needed them as insulation. But not all researchers are convinced. Dr Steve Brusatte of the University of Edinburgh said he wouldn't be surprised if T. rex lost or reduced its feathers, as it was a very big animal, just like elephants reduce their hair. Asian elephants are hairier than African elephants because they are smaller and live in dense forests in dim sunlight. \"But I don't think we can assume that T. rex lacked feathers just because some fossil skeletons have skin impressions that are scaly,\" he added. \"It takes inconceivable good luck to preserve feathers in fossils. Just because we don't see them doesn't mean they weren't there.

{"article": "The American, who cannot be identified, said the therapy for Charlie Gard would be \"treatment but not a cure\". A decision whether to turn off his life support machines is being considered by the High Court. Connie Yates and Chris Gard want to take their son who has progressive muscle weakness to the US. A crowdfunding campaign for the trip is now less than \u00a360,000 short of its \u00a31.3m target. The judge is analysing medical evidence at a hearing in the Family Division before deciding what option is in Charlie's best interests. The neurologist who would oversee the treatment told the court that while Charlie was in the \"terminal stage\" of his illness, treating him would be compassionate. He said the therapy, which would be tried for six months, would provide a \"small chance\" of a meaningful improvement in Charlie's brain function. \"[Charlie] may be able to interact. To smile. To look at objects,\" he said. Sophia Roper, representing Charlie's parents, also told the court there was \"no evidence that he is on a regular basis in pain\". Doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital said the baby receives 24-hour care and should be allowed to die with dignity. But the couple, who live in London, believe seven-month-old Charlie may have a chance of surviving if he receives treatment abroad. \"We just want to have our chance. It would never be a cure but it could help him live. If it saves him, amazing,\" Miss Yates said. \"I want to save others. Even if Charlie doesn't make it through this, I don't ever want another mum and their child to go through this.\" Though born healthy in August, Charlie began to lose weight and strength by the time he was eight weeks old. He was admitted to Great Ormond Street in October after developing aspiration pneumonia and was diagnosed with mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Last month, his parents told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme they would continue to fight for their child's survival. They said: \"He can move his mouth, he can move his hands. He can't open them fully, but he can still open his eyes and see us, in response to us.\" An online campaign raised an initial \u00a31.2m, but an extra \u00a3100,000 is now needed to help pay fees on the GoFundMe website and extend Charlie's stay in America. While it is free to host a campaign on GoFundMe.com, fees are deducted from each donation. In the UK 5% of each donation goes towards supporting GoFundMe, while 2.68% is charged for processing fees plus VAT. Those paying towards UK-based campaigns from outside the European Economic Area can expect up to 9.48% of their donation to go towards these fees, the website says. Charlie is thought to be just one of 16 children in the world to have mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Earlier this month, a spokesperson for Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust said it had \"exhausted\" all proven treatment options. \"We cannot imagine how hugely distressing this is for his family,\" they added. \"We continue to support them in every way we can, while advocating, what we believe, is best for Charlie.\"", "abstract": "The doctor who would give experimental treatment to a baby who has a rare genetic condition has admitted the case was \"uncharted territory\".", "candidate": "A terminally ill baby at the centre of a legal battle to take him to the US for treatment may be able to smile, a court has heard.", "doc_id": 1459, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "The neurologist who would oversee the treatment told the court that while Charlie was in the \"terminal stage\" of his illness, treating him would be compassionate.

{"article": "Ahead of the vote, here are seven things you need to know about the West African country - once hailed as a model of stability. The economy has boomed in recent years and Ivory Coast is the world's biggest exporter of cocoa, producing around 40% of the planet's beans used to manufacture chocolate. But this year, it also overtook India as the leading exporter of cashew nuts. Cocoa transformed Ivory Coast into the \"Paris of Africa\" as it was called in the 1970s and 1980s, until a slump in cocoa prices dampened the \"Ivorian miracle\". President Alassane Ouattara, who took office in May 2011, wanted to diversify the economy. Agriculture is still the backbone, but it includes bananas, rubber and palm oil too. The last elections in 2010 sparked five months of violence when former President Laurent Gbagbo refused to step down. More than 3,000 people were killed in some of the most brutal violence the country has ever seen. President Ouattara has been accused of one-sided justice after hundreds of Mr Gbagbo's supporters were imprisoned but very few from his side were even arrested - despite the UN and international human rights organisations saying both sides committed atrocities. No more \"nids de poules\" on the country's major roads. The French call potholes \"chicken nests\". The government says it has built 1,000km (620 miles) of new roads since it has been in power and rehabilitated another 20,000km throughout Ivory Coast. It is promising to build 1,200km more if re-elected. There were 10, now there are seven. A former finance minister, Mamadou Koulibaly, and former foreign minister, Amara Essy, dropped out saying the elections would not be free and fair. The latest, former prime minister Charles Konan Banny, pulled out on Friday, with the same complaint. That leaves another former prime minister - Pascal Affi N'Guessan, leader of Laurent Gbagbo's former party - as Mr Ouattara's main rival. Mr Ouattara is the eldest at 73, while independent candidate Claire Jacqueline Kouangoua, one of only two women running, is the youngest at 44. Mr Affi N'Guessan, the main opposition candidate, is using the same slogan that France's Francois Hollande did in his last campaign , \"Le changement maintenant\", meaning \"Change now\", which is ironic considering how unpopular Mr Hollande is now in France. Mr Ouattara, known to his supporters as \"Ado\" because of his initials, has chosen to use \"Avec Ado, reussir ensemble\", meaning \"With Ado, succeed together\". This is also interesting because one of the main criticisms of President Ouattara has been his lack of focus on reconciliation since the crisis. The campaign theme of \"togetherness\" is clearly supposed to address this. Music has always played a role in Ivory Coast politics. Alpha Blondy, the country's undisputed king of reggae, began singing about war and fighting in the country as early as 1998. In 2010, he openly backed former President Laurent Gbagbo, giving a free concert in Abidjan. His main reggae rival, Tiken Jah Fakoly who sang anti-Gbagbo songs, had to go into exile and has decided to stay in Mali. And this election is no different when it comes to music and the main candidates have their songs. Mr N'Guessan's talks about \"the fighters\" being \"tired\" and how they were all the \"victims of the political violence\" but Affi N'Guessan is their man. Mr Ouattara's focuses instead on what the government has done for the economy, singing: \"With Ado, Ivory Coast wins.\" The Elephants are the pride of Ivory Coast, and while football is a game and has nothing to do with politics, we all know that's not true. Didier Drogba has been attributed with single-handedly putting an end to violence that was raging in the country in 2005 when he fell to his knees on national television and asked fighters to lay down their arms. A week later they did. This year Drogba, along with his former teammates and other international Ivorian sport stars, like sprinter Murielle Ahoure, have a new message for voters. \"Election c pas gnaga\".

{"article": "This one-street market town, sitting on the border of the Kavre and Sindhupalchok districts towards the border with Tibet, was packed full of Saturday shoppers when the quake hit. Now it is quiet. Birds sing, villagers try to move rubble with their hands and, overhead, the hum of high-flying aid helicopters punctuates the air. \"They are flying in the sky, but no-one has come up to now,\" says Prakash Bhandari, who works as a waiter in Kathmandu but returned to see if he could help his home village. \"We are suffering. What to do?\" he asks. Despite having one of the largest casualty figures from Saturday's earthquake, this area has received little or no aid. Villagers say they need tents and food, and that they are worried about disease. They dug up the bodies of the people they knew with their bare hands. But Saturday was a busy shopping day and they think that there are many more people under the rubble that they do not know. \"We will die if there's no help from the government and other organisations,\" says Dhan Bahadur Shresthra who used to run the local pharmacy and was helping patients when the quake struck. \"I worked as a medic in the army for 25 years so I know that if we don't have clean water or food to eat, then there could be an epidemic,\" he says. Further up the hill, villagers have taken matters into their own hands. In a hamlet that is now nothing more than mounds of red earth and wood, 22-year-old Anjali Majhi has hired an excavator to search for the body of her two-year-old daughter. Just before the quake hit, Ms Majhi had shouted at her daughter for bothering her and had sent her off to play with neighbours. Now she says she will not rest until she can give her a proper funeral. \"We've found all the adults who died here and we've given them the last rites. I hope I can do the same for my daughter, otherwise I'll never forgive myself,\" she says. But Ms Majhi is not sure whether she will find her child. The owner of the excavator did not charge her to hire it, but he did make her pay for the fuel. It is running out now and she cannot afford to buy another tank. A few hundred metres away, across terraces of corn, men who have shaved their heads in mourning carry two bodies, shrouded in white, down to the river for cremation. These were found earlier in the day after another group of villagers hired the excavator for a few hours. It is the only help this area has seen since the quake ripped their lives apart. Then, out of nowhere, a bus arrives carrying dozens of Nepali volunteers. They are followers of the self-styled guru Master Godangel who stands at the roadside in robes of white and garlands of flowers and promises to help with food and shelter. \"I feel really upset about this government, I feel really, really upset,\" he says. \"It's a corrupt government. I'm not blaming them, but the way that they work is really very traumatic, very sad. \"They've received billions of dollars in international aid, but they're not doing anything.\" Back up the hill, the fuel tank of the excavator is almost empty so its driver finishes for the day. As the rain starts to fall, the only place that Ms Majhi can take shelter is with her animals. \"We still have hope,\" she says. \"Helicopters are flying overhead.

{"article": "The dangers of allowing ungoverned space, where militant groups have launched attacks on neighbouring Israel, ought to have been obvious to anybody in Cairo, but it was only the killing of 16 of their border guards on Sunday that finally prompted action. The inhabitants of the Sinai Peninsula, notably some of its Bedouin tribes, are a heavily armed force that, it would seem, the military rulers of Egypt who had recently stood down were reluctant to challenge. Now, in one of those bitter paradoxes of power in the Middle East, it has fallen to Mohammed Morsi, the recently elected president from the Muslim Brotherhood to clamp down on militants who claim Islamic legitimacy for their attacks. It might be argued that Mr Morsi is the ideal man to take these wayward tribes in hand - since he has both a democratic mandate and some degree of backing from Egypt's religious establishment. There is also a good deal of cynicism in Cairo about the tribes' professed religious motivations, since they are also widely believed to be involved in smuggling of drugs, weapons, and people. Even so, Tuesday's raid on Touma, close to the Gaza Strip on the Mediterranean Sea, may indicate the opening of a bloody new chapter for Sinai. The raid, in which helicopters fired missiles into the township, had an aspect of communal punishment about it, or reprisal for Sunday's loss of border guards. Inevitably there will be some who want revenge against the security forces. Since the armed bands on the peninsula are thought to possess hundreds of light weapons, as well as technicals (pick-up trucks mounting heavy machine guns), and multiple rocket launchers they have considerable ability to cause trouble. The bombing of several hotels in Sharm el-Sheikh in 2005 claimed 84 lives was blamed by security officials on elements within the same Bedouin tribes, claiming ties with al-Qaeda. It underlines the degree to which the country's Red Sea tourist industry is vulnerable to reprisals. More recently the Israelis have accused the same groups of several deadly attacks along their border with Egypt. These created great tension in an area that had been peaceful for decades, and prompted the Israelis to start building a barrier through the desert in an attempt to prevent more infiltration. Today the Israelis have reacted with satisfaction to the new security crackdown, and have given their agreement to military reinforcements going into Sinai (as it required under the 1979 peace treaty between the two countries that sought to de-militarise the peninsula). Mr Morsi meanwhile faces the accusation that has been used in the past against those who have taken similar measures, of acting as Israel's policeman. The shooting of so many Egyptian soldiers at the weekend has allowed the president to present this action as a response to a challenge to national authority rather than an attack on Israel.

The dinosaur's missing foot was found at the beach by palaeontology student, Sam Davies, of Bridgend, at the beginning of this month. \"My first reaction was that I was very lucky,\" he said. The fossilised skeleton of the theropod - a distant cousin of the giant Tyrannosaurus rex - went on display at the National Museum Cardiff's main hall in June after it was found by fossil-hunting brothers Nick and Rob Hanigan. Mr Davies, who studies at the University of Portsmouth, visited Lavernock, near Penarth, after his tutor told him its cliffs were rich with fossils. He arrived only hours after a cliff fall had exposed the fossil and before it could be washed away by the tide. \"It was pure luck that I found it.

{"article": "Their lab-based work suggests there is a biological step that can restore normality and stop cells replicating out of control. When the US researchers added molecules called microRNAs, it put the brakes on cancer, Nature Cell Biology reports. Although the early tests in a dish look promising, it is unclear whether it will help treat people with cancer. The Mayo Clinic researchers are hopeful that the new mechanism they have found could apply to all types of cancer. It brings together two strands of science - cell adhesion and microRNA (miRNA) biology - that, until now, had not been linked. Scientists had thought adhesion molecules were simply the glue that holds cells together. But then others found they might have signalling roles. The Mayo Clinic work shows adhesion molecules connect cells and signal via miRNAs to control cell growth. If this becomes deregulated it can drive cancer. But replenishing cells with miRNAs can remedy this. Lead researcher Dr Panos Anastasiadis said: \"By administering the affected miRNAs in cancer cells to restore their normal levels, we should be able to re-establish the brakes and restore normal cell function. \"Initial experiments in some aggressive types of cancer are indeed very promising.\" Henry Scowcroft, Cancer Research UK's senior science information manager, said: \"This important study solves a long-standing biological mystery, but we mustn't get ahead of ourselves. \"There's a long way to go before we know whether these findings, in cells grown in a laboratory, will help treat people with cancer.

But the Tories said Labour's attacks were \"a massive own goal\". They said the Labour-led Welsh government had overseen increases in class sizes in Wales. Mr Corbyn, who insisted on Thursday that he could defy the polls and \"change the direction\" of the election, has used Labour analysis of Department for Education figures to focus on education. He said: \"The prime minister herself has said that super-sized classes are proof of a school system in a crisis. \"And that's what we've got on the Tories' watch. \"School leaders and teachers have said Tory cuts to school budgets will mean class sizes will be forced to grow even larger.

He told supporters: \"500,000 children in England - half a million children - are now being taught in super-sized classes of over 36\". The half a million figure is for class sizes of 31 - 34. A Labour spokesman said Mr Corbyn had mixed the figures up. A Conservative spokeswoman dismissed Mr Corbyn's comments and pointed out that the number of infants in large classes had risen by 18% in three years in Wales. \"Of course we are not complacent about the situation in England,\" she added. \"There is more to do and that's why we are spending a record amount on schools - something we can afford to do because of our careful management of the nation's finances.\" Elsewhere on the campaign trail on Friday, Mr Farron will challenge Tory MPs who supported staying in the EU to oppose a so-called hard Brexit.

Russian Yurchikhin and American Nyberg have both been into space before. Italian Parmitano is a first-timer. They arrived at the orbiting platform five hours and 46 minutes later. Their Soyuz capsule was using a new flight profile that dramatically reduces the rendezvous time from the traditional two days. It is technically more difficult and requires some very precise orbital adjustments, but it is deemed to be easier on the crew because it means they do not have to spend so long inside their cramped vehicle. Leak and pressure checks were conducted following docking at the station, with a hatch opening at 04:14 GMT. The trio, whose designation is Expedition 36, were greeted with hugs and smiles by the three individuals already on the ISS - Russians Pavel Vinogradov and Alexander Misurkin, and American Chris Cassidy. The new crew members will be given a week of light duties in which to acclimatise to their weightless surroundings. Work will then begin in earnest. Luca Parmitano's participation in this expedition is particularly notable. At 36, he is the youngest person to get a long-duration (six months) stay on the station. He is also the first of the European Space Agency's (Esa) new intake of astronauts to get a flight assignment. Selected in 2009, the former fighter pilot has a packed schedule ahead of him. ISS crews are now completing about 70 hours a week of science, conducting experiments that exploit the unique microgravity environment on the platform. Parmitano has a package of specific European activities to work through, which cover fields as diverse as fluid physics and materials science. The Italian will see all of the vehicles now used to service the station come and go during his time in orbit, including possibly the new Cygnus freighter which is made in part in the Italian city of Turin. He is also scheduled to make two spacewalks to work on the exterior of the platform. \"I've dreamt of doing that. Being an astronaut is about walking in space. For me, they are one and the same thing,\" he told BBC News. One of the spacewalks will help prepare the ISS for the arrival of Russia's big science laboratory, which will grow the 420-tonne complex still further. The lab will come up with Europe's major robotic contribution to the platform - a large arm that is able to move around the station to conduct work wherever it is needed. Born in the Sicilian town of Paterno, Parmitano expects to bring a strong Italian flavour to his stay in orbit - literally. Italian chefs have prepared a range of special astronaut foods for him, including lasagne and risotto. These will be delivered to the ISS in the coming weeks on the European robotic freighter Albert Einstein. Fyodor Yurchikhin, Karen Nyberg and Luca Parmitano are due back on Earth on 10 November.

{"article": "Belfast-based UTV says it is in talks which could lead to its TV business in Northern Ireland being sold. If the deal goes through, STV would be the last Channel 3 broadcaster outside ITVplc's control. Like STV, up until now UTV has guarded its independence and identity fiercely. Originally the Channel 3 network was a federation of regional franchisees. Between 1993 and 2004, the regional stations based in England and Wales - including Border TV which serves southern Scotland - gradually consolidated into one company through a series of takeovers and mergers. At the end of the process, the company was named ITVplc. Later ITVplc also acquired Channel Television in the Channel Islands leaving UTV and STV as the only independent companies in the network. Parent company UTV Media - which also owns several radio stations - said this morning it was in talks which could lead to the sale of its television business. It had already been widely reported that ITVplc was the potential buyer. Inevitably, there is bound to be renewed speculation over STV's future independence if UTV comes into ITV's ownership. However industry watchers point out that STV has had to live with this sort of speculation for 20 years and still managed to retain its independence - sometimes against the odds. The relationship between STV and ITVplc would not be directly affected by any takeover of ITV by UTV. Three years ago, STV entered into a new affiliation deal with ITVplc which led to a new, friendly relationship between the two companies. Previously it had become strained after STV started dropping popular network programmes.

{"article": "Greece is now part way through its third eurozone bailout programme, worth up to 86bn euros (\u00c2\u00a374bn). The programme has encountered repeated delays as the lenders monitor compliance with policy conditions. Technical officials are expected to return to Athens soon to complete the negotiations. The \"in principle\" deal, as European Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici called it, was agreed at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Malta. The main elements in the latest agreement are commitments to reduce spending on pensions from 2019 and to collect more income tax from 2020 by lowering the tax-free threshold. Together the two measures are intended to improve the Greek government's finances by the equivalent of 2% of the country's economic activity, or GDP. To sweeten a pill that will be unpopular in Greece, the other eurozone countries agreed that Athens would be able take other measures to stimulate the economy, if the government finances perform better than expected. The next step is that technical experts from three European institutions and the IMF will return to Athens to try to negotiate the remaining details. The Dutch Finance Minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, who chairs eurozone ministers' meetings, called for them to put the last dots on the i's and reach a full agreement as soon as possible at staff level - that's the staff of the institutions involved in monitoring the programme. That is needed before there is political decision to make that delayed payment. Once there is a staff agreement, Mr Dijsselbloem said that the Eurogroup ministers would also look at the targets Greece would need to aim for in the government finances after the last bailout payments are made (due in 2018) and the question of debt sustainability - which means debt relief beyond what the eurozone has already provided. Debt relief previously has been in the form of reduced interest rates and longer payment periods, rather than reducing the amount of the principal sum that must ultimately be repaid. Further debt relief is likely to be in a similar form. Eurozone ministers have said it many times and it's politically more difficult for them with domestic political audiences if they were to explicitly write off a chunk of what they have lent. The International Monetary Fund has long argued that Greece needs more debt relief. That has been behind its reluctance to contribute financially to the third bailout. (It did chip in to the first two). Its involvement in the third so far is as an adviser and monitor of Greek performance. The rest of the eurozone, but especially Germany, would like the IMF to put some money in. That's not so much for the sake of reducing the eurozone contribution as for the better credibility they think the programme would have if the IMF did stump up some money. But IMF staff are so far unwilling to even recommend it to their board, which is made up of representatives of the agency's member countries. After the Malta meeting, IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said: \"We are at a point where we think there are good prospects for successfully concluding discussions on these outstanding policy issues during the next mission to Athens. \"Such an agreement on policies will have to be followed by discussions with euro-area countries to ensure satisfactory assurances on a credible strategy to restore debt sustainability, before a programme is presented to the IMF executive board.\" The key deadline for the next instalment from the eurozone is July. Greece needs additional funds for debt payments that fall due. In Athens, the Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said: \"The Greek economy is ready to leave the crisis behind it.\" But there is a lot of scepticism about that. Hugo Dixon of BreakingViews says that the current discussion will only buy Greece some more time, until mid-2018. Thereafter, he argues, Greece will probably need a fourth bailout.", "abstract": "Eurozone finance ministers say they have agreed with Greece the main elements of a deal to unlock a delayed bailout payment.", "candidate": "Eurozone finance ministers have agreed a preliminary deal to release the next instalment of Greece's bailout.", "doc_id": 1117, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "The \"in principle\" deal, as European Economic Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici called it, was agreed at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers in Malta.", "explanation": "the summary info about finance ministers agreeing to a deal is factually correct and supported by the source text", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

{"article": "People holding candles and torches observed a minute's silence at the start of the main event in Copenhagen. Two people were killed and five police were injured in attacks on a free speech debate and a synagogue. The gunman was later shot dead by police. He did not appear to be part of a wider terror cell, Denmark's PM said. Earlier on Monday, two men were charged with providing and disposing of the weapon used in the attacks and helping the gunman to hide. The gunman was named by local media as Omar El-Hussein. The national flag flew at half-mast on official buildings across the capital on Monday. Floral tributes have been placed by mourners at the site of the two attacks. Some also put flowers at the place where police shot the suspect dead. One told Danish TV2: \"I did it because I am Muslim and because I knew him.\" As dusk fell on Monday a vast crowd gathered for the Copenhagen event, held on a square near the cultural centre where one of the attacks took place. A police spokesman said the crowds numbered about 30,000. Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt told the audience that an attack on the Jews of Denmark \"is an attack on Denmark, on all of us\". She also again vowed that Denmark was determined to safeguard its values. The prime minister earlier told a news conference the attacker was a Danish-born man aged 22. \"He was known by the police for several criminal acts, including severe violence, and he was also known to be linked to a criminal gang in Copenhagen. \" \"But I want to also make very clear that we have no indication at this stage that he was part of a cell.\" Omar El-Hussein: homegrown radical . The two suspects being held by police appeared in a closed custody hearing on Monday. Michael Juul Eriksen, a defence lawyer for one of them, said they denied the charges. Omar El-Hussein was released from prison two weeks before the attacks after serving a sentence for grievous bodily harm. Danish intelligence chief Jens Madsen acknowledged that El-Hussein had been \"on the radar\" of his services. Mr Madsen said investigators were working on the theory that he could have been inspired by the shootings in Paris last month. The attacks on the Charlie Hebdo magazine, a kosher supermarket and a policewoman claimed 17 lives. In the first of the two shootings on Saturday, at a free-speech debate in the east of the city, film director Finn Norgaard, 55, was killed. In an audio recording of the shooting, the gunman can be heard interrupting the debate and firing dozens of shots. Hours later, Dan Uzan, a 37-year-old long-time member of the Copenhagen synagogue, was shot dead while on security duty outside the building. Eighty people were celebrating a girl's bat mitzvah, or coming of age, in a hall behind the synagogue at the time. The gunman fled by car but was traced by police to the city's Norrebro district. He opened fire when confronted and was fatally shot by officers. In another development, controversial cartoonist Lars Vilks - who believes he was probably a target of one of the attacks - says he has gone into hiding. He told Channel 4 News he was now in a \"secret place\". Finn Noergaard, 55, was struck in the chest by a bullet at the free speech debate. The documentary film-maker had a keen interest in the problems faced by the offspring of migrant communities. His friend Malene Trock told Berlinske daily he was \"open-minded\" and \"cosmopolitan\". Producer Torben Larsen is quoted by the AP news agency as saying Mr Noergaard was \"a very generous and warm person\". Dan Uzan, 37, was shot dead while standing guard at a Copenhagen synagogue.

{"article": "Some 670 arts organisations will receive annual grants worth a total of \u00a3340m per year. Three quarters of those have had their funding frozen. Among the losers is the English National Opera which has a funding cut close to 30%. Here, some of the other winners and losers reflect on their positions. The news that Richmond's Orange Tree Theatre had lost all of its funding came on new artistic director Paul Miller's first official day in the job. The funding represents almost a quarter of the theatre's income. \"I think the big, national contradictory pressures that are on the Arts Council were just so great that something had to give - and on that occasion it was us,\" Mr Miller told the BBC. \"I think there is an element of rebalancing out of London. Perhaps there was a perception about the kind of work that the Orange Tree was doing that was not easy to shift. \"Once upon a time, the Orange Tree was a fledgling start-up company that had its first Arts Council funding. For new younger companies to get into the system, it means that existing organisations cannot simply take for granted that they will continue to be regularly funded.\" He said talks with the Arts Council would continue while until he developed a new business model. \"There are still many ways in which we can continue to take wonderful theatre in our lovely space. We just have to find a financially different way of doing it.\" Salford's The Lowry arts centre had a 22% funding drop to \u00a3800,000 per year. But it also received a \u00a33m capital grant from the Arts Council and a \u00a31 million private donation - the largest in its 14-year history. \"It's a mixed result for us but one that we're broadly pleased with,\" said chief executive Julia Fawcett. The Arts Council funding currently represents about 6% of The Lowry's total budget, and this will drop to about 4% from 2015. \"It means we'll have to recalibrate, refocus and work harder,\" said Ms Fawcett. She didn't see \"too many seismic shifts\" in the way funding had changed outside the capital. \"The shift out of London is so marginal it hardly bears attention. It does look as if London-based organisations have taken a cut but it's at the margins. \"There's been some degree of restoration for some of our significant touring companies - like Birmingham Royal Ballet and Opera North.\" Unicorn Theatre, which specialises in arts for young people, had a 30% boost taking its annual grant to \u00a31.3m from April. \"Children's theatre has come a long way since the Unicorn was founded in 1947 and it's a terrific milestone to be recognised in this funding round as being equally important to the cultural life of the nation as any of the country's leading theatres,\" said artist director Purni Morell. \"We're absolutely committed to making this vital public investment count, not just for the Unicorn but for the whole of children's theatre in the UK, as we embark on an ambitious programme of commissions, productions, tours and talent development. As ever, working with some of the best artists around and continuing to push expectations of what can be achieved in children's arts ever higher.\" Create, which commissions art in public spaces, is one of the 46 new organisations to receive Arts Council funding. Primarily working in east London, it is launching its first project outside of London - an artist-designed playground in the east end of Glasgow. Hadrian Garrard, director of Create, said: \"It's now becoming more broadly acknowledged that publically-funded arts organisations need to do more to reach different demographics. We see ourselves as emerging leaders in how to do this well and this is a great acknowledgment of that by the Arts Council. \"It will allow us to produce more ambitious projects involving communities in east London and other cities across the UK.

The parent company of the bank plans to float the Glasgow-based lender in Australia later this year. Chancellor George Osborne announced he was phasing out the bank levy. He also announced plans to introduce an 8% surcharge on bank profits, in addition to corporation tax. That knocked share prices of smaller UK banks which are already traded. A bank analyst at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia calculated that would knock A$425m off its valuation, and suggested that could push National Australia Bank (NAB) to sell off a larger stake in order to meet its target for raising capital. A spokesman for the NAB was reported by the Melbourne Herald Sun saying the move would have no impact on the parent bank's earnings. A spokesman in Glasgow for Clydesdale Bank, which includes the Yorkshire Bank brand, declined to comment. Clydesdale Bank is seen at the Melbourne headquarters and in the Australian media as a drag on NAB, having amassed a large portfolio of bad property loans, and the high costs of redress for mis-selling financial products. The new NAB chief executive, Andrew Thorburn, has made it a priority to split Clydesdale, handing up to 80% of it to NAB investors and selling the remainder on London and Australian exchanges.

After installing the bed at Christie's, Emin told BBC News arts correspondent Tim Masters what it still means to her 16 years on. It feels different knowing that it's going to leave. Before, when I've installed it, there is a level of nostalgia each time. But this time I was really quite sad because I don't know where it's going. It's quite scary, it's out of my control completely. Not that I'm a giant control freak. But I really care about the bed, and I really love it. I realise being here today how much it means. It's always meant a lot to me, but I didn't realise how passionate I was about it. The best possible result is that an amazing benefactor buys it and then donates it to a museum. I have no idea where it's going to end up - or how much anyone is going to pay for it. There's never been anything like it for sale in an art auction before. All the duvets were wrapped up, and everything was in airtight containers. It looked like a crime scene or a scientific project. Today when I took the duvet out, it was flat. And when I threw it on the bed, it didn't look right. So I fluffed it up, and it still didn't look right. So I actually made the bed and got in and pushed the cover back so it had that natural feeling that a body has been into it. It is strange because it still has that same smell that it had 16 years ago. Obviously the stains and everything else are touching me, and it's like being touched by a ghost of yourself. My American friends came to see me installing it this morning, and they saw the mattress and they went: \"Tracey!\" I think people are so used to seeing it as an image that they forget that it's real. When they see it for real, it still evokes these feelings inside them because you can see the trace of a human being in there. It's like the self-portrait of someone that's gone. It's like a time capsule, and a lot of people relate to that in some way. Pretty good. Especially being a woman and being part of art history. I'm pleased about that. If I never do anything else great and seminal again, like the bed, I've done it. And that makes me happy. Now I can just get on with my life and do what's really important to me - and that's making art.

The UKIP manifesto for May's assembly election, launched in Newport on Friday, includes a photo on the page outlining local government policy. \"The policies and principles on which UKIP is based are far from the ideals of William Gladstone,\" Mr Francis said. \"Gladstone was an internationalist and profoundly believed that the 'sanctity of life in the hill villages of Afghanistan among the winter snows are as inviolable in the eye of Almighty God as can be your own'. \"That is to say he felt that the unity of human beings throughout the world was vitally important and 'not limited by the shores of this island.''

A spokesman added: \"UKIP is a party founded on the principles of liberty and in particular self-governance and the protection of personal freedoms and is closest ideologically to the old Liberal Party that Gladstone joined as a Peelite. \"Gladstone was a great orator and believed strongly in holding public meetings, something that UKIP also firmly adheres to, and was a great advocate of preserving the UK's dominion. \"In fact, you would be hard pressed to find a modern day party more closely related to the principles of Gladstonian liberalism than UKIP. \"It's a shame that the people overseeing this great public library do not seem to understand anything about the politics of the great man who founded it.\"", "abstract": "A Flintshire library dedicated to 19th Century Liberal Prime Minister William Gladstone has complained to UKIP after the party used a photo of it in its Welsh manifesto.", "candidate": "A library founded by William Gladstone has criticised UKIP for using a photo of him on its assembly election manifesto page.", "doc_id": 1367, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "Gladstone's Library in Hawarden said it had not been asked for permission.", "explanation": "In a source text it states UKIP used the photo without permission on their election Manifesto then implies Gladstones support for their cause, which they claim is not the case and it devalues his memory.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}
{"article": "A species of midge was able to release large volumes of nutrients into the soil, changing the way native species had lived and evolved, a UK team found. They added the species was well-suited to thrive in the extreme conditions. Details of the research were presented at the British Ecological Society's annual meeting in Birmingham. A team from the British Antarctic Survey said the invasive species, the non-biting midge Eretmoptera murphyi, effectively removed one of the brakes on the way that the native community had developed. \"In terms of function, their job is litter turnover - they help things decay in the soil - and the population density of this thing in the area where it has been introduced is responsible for more litter turnover than the community that was already there,\" explained co-presenter of the research Peter Convey, of the British Antarctic Survey. \"So basically it is bringing a function into an ecosystem that is not very active already. In principle, it can be a fundamental change in the way that ecosystem works.\" Speaking to BBC News before the presentation, Prof Convey warned: \"If you widen [this issue] beyond this particular species then probably the biggest risk is that we could drive locally or generally extinct some of the unique species that already exist in part of the Antarctic.\" He said that in a different project, the team had been looking at the tiny flies' evolution. \"Its native home is sub-Antarctica in South Georgia, and it has been on [the island] for several tens of millions of years. \"South Georgia is its own tectonic plate that has been moving away from South America for 30 or 40 million years. \"The Antarctic peninsula is another tectonic plate of a similar sort, and there are things on there that have got a similar multi-million, if not multi-tens of million-year histories.\" But Prof Convey explained that just because the two areas were located in a similar region, it did not mean the transfer of species between them did not have lasting consequences. \"You are looking at almost distinct bio-geographic regions, which have got their own distinct biodiversity. \"So if you transfer things between them - you have things like this fly that is pre-adapted - you also bring potentially new functions into the ecosystem.\" The threat of introducing a growing number of invasive species into the Antarctic's long-isolated ecosystems is increasing; the team highlighted that about 5,000 scientific staff and 30,000 tourists were visiting the continent each year. Prof Convey said: \"When people visit the Antarctic - whether that be tourists or people like me - we stop in the sub-Antarctic first, then we go on. So the biggest perceived risk at the moment is that people get a lot of mud on their boots, and then two days later you are in the South Orkney Islands, mud drops off boots - so the things are able to colonise the area. \"And then another day later, the ship reaches Elephant Island, which is at the tip of Antarctic peninsula, and then another day later it has got half-way down the peninsula. So you have got this potential step-carrying of things down the peninsula.\" Because species like the midge had the physiological characteristics to survive \"all the way down the peninsula\", it had the potential to have a wide and lasting impact, he observed. \"If we are not careful about the way we move around then we could be a very good carrying vector.\"", "abstract": "An invasive species has the potential to drastically alter Antarctic ecosystems that have been isolated for millions of years, research suggests.", "candidate": "An invasive species of tiny fly has had a \"fundamental change\" in the Antarctic ecosystem, scientists say.", "doc_id": 1277, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "In principle, it can be a fundamental change in the way that ecosystem works.", "explanation": "The source text does state that the midge is invasive and is a tiny fly, as well as the fundamental change quote and the antarctic location.

{"article": "It puts new, lower limits on the size of each country's nuclear arsenal, and updates the verification mechanism. There are limits on warheads and on launchers, which must be implemented within seven years of the treaty's entry into force. Warheads: Under the New Start treaty each side is allowed a maximum of 1,550 warheads. This is about 30% lower than the figure of 2,200 that each side was meant to reach by 2012 under the Start treaty (as revised in the 2002 Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty). Launchers: Each country is allowed, in total, no more than 700 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear arms. Another 100 are allowed if they are not operationally deployed - for example, missiles removed from a sub undergoing a long-term overhaul. The new limit on delivery systems is less than half the ceiling of 1,600 specified in the original Start treaty. Not as dramatic as they might appear. The rules for counting warheads contain a big loophole. While each warhead on a ballistic missile is counted as one warhead, a heavy bomber is counted as carrying \"one warhead\" even though it may carry (in the case of a US B-52) up to 20 of them. According to the Arms Control Association, a pro-disarmament pressure group, the US could theoretically meet the new limits by cutting just 100 warheads, while Russia would only need to cut 190. In addition, the agreed ceilings refer to deployed warheads, not to warheads in storage. A warhead could, in theory, be put into storage, and then redeployed when needed. The cuts in launchers are also, in practice, not all that challenging. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists estimates that Russia currently has 566 - well under the permitted ceiling of 700. It estimates that the US has 798, necessitating a cut of about 12%. Supporters of the deal say that while it does not make big cuts, it is a useful confidence-building measure, which could pave the way for further nuclear deals with Russia. They say it also signals to the rest of the world that the US and Russia are not ignoring their commitment under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to progressively disarm. The important difference, according to the Arms Control Association, is that each side will now be able to carry out on-site inspections to verify how many warheads a missile is carrying. Together with satellite imagery, this should give an accurate picture of the other country's nuclear strength. Some other forms of verification will cease. Yes, it says that both sides can engage in \"limited\" missile defence. Russia has warned that it will withdraw from the treaty if a future US missile defence shield weakens its nuclear deterrent. The US Senate ratified it on 22 December, after much delay, so now all it needs is Russia's final approval. Russia's parliament, the Duma, is expected to ratify it - and the process may begin on 24 December. The US wants further cuts in strategic nuclear arms, but is also keen to negotiate a reduction in Russia's short-range nuclear missile arsenal.

{"article": "The Department for Transport predicted a \"decline in network performance\" once one in four cars become driverless. However, should driverless vehicles make up between 50% and 75% of cars, DfT researchers say they will reduce congestion. The average time spent delayed on city roads at rush hour will fall by 12.4% when 25% of vehicles are driverless. The DfT said early models of the vehicles acted more cautiously and the result could be a \"potential decrease in effective capacity\" on motorways and A roads. But as more people adopted the technology and it became common place on the country's road network, the study found that congestion could be cut by 40%. Steve Gooding, director of motoring research charity the RAC Foundation, said: \"There's a prize to be had in terms of swifter, safer journeys, but the transition to that world will be challenging. \"There are around 32 million conventional cars on the UK's roads - as driverless cars come in, traffic flow could initially get worse rather than better, potentially for many years. \"Much will depend on how an autonomous car's parameters are set and just how defensively these vehicles will be programmed to drive.\" The study used software to map out the effects of the cars on the road network. The DfT said the report was the first step into more trials and researching, ensuring driverless cares are \"safe and beneficial for all\". Transport minister John Hayes said: \"This exciting and extensive study shows that driverless cars could vastly improve the flow of traffic in our towns and cities, offering huge benefits to motorists including reduced delays and more reliable journey times.\" Ministers are also planning to extend existing insurance cover to driverless vehicles, covering individuals when they are driving and when they have handed over control to the computer. In the event of a crash caused by the technology, a government consultation document suggests the driver and anyone else affected should be able to claim from the insurer and, in turn, the insurer would be able to claim compensation from the manufacturer.

A BBC correspondent who has flown into Kunduz has heard gunfire and artillery exchanges not far from its centre. Afghan officials say foreign jihadists trained by the Islamic State (IS) group are fighting alongside the Taliban. Provincial governor Mohammed Omer Safi told the BBC that the bodies of 18 foreign fighters, including three Chechen women, had been found. Security forces and Taliban have been involved in a stand-off for about a week after the insurgents launched an offensive on Kunduz at the end of April. The insurgents are currently said to be massed in the Gul Tepa district on the southern outskirts of the city. This is the first positive confirmation by a senior government official that Islamic State is operating alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan. Until now, particularly in the south of the country, IS fighters have often clashed with the Taliban. But the governor said that the battle for the north is different, and here IS fighters are \"supporting the Taliban, training the Taliban, trying to build the capacity of the Taliban for a bigger fight\". And, he said, they were more violent because they wanted to die in battle as martyrs. As well as from Afghanistan's immediate northern neighbours, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan, the dead came from Chechnya and Turkey. They were wearing black headbands marked with the same Islamic verses used by IS in Syria and Iraq. Battle heralds militant tie-up . Correspondents say the advance is the most serious threat to a provincial capital in years. Afghan army and police are involved in the fighting but there is no substantial help from foreign troops. The BBC's David Loyn in Kunduz says Afghan forces are thinly spread in this region, and as well as this determined assault on Kunduz the Taliban and their allies have also attacked remote outposts in the mountains of Badakhshan further east. Reports said at least 13 police were killed in the attacks. Governor Safi said the Afghan forces in Kunduz did not have enough air power and their helicopters lacked the armaments they should have. Only a few thousand Nato troops remain in the country, largely in training roles, after their combat mission ended in December. They have turned down several requests to assist with air strikes. People displaced by the fighting are spread across the city and rural areas of the province of Kunduz. The prolonged fighting could lead to a bigger problem if there is a failure to bring in the harvest this month, our correspondent says. Kunduz supplies half of Afghanistan's rice crop, so delays could have a far-reaching impact, he adds.

Ms Lockhart also confirmed a DUP statement which said she had a relative in the non-domestic scheme. In December, Sinn F\u00e9in said PAC committee member Michelle Gildernew MLA had a brother in the domestic scheme. Mrs Gildernew was absent from the committee on Wednesday. The PAC has been running an investigation into the handling of the non-domestic RHI for several months. The green energy scheme was intended to increase the creation of heat from renewable sources. However, businesses were receiving more in subsidies than they were paying for renewable fuel and the scheme became majorly oversubscribed. The fallout from the scandal surrounding the scheme, which is approximately \u00a3490m over budget, resulted in the collapse of Stormont's institutions and the calling of snap elections on 2 March. Mrs Lockhart told the committee on Wednesday her brother-in-law had been a recipient of the heat subsidy since 2014, but she had been unaware of that fact until January 2017. She was responding to a request from UUP MLA and committee chair Robin Swann for any committee member with an interest in the scheme to declare it. Mrs Lockhart said as well as being unaware of her relative's involvement with RHI, she did not \"help or assist with the application process\". \"My mother and father have poultry farms and do not have RHI and I can let any journalist see my bank statements and they will see there's no benefit from RHI,\" she said. Mrs Lockhart said it would be useful to know whether any committee member absent from today's meeting had any interest in the RHI scheme. The chairman said he would ask the committee clerk to write to all its members seeking the information which would be circulated to all the other members. DUP MLA Trevor Clarke asked whether this would cover any relative including one \"three times removed\". Mr Swann went on to thank members for their work on the inquiry.

For Sunday, willow artist Woody Fox has created a 2.1m (7ft) unicorn sculpture for the Crawick Multiverse art project in Dumfries and Galloway. VisitScotland is also encouraging people to \"spot\" unicorns elsewhere in Scotland. Carvings and sculptures of unicorns can be found on historic buildings, such as the National War Museum at Edinburgh Castle. A tapestry called, Mystic Hunt of the Unicorn, hangs in Stirling Castle and a unicorn is a feature of a fountain in the courtyard at Linlithgow Palace. On the Black Isle in the Highlands, The Stables in Cromarty has a large unicorn sculpture. The unicorn has been a Scottish heraldic symbol since the 12th Century when it was used on an early form of the Scottish coat of arms by William I. Reasons for the appearance of a unicorn include a theory that narwhal, a whale with long tusks protruding from their heads, were seen in Scottish waters after straying from their usual range in the Arctic. Unicorns were also written about by the ancient Celts, Persians, Romans and Greeks, and were often described as an elegant white horse-like creature with a single horn capable of magical properties.

{"article": "An assessment of how much each Scottish firm will pay in non-domestic rates is under way, to take effect from April. Tory leader Ruth Davidson has written to Nicola Sturgeon calling for an \"urgent review\" of the process. The first minister has said all businesses will have the chance to appeal the final valuations. And she said that 100,000 small firms would be lifted out of having to pay rates altogether via the small business bonus scheme, claiming Scotland has \"the most competitive business rates regime in the whole UK\". The revaluation of how much firms have to pay is being carried out by independent assessors, funded by local councils. The Scottish Assessors Association has published provisional values, with the finalised figures to be sent out in March before they take effect in the new financial year. The last revaluation in Scotland was carried out in 2010. The Conservatives said they had been \"inundated with letters from businesses across Scotland who are facing huge increases in their rates\", claiming some faced having to pay four times more than they did previously. The Scottish Tourism Alliance has also requested a meeting with Ms Sturgeon to discuss what they called \"crippling\" rates increases, while the Scottish Chambers of Commerce have also raised concerns. Ms Davidson said: \"These shops, hotels and restaurants are vital to our economy, providing much needed jobs in many areas of the country, and we cannot afford to see them simply go out of business. \"That's why I've called on Nicola Sturgeon to listen to the voices of these businesses and the Scottish Tourism Alliance and launch an urgent review into these rate increases. \"The amounts that are being asked for are clearly unsustainable and if immediate action is not taken then we risk seeing a huge amount of damage done to our economy.\" A review group led by former RBS chairman Ken Barclay has been set up to \"enhance and reform\" the business rates system in Scotland, although it will not report back until after the new rates have come into force. Ms Davidson and Ms Sturgeon have clashed over the matter in the Holyrood chamber in recent weeks, with the first minister noting that \"competitive business taxes are important\". She said: \"The final valuations will be issued later this year and all businesses will have the opportunity to appeal if they think that their valuation is wrong. \"We have the most competitive business rates regime in the whole UK, with 100,000 small businesses having been lifted out of business rates altogether. \"We have a tourism sector that, thanks to the good work of those in it, is booming, and the employment level is rising much faster than it is in the rest of the UK.

{"article": "Seamus James Laverty, 58, of Deer Park Road in Toome, pleaded guilty to 16 counts of fraud by false representation at Antrim Crown Court. Laverty sold ordinary glass as fire safety glass between 2010 and 2013 when he worked on the factory floor of Glassworks Ireland. The fraud totalled \u00a3145,000. The glass was sold to the construction industry and later used in buildings across Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and England.

A whistleblower, who was a competitor of Laverty, became suspicious of his company's cheap tenders and acquired a sample of fire safety glass from Glassworks Ireland. He discovered it was, in fact, ordinary laminate glass which had been stamped as fire resistant. The whistleblower alerted police and an investigation began. The court heard that Laverty had his own glass business but had gone bankrupt, so the company was taken over by his son under a new name. He was an employee of his son's business when the fraud occurred. A judge described the case as \"chilling\". Referring to potential harm to members of the public in a fire, he said: \"By the grace of God it was avoided but that's no thanks to you.\" The judge added that because of the extreme financial pressures Laverty had been under and mental difficulties he had experienced because of those, he was prepared to \"temper justice with mercy\".

{"article": "The idea was discussed at a meeting between Justice Minister Caroline Dineage and parents who failed to receive the ashes of their dead babies. It followed an inquiry into failings at Shrewsbury crematorium. Glen Perkins, who formed the Action for Ashes campaign group, said Mrs Dineage had proposed a national consultation. It is expected to include affected families throughout England and Wales as well as industry experts. Mr Perkins - whose daughter Olivia died from sudden infant death syndrome in 2007 - described the meeting as \"very positive\" and said there was a willingness by the government to resolve the matter \"sooner rather than later\". He was joined in Westminster by parents from Leicester, Hull, Banbury and Stoke-on-Trent. They handed in a 61,000-signature petition calling for the return of ashes to be a legal requirement. Families were accompanied by Daniel Kawczynski, MP for Shrewsbury, who has secured a parliamentary debate on the issue on Wednesday. In a statement, Mrs Dineage said: \"Having heard the experiences of some of the families affected, it is clear we must do all we can to make sure this never happens again. \"No parent should have their grief compounded by a system that is supposed to help. The Emstrey report had a number of recommendations and it is imperative that we consider each one carefully.\" Last month, David Jenkins, who led the independent inquiry into failings in Shrewsbury, said he had been \"struck by the absence of authoritative national guidance\". He proposed the creation of a national inspector of crematoriums. About 60 families are believed to have been affected by failures at Shrewsbury's Emstrey crematorium between 1996 and 2012. Speaking at the time, Mr Jenkins said there was clearly \"no more painful experience\" than losing a child and that the issue of infant cremation should be treated as of \"the utmost importance\". A Freedom of Information inquiry by the BBC last year found the ashes of more than 1,000 babies were not handed to their parents between 2008 and 2013. In March, former Justice Minister Simon Hughes had suggested new national guidelines could be brought in by the end of the year. There was a real sense of positivity from the families that made the trip to London - a feeling they had done all they could to raise this issue. Now they are keeping a close eye on what happens next. I understand a consultation could start very soon and families are already being asked to register their details with the Ministry of Justice. Emotions were high when the campaigners handed in their petition. Five families carried boxes full to the brim with signatures. Glen Perkins, whose daughter Olivia died in 2007, was in tears on the steps of Number 10 Downing Street and that sums up the journey he and other families have been on. Other families put their arms around him as they posed for photos and then knocked on the door to hand in their petition.

{"article": "At least 19 people are known to taken their lives in 2008 and 2009 as the company cut thousands of jobs. Judicial sources say the company and ex-boss Didier Lombard are suspected of using a policy of unsettling staff to speed up job losses. France Telecom became Orange in 2013. It will now be up to an examining judge to decide whether or not to order a trial. But if it goes ahead it would be the first trial in France for bullying (moral harassment) of such a large company. As well as the former CEO, other figures could also face trial including his right-hand man Louis-Pierre Wenes, human resources head Olivier Barberot and four other directors. In 2006, Mr Lombard announced plans to cut 22,000 jobs and move another 14,000 workers, as France Telecom pushed for greater efficiency in the wake of privatisation two years earlier. According to an internal document cited by French media, he told a high-level meeting that he would \"do it one way or another, through the window or through the door\". In submissions made late last month, the Paris prosecutor accuses France Telecom of enacting a policy in 2007 that resulted in unsettling workers and creating a \"professional climate that provoked anxiety\" at the time of a \"delicate restructuring\" of the company, a judicial source told AFP news agency. The true number of suicides involving staff is unclear, but 60 people are thought to have taken their lives over a three-year period, and unions say as many as 35 died in 2008 and 2009. Officials speak of 19 deaths during the two years, 12 attempted suicides and eight other cases involving depression or related illnesses. Although the suicide rate at France Telecom was similar to the national average, many of those who died left notes blaming pressure from management. Mr Lombard accepted the restructuring upset employees but he has rejected the idea that it led to people taking their own lives.

{"article": "Reports say supporters of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have booed Congress party chief ministers at three different official functions in the last few days. Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda's speech was repeatedly disturbed on Tuesday during an event in Mr Modi's presence. Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren, an ally of the Congress party, and Maharashtra's Prithviraj Chavan were also \"heckled by BJP supporters\" at different functions. Newspapers and websites feel such incidents are dangerous for India's federal structure. Such behaviour \"is hardly reassuring for any leader who plans to share the stage with his PM\", says an article on the First Post website. The article says that \"at first blush, this may seem like a minor spat driven by political ego\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but it underlines a certain Jekyll and Hyde quality that Mr Modi's leadership has acquired...\" \"It's just bad precedent that will, in the end, undermine Mr Modi's own credibility when he talks of working with the opposition - or when he visits an opposition-ruled state and can't find a single chief minister who will share a stage with him,\" it adds. Following the incidents, several Congress leaders have declared that they will no longer share stage with Mr Modi. The Tribune says such anger is \"manufactured\" and is \"directed only at the rival party's chief ministers\". \"The BJP is well aware that any protest in the presence of the PM would get wide publicity and thus serve the party's political strategy of creating an anti-Congress wave [in the upcoming state elections],\" it says. However, the Congress party's decision to not attend any official events with Mr Modi has also attracted criticism in the media. \"The Congress really appears to be losing the plot. This is evident from the childish reaction of some of its chief ministers who have refused to share the dais with Mr Modi,\" says the Hindustan Times. Meanwhile, the federal government has set a target of three years to clean the heavily-polluted Ganges river, reports say. Mr Modi had promised to clean up the river during his poll campaign speeches earlier in the year. The Ganges, India's longest river, is revered by Hindus and supports a third of the country's 1.2 billion people living on its floodplains.

{"article": "The big difference is that the numbers from which you make your six selections will go up in October from one to 49 to one to 59. While this doesn't sound like it will make a huge difference, it actually takes your odds of winning the jackpot from one in 14 million to one in 45 million. Camelot, which runs the lottery, says that the new system will create bigger, rolling jackpots, which is true. Because it is so much less likely that anybody will win the top prize, there will be many more rollovers. It also says that the chances of winning a prize have increased, which is true, because people who match two numbers will get a free go on the game the following week. The chances of winning a cash prize, however, have fallen considerably. There will also be a raffle that will give prizes of \u00a31m and \u00a320,000, for which the odds of winning depend on the number of entries, but the organisers estimate that you have a one in 10 million chance of winning either \u00a31m on the raffle or the jackpot. This change comes only two years after the last set of changes, which doubled the price of a ticket to \u00a32 but introduced the raffle with \u00a320,000 prizes. At the time, the prize for matching three balls increased from \u00a310 to \u00a325. The odds of matching three balls were unchanged, but of course the cost of entry had doubled, which effectively doubled the odds (because \u00a32 would previously have bought two tickets). The estimated prize for matching five balls plus the bonus ball fell from \u00a3100,000 to \u00a350,000 while the prize for matching five balls went from \u00a31,500 to \u00a31,000. It appears that the Lotto organisers have discovered that what persuades people to buy lottery tickets is rollovers to create enormous prizes. Camelot's commentary in its financial reporting about the effect that Euromillions rollovers (or the lack of them) have on ticket sales is very clear about that. The company is clearly counting on the lengthening odds of winning both vast amounts of money and small and middling sums having less effect. Because honestly, who can cope in their head with the difference between odds of 14 million to one and odds of 45 million to one? It's like comparing the odds of flipping a coin and getting 22 consecutive heads with the odds of getting 24.

Five other convicts from Indonesia, Malawi, Nigeria, Vietnam and the Netherlands, were executed on Sunday. Convicted of drugs charges, they faced a firing squad in Central Java province shortly after midnight local time. Five were executed on the island of Nusa Kambangan and the other one, a Vietnamese woman, was executed in the small central Javanese town of Boyolali. Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff said in a statement that she was \"outraged and dismayed\". \"Relations between the two countries have been affected,\" said Ms Rousseff. \"The Brazilian ambassador to Jakarta has been recalled for consultations,\" she added. The Netherlands has also recalled its ambassador, after Foreign Minister Bert Koenders called the execution of Dutch citizen Ang Kiem Soe, 52, \"an unacceptable denial of human dignity and integrity\". Indonesia has some of the world's toughest drug laws. The country resumed executions in 2013 after an unofficial four-year moratorium. The country's Attorney General Muhammad Prasetyo said \"hopefully, this will have a deterrent effect\". President Joko Widodo has said that he will show no mercy towards drug criminals because they have ruined the lives of so many. Ms Rousseff had made a plea for clemency on Friday, but it was rejected by Mr Widodo. She told her Indonesian counterpart that she respected the sovereignty and judicial system of his country but as a mother and head of state she was making the appeal for humanitarian reasons. Brazil says Mr Widodo said he understood the Brazilian president's concern but said he could not commute the sentence as the full legal process had been followed.

{"article": "For the past decade or so, I have been writing stories about the return of trains to the Borders but, of course, the struggle started long before that. Indeed, you could argue that the battle really began back in 1969 - or even earlier - when the Waverley line through the region was closed. On the night when the final train set off from Edinburgh there was a demonstration in Galashiels station. There were also protests at Melrose and Hawick. Despite the opposition, the sound of a train pulling up at a station would be absent from the Scottish Borders for the next four decades and more. There were regular rumbles of discontent in between times and they started to take more solid form at the end of the 20th century. In 1999, the Campaign for Borders Rail was formally launched at a Burns Supper in Melrose Station. It subsequently gathered thousands of signatures on a petition pressing for a route to the region to be reopened. And, in 2000, an independent study concluded that the reopening of the Borders rail link could be financially viable. The gears of progress were slowly clicking into motion and, five years later, a Holyrood committee supported the case for reopening the line. Then, in 2006, the bill was approved which would pave the way for work to finally begin. At that time a \u00c2\u00a3155m price tag was attached to the project with a forecast opening in 2011. However, there were soon problems in meeting both that deadline and budget and it emerged that both would be missed. By 2008, the estimated costs had risen to between \u00c2\u00a3235m and \u00c2\u00a3295m and the opening date was pushed back two years. Work officially started in 2010 but there were still a few twists and turns in store. Three groups were selected to submit tenders for the work but as companies dropped out of the process that plan had to be scrapped. Instead, the Scottish government decided that Network Rail could take the project forward. Despite these apparent setbacks, the major clearance and constructions works continued along the length of the line from Tweedbank to Edinburgh. All along the route, there were now clear indications that transport between the capital and the Borders was being transformed as stations, bridges and new road layouts slotted into place. And, although the completion deadline was once again put back to 2015, the reality of the scale of the scheme was really starting to sink in. Then, last year, a symbolic moment was reached as the track laying began. As machines slowly rolled along the route, it became clear that the decision which had so incensed many people nearly half a century ago would finally be reversed. Some have said it does not go far enough and would like to see the line extended back to Carlisle where it used to reach. Others have concerns about turning south east Scotland into a commuter belt for Edinburgh or question how much effect it will have in more remote parts of the Borders. But what cannot be doubted is what a historic moment it is for this part of the country. A region which has gone without railway stations for so long will now have no fewer than three.

Separately, police have killed three suspected Islamists in a crackdown on extremists blamed for the murders. Critics say the government is in denial about the killings, most of which have been blamed on or claimed by Islamists. Two alleged members of the banned Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) were shot dead in Dhaka when police raided a home in the city - police said unidentified gunmen opened fire on them. A third - said to have been linked to a recent bombing of an Ahmadiya mosque - was killed in western Rashahi district. Who is behind the Bangladesh killings? Is extremism on the rise in Bangladesh? Lurching from secularism to sectarian terror? Ananda Gopal Ganguly is the third person to be killed in such an attack in the past two days. \"He left home this morning saying that he was going to a Hindu house to offer prayers,\" deputy police chief Gopinath Kanjilal told AFP news agency. \"Later, farmers found his near-decapitated body in a rice field.\" The Middle East-based Islamic State militant group says it carried out the killing, but a government spokesman told the BBC that all the recent attacks were the work of domestic extremists. On Sunday the wife of a senior police officer investigating the attacks and a Christian businessman were killed. Police say more than 40 people have been killed since January last year in the wave of attacks on those seen by extremists as offensive to Islam. The government insists that Islamic State does not have a presence in Bangladesh and has tended to blame the opposition and local militant groups. Critics have accused the government of failing to properly address the violence in Bangladesh. The grim list of those who have fallen victim to attacks by Islamist militants in Bangladesh is growing ever more diverse. Secular bloggers, academics, gay rights activists, and members of religious minorities including Shia, Sufi and Ahmadi Muslims, Christians and Hindus have all been killed, many of them hacked to death. A university professor whose family said he was not an atheist was murdered in April, suggesting the list of those at risk had widened further. Who exactly is behind the attacks remains murky. Bangladesh has myriad extremist groups and there have been few convictions over the attacks.

But Nato's spokeswoman said the campaign was conducted \"with unprecedented care and precision\".

She added that the alliance \"looked into each credible allegation\" of harm to civilians and \"confirmed that the specific targets struck by Nato were legitimate military targets\". Aircraft from the US, the UK and France conducted most of the 9,658 strike sorties last year, targeting forces loyal to Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi. The point of the Nato air campaign in Libya last year was to protect civilians, so how many innocent people died is still a sensitive issue, BBC diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall reports. In its report published on Monday . , the US-based HRW said it had examined in detail evidence of claims of civilian deaths from eight separate Nato strikes. In one instance, it said a first bomb killed 14 people and a second, moments later, killed 18 more who had rushed to help victims. \"We're calling for prompt, credible and thorough investigations,\" HRW's Fred Abrahams, the main author of the report, told BBC News. Mr Abrahams says Nato refuses to acknowledge the deaths and has offered no compensation to families. \"Until now, Nato has taken a position of denial,\" he said. \"I think it will lead to unnecessary civilian deaths in the future if Nato refuses to look at what went wrong and make corrections.\" In March, another human rights organisation, . Amnesty International, said it had documented 55 cases . of named civilians, including 16 children and 14 women, killed in air strikes. It said Nato had failed to investigate these cases thoroughly. Source: Nato . Adel Ebsat, a relative of three victims who died from an air strike near the eastern town of Zlitan, told the BBC he had repeatedly asked the Libyan government to launch a case against Nato and for an investigation to be carried out.

Most Libyans feel that the alliance helped the country succeed in its uprising against Col Gaddafi, which toppled and killed him last year, our correspondent says. The overwhelming belief, she adds, is that countless deaths were avoided because of the West's intervention.

{"article": "The so-called Valley fire is thought to be one of the worst in the state's history, and is still only 30% contained, spanning three counties. One disabled woman has died and four firefighters have been injured, while 23,000 people have been forced to flee their homes. Two dozen fires are raging in Oregon, California and Washington state. But the most destruction is in California, where mandatory evacuation orders have been lifted in some areas so residents can return to survey the devastation. Firefighters are scrambling to protect not only homes but the state's famed giant Sequoia trees, as the largest of a dozen fires edges ever closer to one of the national parks in which they grow. While the Valley fire has been the most destructive, covering an area twice the size of San Francisco, a second known as the Butte fire, outside Sacramento, has claimed 166 homes. Firefighters say it is covering 71,780 acres (29,048 hectares) and is now 40% contained. Officials say fire teams have been helped by cooler weather and higher humidity, although the forecast is for higher temperatures to return at the weekend . In California, the sound of summer is the crackle of flames. No one here in Lake County can remember anything like the Valley Fire. Firefighters say it has already consumed an area twice the size of San Francisco. And still it burns, leaving behind a landscape drained of colour, silent and lifeless. Ranches which stood here for more than a century were wiped out in seconds. And in the little communities of Cobb, Middletown and Hidden Valley, entire streets have been destroyed. For mile after mile the ashes are still smouldering. Most people have not yet been allowed to return to inspect the damage but when they do many will find that there is nothing to salvage. Cooler weather with some moisture in the air is helping but it will take more than that to stop the blaze. The fires burns and burns and California is counting the cost. In northern California, people who have been evacuated from their homes or lost their homes completely are gathered at emergency centres and high schools. Andy Elliott, a British firefighter working to battle the Valley fire, said it is one of the most extreme in California for a long time. Firefighters are calling it a \"career fire\", such is its speed and force, he said. \"The fire behaviour is unprecedented.\" Mr Elliot said he knew the four injured firefighters and had breakfast with them just before they were hurt. \"It's a very extreme incident... very sad.\" California is used to battling raging wildfires. But after a four-year drought, the state is suffering more than usual - 5,255 fires have scorched 217,827 acres of land so far this year, compared with 3,638 fires burning 90,894 acres during the same period last year. Northern California is currently bearing the brunt of the blazes, with 13,000 firefighters working 24-hour shifts to try to contain more than a dozen fires sweeping across parched hillsides in Butte, Lake, Napa and Sonoma counties. But Calfire's Lynnette Round says more wildfires could start anywhere in the state at any given moment. \"The terrain is so dried up that even if it rains a little, trees and brush are so dry, they could ignite at any time,\" she says. Southern California typically experiences its worst wildfires in October and November, when ferocious Santa Ana winds - which blow from the desert to the coast - can reach up to 80mph and whip blazes across swathes of arid land. The state's largest wildfire in recent years was in San Diego county in 2003. That burned 273,246 acres, 2,820 buildings and led to 15 deaths. California's deadliest wildfire on record was also in southern California, according to Calfire. Twenty-nine people died in Los Angeles county in 1933.

{"article": "Eleven million documents held by the Panama-based company Mossack Fonseca were leaked to German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung, then shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). In Russia, the three main pro-Kremlin TV channels have not reported the story so far. This is quite typical behaviour for Russia's mainstream broadcasters, which often steer clear of controversial topics involving Russian leaders. The leak reveals a suspected money-laundering ring run by a Russian bank and involving close associates of President Vladimir Putin. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected the allegations: \"Even though Vladimir Putin is not explicitly mentioned anywhere, it is obvious for us that our president has been and will be the main target.\" The story is covered by privately owned business channel RBK and independent digital news channel Dozhd TV - sources that seldom shy away from major international stories that cast Russia in an unfavourable light. The ICIJ report was released late on Sunday night in Moscow, missing print deadlines for newspapers. But the ICIJ's Russian partner, the opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta, featured a seven-page hard copy report and a large online version on its website. Since then, most of the popular online news sources have included reports on the story. There has been plenty of chatter on social media. The hashtag #panamapapers has been in and out of the Top 10 Twitter trends for Russia since Sunday evening. It seems the story has underwhelmed many Russian bloggers, who were not surprised to learn about potential large-scale corruption. There have been plenty of sarcastic jokes about the alleged sums involved. In Germany, Munich's Sueddeutsche Zeitung - which originally received the documents - has the online headline \"Putin's rich friends - the trail of the secret money\". The heavyweight Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung says \"Panama's state prosecutors investigate offshore firms\", while Berlin's Die Welt reports on \"The billion-dollar trails of a global affair\". The tabloid Bild says \"Data leak reveals shady transactions worth billions\". China's press is quiet on allegations that the Panama Papers involve Chinese nationals, partly because it is a national holiday, the Qingming Festival. News outlets have reported the story, omitting any mention of China being involved. However, it appears that dialogue on the papers is now being censored, as features on the Sina and NetEase web portals have been removed. There are indications that Weibo social media users want to talk about it, with thousands of posters attempting to discuss the story using the hashtag #PanamaPapers. Weibo shows that more than 2,000 users have used this hashtag, but posts using it appear currently unavailable to view. A search of \"Panama\" on verified media accounts brings up no results, suggesting that the microblog's moderators wish to limit people from searching for this term. Independent Hong Kong papers, meanwhile, highlight the involvement of the families of a senior Chinese official and a prominent figure. Arabic news websites and online version of dailies have picked up the story, although regional TV channels have yet to report on it. Egyptian dailies are leading with revelations about the family of former President Hosni Mubarak. On Twitter, the hashtags #PanamaDocuments in Arabic and #PanamaLeaks in English have been used in tens of thousands of tweets, trending in Egypt within 12 hours.

{"article": "The aim is to help people save money by encouraging them to change their banks, especially if they are likely to go overdrawn. The plans come from the Competition and Markets Authority, which has the power to enforce its proposals. They are the result of its two-year investigation. The big idea is that something must be done to break the inertia of the UK banking public. Just 3% of individuals and 4% of businesses switch their banks in any one year. The CMA has already come to the conclusion that there is not enough competition to pressurise the banks into offering significantly better or cheaper services than their rivals. In effect the big five banks - RBS, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and Santander - plus the Nationwide building society have their own huge, but largely captive, markets. So the aim is to make it easier for people to switch banks and accounts, and to encourage them to save money by finding a better deal. \"The older and larger banks, which still account for the large majority of the retail banking market, do not have to work hard enough to win and retain customers and it is difficult for new and smaller providers to attract customers,\" the CMA says. The other big issue is one that has dogged the industry and its customers for many years - the ability of banks to charge more or less what they like if you go overdrawn without permission. In 2009, the Office of Fair Trading (now part of the CMA) failed completely in a legal challenge which would have overthrown the right of banks to set their own charges as they saw fit. Now the CMA is ordering the banks to set their own monthly cash limits - a monthly maximum charge - on just how much they can charge if you go into an unauthorised overdraft - going into the red without asking your bank in advance. Of course that doesn't go as far as a regulator being allowed to set a monthly limit on overdraft fees and charges. But the fact there will be some sort of stated cash limit will make things clearer. \"Many personal customers, in particular overdraft users, could make significant savings by switching to a different current account,\" says the CMA. That particular change should happen by September next year. To encourage customers to switch or shop around, the CMA is ordering the banking industry to embrace the idea of Open Banking. That means the financial technology industry is being invited to develop a computer application which will let bank customers run all their bank accounts, including moving money between them, even if they have several accounts spread around different banks. At the moment the increasingly popular bank apps, which are issued by banks to their own customers for use on mobile phones, operate that bank's accounts only. This new, all-purpose, banking app should be able, the CMA says, to let customers upload all their banking details so that \"authorised intermediaries\", such as price comparison services, will be able to tell them where the best accounts and services are to suit the way they typically save and spend. The CMA hopes that this will encourage customers to move money around, either to avoid upcoming overdraft charges, or to gain higher interest on more generous accounts. There are quite a few other proposals, for instance: . The CMA has spent the past two years investigating the banking industry. Its final report, published today, is just the latest in a very long line of official inquiries into the banking industry that have been held over the past 20 years or so. But now the CMA's plans have been finalised and published, they have various implementation dates ranging from the beginning of 2017 to the autumn of 2018.", "abstract": "Some very big changes are now in the pipeline for the way people use their bank accounts and the way banks charge their customers.", "candidate": "The UK's big five banks are being ordered by the competition regulator to do two things.", "doc_id": 1538, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "To encourage customers to switch or shop around, the CMA is ordering the banking industry to embrace the idea of Open Banking.", "explanation": "the summary say banks have been told to do two things and the source text supports this.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

{"article": "David Greenwood said fewer than 100 of the estimated 1,400 victims identified in the Jay Report have taken part in a raft of new enquiries. He believes \"radical change\" is needed for more victims to come forward. It is nearly a year since the report into the shocking scale of abuse in the South Yorkshire town was published. Mr Greenwood, who works for 58 of the girls subjected to sexual abuse by gangs of men in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013, concedes that improvements have been made locally in the past 12 months. Two of the agencies that bore the brunt of criticism in the aftermath of the publication, South Yorkshire Police and Rotherham Council, have made progress but a truly independent organisation is needed to gain the trust of some survivors, he said. \"Both agencies have improved in Rotherham in the last 12 months but survivors of exploitation will be unwilling to come forward to them unless radical changes are made. \"An agency independent from South Yorkshire Police and RMBC [Rotherham Council] is essential for the 1,400 young women who need help. \"I am aware of only around 50 to 60 girls having come forward. This means there are around 1,350 whose lives could be improved with specialist help,\" he added. The report by Prof Alexis Jay, published on 26 August 2014, detailed how children as young as 11 were raped by multiple perpetrators, abducted, trafficked to other cities in England, beaten and intimidated. It revealed \"blatant\" collective failures by the council's leadership, senior managers had \"underplayed\" the scale of the problem and South Yorkshire Police had failed to prioritise the issue. Its findings provoked outrage and a wave of resignations followed in its wake, the most high profile of which was South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner, Shaun Wright, who had been in charge of children's services in the town during the period some of the abuse happened. The council was later deemed \"not fit for purpose\" by government inspectors and its powers were handed over to government-appointed commissioners. The police now have a dedicated team of more than 60 working on child sexual exploitation (CSE) and its joint operation with the council and the Crown Prosecution Service, Operation Clover, has brought some suspected perpetrators before the courts. The police insist they are working hard to restore trust with those affected by CSE. Rotherham's police commander, Ch Supt Jason Harwin, said: \"Over the last 12 months, if nothing else, restoring confidence has been really, really important and we've still got a journey to go on. \"The key focus has been around the victims and survivors. We need to understand better what the issues are for them and we could have done better and what we need to do for the future.\" Mr Harwin said he understands the public want to see perpetrators jailed and that his force has arrested 460 people for child abuse offences in the last 12 months - with 76 of these suspected of involvement in \"grooming and facilitation\". And he said 22 people have been charged with CSE-related offences in Rotherham, and there are currently 46 live CSE investigations in the town. But Mr Greenwood believes despite South Yorkshire Police's best efforts a new approach is needed to convince more victims to speak up. \"Only when large numbers of girls affected feel able to speak to the police and with confidence that they will be believed, protected and supported will we know more,\" he said. \"I have spoken with many girls who simply want nothing to do with the police at present and until the police put in place really good tailor-made support from specialist and dedicated officers they will not engage.\" \"I would like to see a truly independent agency offering survivors good quality support, protection, talking therapies, help with housing, childcare and education. \"We still have a long way to go.\"", "abstract": "A fraction of the hundreds of victims of child sexual exploitation in Rotherham have sought help, according to a lawyer for some of the survivors.", "candidate": "Fewer than 60 of the girls identified in the Rotherham abuse report have come forward a year on, according to the man who led the inquiry.", "doc_id": 3262, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "Fewer than 60 of the girls identified in the Rotherham abuse report have come forward a year on, according to the man who led the inquiry.", "evidence": "\"I am aware of only around 50 to 60 girls having come forward.", "explanation": "The summary is supported by the source information that according to someone who is working for the girls or \"the man who led the inquiry\" has stated he is onlhy aware of less than 60 girls having come forward in the Rotherham abuse reports since he began a year ago.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

Prof Barde received international acclaim in 1989 with the discovery of a gene which creates a protein - brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) - which is involved in number of brain processes including memory. He has explored the the role of BDNF plays in healthy brain function along with dysfunction. Recently his team at the University of Basel focused on how some drugs can increase BDNF levels in specific areas of the brain. The research helped in the development of new drugs, including the first oral treatment of multiple sclerosis. Prof Barde says he hopes to develop his current research interests of using stem cells to understand how the brain works and also to explore mental health illnesses such as depression. He said: \"Some of the work I'll be undertaking in Cardiff will be about understanding the meaning of the link between the nervous system and neurological diseases which currently remains pretty mysterious, particularly in the case of depression. \"But alongside several outstanding research groups at Cardiff University, I will also aim to advance research using embryonic stem cells and reprogrammed somatic cells to advance understanding of neuronal dysfunction. \"This is a really exciting time for me, and for advances in neurobiology and for science in Wales.\" Cardiff University is already widely recognised for research into stem cells. The university's chancellor and Nobel Prize winner, Sir Martin Evans, was the first scientist to identify embryonic stem cells. These are cells which are taken from an embryo and which can develop into many other types of cells that can then be adapted for a wide variety of medical purposes. There is some opposition to this research on moral or ethical grounds although the research has proved to be highly valuable in understanding many diseases. Cardiff University vice-chancellor Prof Colin Riordan believes the appointment will build on the university's strengths. \"It is a testament to the university's existing strengths in neuroscience and stem cell research that we are able to attract a scientist of Prof Barde's calibre. \"By working with others in his field, Prof Barde will be able to help Cardiff University tackle some of the biggest health challenges of our time.\" Prof Ole Petersen, director of the university's school of biosciences, told BBC Wales: \"I'm delighted about this great prospect of fostering world-beating research. \"Science is an international business. We see throughout Europe that countries with the most internationalised science do the best science. \"And we're importing one of the most important stars.\" Economy and Science Minister Edwina Hart said: \"A strong science research capability is vital to improving our economic well-being and securing a prosperous, healthy and sustainable future for Wales. \"We already have a lot to be proud of in science and innovation in Wales but the Ser Cymru programme will help us build on that to develop a dynamic and strong base in Wales.\"", "abstract": "A \u00a350m project to attract world-class scientists and their teams to Wales has made its first appointment.", "candidate": "One of the world's leading neuroscientists has been appointed professor of neuroscience at Cardiff University.", "doc_id": 3475, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "One of the world's leading neuroscientists has been appointed at Cardiff University.", "evidence": "Prof Barde, currently at the University of Basel, will take up his post at Cardiff University in September.", "explanation": "The exact position of the appointment is not specified.", "instruction": "Remove the information about professor of neuroscience from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about professor of neuroscience from the summary."]}}
{"article": "But after an amazing Northern Ireland Assembly election result in the constituency in March, Sinn F\u00e9in can see the summit. The party began 155 votes behind the SDLP on the previous assembly poll result of May 2016. They emerged 6,650 votes ahead. That is why many believe Chris Hazzard, one of Sinn F\u00e9in's two candidates in that election, is set to become the party's first MP for South Down. But there is a caveat - or two. Firstly, the SDLP's Margaret Ritchie easily beat Mr Hazzard in the 2015 general election - the margin was 5,891 votes. And, of course, there is the old claim that in Westminster elections many unionists lend their votes to the SDLP to ensure Sinn F\u00e9in is defeated. Right? Well, maybe not this time. According to Paul Smyington, the editor of the Down Recorder newspaper, unionists who were spooked by the surge for Sinn F\u00e9in in March are telling voters on the doorsteps to \"vote for the union\". He claims that could have an \"important impact on this election\". Not that Ms Ritchie appeared bothered about the unionist factor two years ago. In her victory speech, she told her supporters: \"Let us be very clear that the SDLP vote increased and that we have a solid majority now in South Down without any votes being lent to us. \"So, let's lose that myth now.\" That claim is about to be put to the test. Asked about the forthcoming election, the outgoing SDLP MP chose her words carefully. \"I, as an MP who has served for the last seven years, have been an MP for all of the constituents in South Down, representing them on a wide range of issues,\" she said. \"Every vote is valued for me and I look forward to many, many people right across the constituency - irrespective of political affiliations - voting for Margaret Ritchie on 8 June. \"They will get an MP who will represent them both here in the constituency and at Westminster 24-7, 365 days per year.\" Sinn F\u00e9in has been putting a massive effort into the constituency. About 400 people, including the party president Gerry Adams, attended Mr Hazzard's campaign launch in Newcastle. \"When the results were coming in in March more people joined Sinn F\u00e9in in the six hours during the count than had previously joined in the previous six months in South Down,\" said Mr Hazzard. \"There's an appetite now for Sinn F\u00e9in that is growing year-on-year. \"We have canvas teams out in nearly every village and town every night and certainly the message coming back is positive. \"People see the work that we are doing, the leadership that we are giving and they're coming on board.\" The largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party, is not represented this time by the well-known Jim Wells but by a first-timer, 32-year-old accountant Diane Forsythe. She said the election in March was a wake-up call for unionists. \"There's definitely that strong feeling that I'm getting on the doors that people are wanting to come out and put their pro-union support on the ticket,\" she said. \"I would ask them to do that because ultimately lending their vote to any nationalist party is a vote against the union.\" Ulster Unionist Harold McKee, who lost his assembly seat in March, said the unionist mindset this time is difficult to read. \"I'm hearing mixed views on it,\" he said. \"I am a unionist and if I stand as a unionist I'll not be asking someone else to vote for another party - I expect them to vote for me.\" The Alliance Party shocked many by out-polling the Ulster Unionists in March. It is represented this time by councillor Andrew McMurray, who said the party has a \"solid base\". \"I think the positive, progressive and pro-European messages that we're putting out will hopefully resonate with the voters and they will show that South Down wants that Alliance voice.\" Sinn F\u00e9in knows that Ms Ritchie cannot be written off.

He saw a jar on the floor of the hallway and splash marks on a dado rail and wall mirror. William Burns, 56, and Alexander Porter, 48, deny throwing acid in the face of Mr Findlay on 23 December 2015. They also deny a charge of attempted murder in connection with the shooting of a man near an East Dunbartonshire primary school. Det Sgt Warren said he arrived at Mr Findlay's home about an hour after the alleged attack. One of the accused, William Burns, had already been detained and taken away from the scene. The substance he found in the hallway, he told the court, was found to be sulphuric acid. He also described items he found in the driveway of Mr Findlay's home. They were \"what appeared to be two layers of false teeth, a beanie hat, a snood and a knife\". The knife was found near the threshold of the front door. Mr Warren said that his focus then turned to how Mr Burns might have got to the scene, and how he might have got away. He confirmed to the Advocate Depute Richard Goddard that officers searched CCTV footage from the day of the alleged attack, and also preceding days, to try to establish if the accused had carried out a reconnaissance of the area. Footage from cameras in Crow Rd, and next to Jordanhill school on Chamberlain Rd was shown to the jury. On three separate dates, Mr Warren said a Volvo was seen near Mr Findlay's home - including driving away from the crime scene on the day of the alleged attack, two minutes after Mr Burns had been detained. The detective described it in court as \"yellow or gold\". The jury had already heard that Alexander Porter had a gold-coloured Volvo S40 in 2015. On the 28th January Police Scotland executed a search warrant at the home of Alexander Porter, and detained him. During subsequent questioning, the accused replied \"no comment\" to all questions put to him. Under cross-examination by Susan Duff, defence counsel for Mr Porter, Mr Warren said that 16.5 hours of CCTV footage was examined. But neither the registration number or actual colour of the Volvo was identifiable, nor was the number of occupants in the car. Susan Duff also queried the officer's assertion that he knew the Jordanhill area of the city well, pointing out he had called Woodend Drive \"Woodend Road\".

Seventeen schools built or modernised just over a decade ago under the controversial Public Private Partnership arrangement scheme were shut earlier this month over safety concerns. The council had entered into a deal to build the schools with the specially-formed private company, the Edinburgh Schools Partnership, and construction work was carried out by Miller Construction. Under the deal, the profit-making company built the schools, runs the buildings and maintains them. The council is, in effect, a tenant. Children at all 17 schools are now back in classrooms but finding alternative accommodation has been a major logistical operation and some youngsters face lengthy journeys to temporary sites. Some form of investigation or inquiry into the debacle is expected to be launched after the Scottish election. 17 . Schools closed over safety fears . 7,600 Primary and secondary pupils affected by the closures . 61 Alternative schools are being used . 655 Teachers relocated . 70 Bus services laid on to transport pupils .

{"article": "Maughold Lighthouse, the closest point on the island to England, is situated about 31 miles (50km) from Cumbria. It was designed and built by David A Stevenson, of the Stevenson engineers, at an estimated cost of \u00a311,000. The ceremony will be held on Sunday and attended by the island's Lieutenant Governor, Adam Wood. A Northern Lighthouse Board (NLB) spokesman said: \"On 15 April, Maughold lighthouse will have provided a guiding beam of light to the mariner for 100 years. \"Battling against the odds, the Stevenson family constructed wonders of engineering that have withstood the test of time - an amazing historical achievement.\" David Stevenson was a Scottish lighthouse designer who designed over 30 lighthouses in Scotland. The Stevensons also included the writer Robert Louis Stevenson, who was said to have gained inspiration for his books Kidnapped and Treasure Island from family visits to remote lighthouses in the British Isles. The Northern Lighthouse Board was established in 1786 and is responsible for about 200 lighthouses. In 1854 the organisation took responsibility for six Isle of Man lighthouses - Point of Ayre, Maughold Head, Douglas Head, Langness, Calf of Man and Chicken Rock. Maughold was the last lighthouse to have been built on the island. Work began in 1911 and finished in April 1914. It consists of a 23m (77ft) tower, which is situated on a slope of headland at Maughold Head. \"The building of the light at Maughold Head was not an easy task,\" said Lorna Hunter from the NLB. \"The tower is positioned half way down a cliff and can only be reached by a flight of 128 steps.\" The keeper's houses, now privately owned, are situated at the top of the cliff. The coastal residence, which consists of four bedrooms and two bathrooms, was sold in 2012 for about \u00a3600,000. The area between the lighthouse and Port-Vullen is a government-protected breeding ground for more than 35 bird species, including puffins and guillemots. The original Frensel lens at Maughold was named after its French inventor, Augustin Fresnel. It is made from a series of perfectly polished crystal glass lenses set into a brass structure. The automated light, now monitored around the clock from a remote centre, is visited and maintained locally on a regular basis.

{"article": "One victim, from Londonderry, told the BBC that blackmailers had demanded \u00c2\u00a310,000 not to reveal an intimate video on Facebook. He described two months of \"hell\" after being tricked into making the recording by a woman he met online. Det Ch Insp James Mullan praised the man for coming forward to warn others. \"We get about two or three reports a week across Northern Ireland of predominantly male people within the community who become victims of this type of incident,\" he said. \"I want to give people the confidence to come forward to the police and report it,\" he said. \"While we find it very difficult to get the people responsible, it's really important that, not just the police service, but other agencies are there to support these people.\" Most of the scams originate in countries such as Philippines and Morocco, Mr Mullan added. Christopher (not his real name) told the Mark Patterson Show how he received a friend request from a \"very attractive young lady\" on Facebook. \"Over a period of a few days we were chatting. She was a lot younger than I was. I'm in my 40s, she was, maybe, in her 20s. \"I was going through a bitter divorce at the time and you know... I was enjoying the attention, looking for a new relationship,\" he said. \"Over a period of time, it progressed to another level where she asked me did I want a video chat and the conversation became quite sexual. \"She got me on my phone through messenger and asked: 'Do you want to see me naked?' \"I put on video call, and all of a sudden I see a bedroom, and a girl naked, touching herself, caressing herself - she asked me to do the same thing. \"Then all of a sudden she left the camera and came back and she seemed to push some sort of a button, and all of a sudden it was a video of me doing what I shouldn't. \"She says: 'You've just broken the law, if you don't send \u00c2\u00a310,000 it (the video) will be posted to various friends.'\" One of the names that appeared on Christopher's device was the name of his daughter. \"I went into total panic, total panic and talk about cold sweats,\" he said. The blackmailer managed to post the video onto Christopher's Facebook timeline, but he was able to swiftly remove it. Christopher was given 24 hours to send his blackmailer the money. During this time, he described how feelings of shame, disgust and most of all fear, nearly drove him over the edge. In the end, Christopher reported the person to Facebook, and said the company was very supportive. He also spoke to the Samaritans before confiding in two close friends, who accompanied him to the local police station. \"That constable was absolutely brilliant, she saw the stress I was under, she said 'you've broken no law',\" he said. He explained that the police wanted to trace the IP address of the computer being used by the blackmailer. \"The case is now closed, they never found out, but I went through hell for two months,\" he said. Although still living under the threat of his video being released, Christopher said he felt good. \"If I could just use my pain and anxiety to help just one person, then to be honest, I feel quite proud that I've done something.

The annual week-long event in June attracts about 300,000 visitors each year.

However, the Labour MP has not ruled out some kind of deal with the SNP. Mr Murphy told BBC political editor Brian Taylor that it was \"disrespectful\" to discuss political deals before the general election. On the suggestion of his party entering into a Conservative arrangement in the event of a hung parliament, Mr Murphy was very clear. He said: \"We don't need lessons from Tory dinosaurs about how to run Scotland, what a ludicrous idea.\" Mr Murphy added that the differences between the Labour Party and the Conservative Party were bigger than \"I have seen for a number of years\". Writing in The Independent, Lord Baker of Dorking said a Labour minority government reliant on the SNP would be a \"nightmare\" situation at Westminster. He added that such an arrangement could \"stretch the constitution of our country to breaking point\". However, the SNP said it was trusted more than Labour to keep the Tories out. Asked if a deal with the nationalists was possible, Mr Murphy said he did not want to get into a \"post-match analysis on an event that has not yet taken place\".

The debate over coalition deals has arisen because polling suggests neither Labour nor the Conservatives would gain an overall majority in this year's election. If that is the case a coalition deal with smaller parties could be possible or a so-called \"confidence and supply\" arrangement could be agreed whereby the smaller party supports the larger party in key votes.

France strongly condemned the officers' action which \"does not conform to the normal work practices agreed between France and Belgium\".

But when the officers spotted them walking on foot towards the border, they offered them a lift and accidentally strayed into France near Nieppe.

{"article": "The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators, says the 16 million fares currently on offer are \"baffling\" for passengers. It wants to ensure passengers are offered the cheapest possible fares. The trial, starting from May, will initially benefit people travelling between Scotland and south-west England. A traveller buying an off-peak return from Wick, in northern Scotland, to Par, in Cornwall, can currently pay up to \u00a3342.50, although in practice few people pay that amount. However, by buying six separate fares for each leg of the journey, passengers can pay as little as \u00a380 for the same trip. That would involve buying tickets from Wick to Inverness, Inverness to Edinburgh and Edinburgh to Par. The RDG says the potential saving of \u00a3262 will soon be offered to customers automatically. CrossCountry Trains, the main operator taking part in the trials, may eventually offer savings on other routes as well. Passengers travelling between London and Glasgow, or London and Edinburgh on Virgin Trains, will also benefit from clearer pricing. Operators currently have to offer a return fare between these cities, which is regulated by the government. But the RDG says it would be more transparent - and possibly cheaper - for commuters if single fares were regulated instead. It wants more booking of single fares - at ticket offices and ticket machines, as well as on the internet. Ticket machines on stations will also be updated, to make sure they show the cheapest fares available. \"We're determined to overhaul the system to cut out red-tape, jargon and complication to make it easier for customers to buy fares they can trust, including from ticket machines,\" said Jacqueline Starr, RDG director of customer experience. The trial will also see the removal of some historic fares which do not make sense. Ben Morris, business reporter . In the British Rail era, rail fares were a relatively simple affair, with ticket prices worked out on a cost-per mile basis. But in the 1990s, in an effort to make the network more efficient, the operation of rail services was handed to private train operating companies (Tocs). The Tocs were given some freedom to set ticket prices, with advanced ticket bookings particularly important to them, as it helps them to keep their trains full. To protect passengers, other fares were regulated, including season tickets and off-peak fares. The result is a patchwork of fares, that becomes even more complicated when a passenger wants to cross several train regions. Savvy travellers have been taking advantage of this by splitting their journey into several tickets, rather than one through-ticket. Today's scheme aims to make those savings available to everyone. At the moment passengers travelling between London St Pancras and Sheffield pay extra to travel via Grantham, for example, even though it takes longer. Such fares date back to the pre-privatisation era of British Rail. News of the trial was welcomed by passenger groups. \"What's clear from our research is that passengers find the ticketing system far too complex,\" said Anthony Smith, chief executive of Transport Focus. \"The presence of cheaper fares that are 'hidden' in the system really damages trust between passengers and train companies.\" However Martin Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert, said more needed to be done. \"It's quite simple. When you book a rail ticket, whether it's in a station or online, people should be given the cheapest price available at that time for their chosen journey. \"These changes will not make that happen. While it is certainly a move in the right direction, people cannot have the confidence that if they book a ticket, they will be paying the best price,\" he said. The price of average train fares - including regulated and unregulated tickets - went up by 2.3% in January, even though consumer prices rose by just 1.6% last year. The rise led to protests by passengers and rail unions.", "abstract": "Passengers using cross-country train routes could save up to \u00a3260 a journey, under a trial scheme to simplify fares.", "candidate": "Single rail fares are to be trialled in a bid to cut costs for commuters.", "doc_id": 3268, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "CrossCountry Trains, the main operator taking part in the trials, may eventually offer savings on other routes as well.", "explanation": "It says it is designed to cut costs and also save commuters money in other parts of the source, and it's also in trials.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

{"article": "Since then, the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine has been rolled out across 130 countries and halved the number of new cervical cancers. The HPV vaccine also protects against cancers in the throat and mouth in both men and women. Prof Ian Frazer said the vaccine could eradicate cancers caused by HPV within 40 years. \"It helps not only control cervical cancer but also the oropharyngeal cancer - the cancers inside the mouth that are caused by these viruses,\" Prof Frazer, chief executive of the Translational Research Institute, said. \"If we vaccinate enough people we will eliminate these viruses because they only infect humans. And in Australia there's already been a 90% reduction in infections in the 10 years the programme has been running.\" HPV is a very common virus that lives on our skin and other areas of the body, including the mouth, genital areas and anus. It can be passed through skin-to-skin contact and genital contact. The virus is most often passed during vaginal and anal sex, but can also be transmitted through oral sex. \"The papilloma viruses that cause cancer are very common indeed,\" Prof Frazer said. \"Most people get rid of the virus themselves without knowing they've contracted it, but 1% of the population that get it get persistent infection that lasts over five years. If they do that they've got a very good chance they'll get a cancer.\" Prof Frazer, the late molecular virologist Dr Jian Zhou and a research team used genetic engineering to build a virus replica to create the vaccine. With millions of doses of the vaccine administered worldwide, the number of new cases of cervical cancer has reportedly halved. \"We know that 170 million doses of vaccine have been given out,\" Prof Frazer said. \"If you do the sums on that, one in a hundred people were going to get a cancer that could kill them.\" Some parents have reservations about their children being vaccinated on the grounds that it may encourage promiscuity. Others object to vaccinations over safety fears. \"In countries like the US where the vaccine isn't so widely taken up, that's a little bit disappointing because cervical cancer still kills several thousand women in the US,\" he said. \"Then, of course, we've got the problem of the 250,000 people that die from cervical cancer in the developing world.\" Researchers are continuing to refine the effectiveness of the vaccine and ensure more widespread inoculation. \"We're moving from a vaccine that protects against two common strains of the virus that cause cancer to a vaccine that protects against nine common strains,\" Prof Frazer said. \"If we get that rolled out we will eventually get rid of all cancers that get caused by this virus.\"", "abstract": "The world's first cancer vaccine was administered in Australia exactly 10 years ago.", "candidate": "The world's first vaccine against a virus that causes cervical cancer was developed in Australia 10 years ago.", "doc_id": 3489, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "The HPV vaccine has reduced infections by 90% in 10 years in Australia.", "evidence": "And in Australia there's already been a 90% reduction in infections in the 10 years the programme has been running.\"", "explanation": "the original summary's statements are not supported by the source text, which does not mention where and when the vaccine was developed.", "instruction": "Rewrite the summary by using info from the source text to reflect the facts it mentions.", "instruction_list": ["Rewrite the summary by using info from the source text to reflect the facts it mentions."]}}

But scientists at the University of Adelaide and Flinders University have discovered it contains a hormone that could help treat diabetes. Known as GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1), it is also found in humans and other animals, where it promotes insulin release, lowering blood glucose levels. But it normally degrades very quickly.

{"article": "Last year 10.5% of all absences were down to holidays not agreed by schools - compared with 1.3% in 2011-12. Welsh schools can authorise up to 10 days of absences per pupil, per year. The Welsh Government said it was reviewing Welsh councils' use of fines to punish parents who break the rules. Last year, then education minister Huw Lewis wrote to councils to say it was wrong to tell head teachers to ban all term-time leave after thousands of parents signed a petition against the \u00c2\u00a360 penalties. The number of children aged between five and 11 being removed from class for term-time holidays, without permission, has risen every year since records detailing them began in 2011-12. The number of half day sessions missed due to unauthorised holiday absences rose from 58,089 in 2011-12 to 424,760 in 2015-16. However, because the number of authorised holidays has fallen over the same period, the total number of holiday absences has fallen from 920,500 to 788,841. Mark Biltcliffe, head teacher of Drury Primary School in Flintshire and president of the National Association of Head Teachers in Wales, called for government-regulated tax incentives to discourage holiday companies from hiking up prices outside of term time. \"If people have got two or three children it is extremely expensive to go away on holiday, I think that needs looking at. \"There should be pressure on the holiday industry so they can't make these huge profits.\" He told Good Morning Wales parents often asked for worksheets so children could keep up with what they are missing, but it was \"not the same\". \"Children do need to be in school every day and if they are not there then they're missing out on the teaching output and mixing with their friends . \"It's about continuity and the input of the lesson, it's not the same doing worksheets on a beach in Spain.\" In 2011-12, unauthorised holidays accounted for 1.3% of all absences, this increased to 10.5% in 2015-16, according to Welsh Government statistics. During the same period, authorised holidays by primary school children in term-time decreased, from 19.3% in 2011-12 to 9% in 2015-16. The percentage of secondary school pupils being taken out of class for holidays, without permission, increased from 0.8% to 3.6% in the same period. Professor Ken Reid, former chairman of the Welsh Government's national review into behaviour and attendance, said missing 10 days of school every year would equal nearly a year's worth of work by the end of their school career - which he called \"unacceptable\" and \"dangerous\". A Welsh Government spokesman said overall attendance figures were improving, with the number of secondary school pupils in Wales classed as \"persistent absentees\" - those who miss the equivalent of five weeks off - at an all time low in 2015-16. He said: \"Despite this progress, we can't afford to be complacent and will continue to act to improve attendance in all of our schools. \"Fixed penalty notices can be issued to address regular non-attendance at school and local authorities should have robust evidence before issuing a penalty.\" Gareth Evans, director of education policy at the University of South Wales Trinity St Davids, said while improvements in overall absences were an encouraging sign, more needed to be done to stop children missing class.

{"article": "Staff were informed of the development on Friday by chief executive officer Thomas Mayer, a source told BBC Sport. Administrators FRP said there was \"a very limited window of opportunity\" to save the team before the start of the 2017 season in Australia on 26 March. FRP said it was \"assessing options\" and that the process affected Manor's operating company Just Racing Services. Manor Grand Prix Racing, which owns the rights to the team's participation in F1, is not in administration. Team owner Stephen Fitzpatrick said in a note to staff: \"It was imperative that the team finish in 10th place or better in 2016.\" Manor, who finished 11th and last in the championship last season, have been in talks with new investors but so far no deal has been concluded. Administrator Geoff Rowley said: \"The team has made significant progress since the start of 2015, but the position remains that operating a F1 team requires significant ongoing investment. \"The senior management team has worked tirelessly to bring new investment, but regrettably has been unable to do so within the time available. \"Therefore, they have been left with no alternative but to place [Manor Racing] into administration.\" A source said several buyers had been lined up over the past few weeks and two had gone as far as conducting a due diligence process. But none of them provided the funds necessary to buy the team, nor was there any proof they had the money to run it. Fitzpatrick, the boss of the energy company Ovo, decided to put the team into administration on Thursday night. FRP were also appointed the last time the team were in administration over the winter of 2014/15, after they collapsed with debts of \u00a335m. At the time, they were known as Marussia, and were reconstituted under their original name of Manor when Fitzpatrick bought them at the 11th hour just before the 2015 season. Manor, who are based in Banbury in Oxfordshire, suffered a blow at the end of last season when Sauber moved ahead of them into 10th place in the constructors' championship thanks to the ninth place achieved by Felipe Nasr at the penultimate race of the year in Brazil. \"For much of the season we were on track,\" said Fitzpatrick. \"But the dramatic race in Brazil ended our hopes of [finishing 10th] and ultimately brought into doubt the team's ability to race in 2017. \"We made a huge amount of progress on and off track but ultimately it was not enough.\" That cost Manor in the region of \u00a310m in prize money - income they needed to survive into the new season - and the loss of it has made potential drivers and their backers reluctant to commit funds to the team, sources said. Fitzpatrick said at the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi that the loss of income was \"not a deal-breaker\" in the talks he was having with new investors.

{"article": "The opening session of the Scottish Parliament was largely devoted to ceremony, including swearing in MSPs and electing the presiding officer. Members found time to lodge 51 questions and motions - 28 of them from Willie Rennie on the China agreement. There was controversy about the issue during the election campaign. It emerged during the election period that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had signed the memorandum, potentially worth up to \u00c2\u00a310bn of investment, with SinoFortone and China Railway No 3 Engineering Group. At the time, Lib Dem leader Mr Rennie called for the agreement to be torn up after a parent firm of the engineering group had been blacklisted by Norway's state pension fund over fears of \"gross corruption\". Fears have also been voiced about human rights abuses. Ms Sturgeon said no firm investment plans had been made and insisted that due diligence would be carried out, although a UK advisor to the Chinese firms said specific projects had been discussed and claimed Ms Sturgeon wanted work to begin \"this year\". Mr Rennie lodged a total of 28 questions, all on the topic of the China agreement and government memoranda of understanding. He asked a series of questions about whether government officials were aware of the Norwegian blacklisting, their assessment of the firm's human rights record, what advice was taken before signing the memorandum, and whether the government would suspend the memorandum until it had investigated concerns. The Scottish Parliament website indicated that the questions were likely to be answered on 26 May. Ms Sturgeon has previously said that \"if there were any concerns that said these were deals we should not do, then we wouldn't do them\". A number of other MSPs also lodged questions on their first day back at work after the election. Labour MSP Neil Findlay submitted three motions, one of them on the \"growing number of Scottish citizens identified as being involved in undercover policing scandals\". His motion calls on the UK government to extend the Pitchford inquiry into undercover policing into Scotland, and says that if it does not, the Scottish government should set up an inquiry of its own. Mr Findlay also submitted a motion to welcome the verdict of the Hillsborough inquests, and another calling for directors of companies that take part in blacklisting to be tried in court. Green MSP Mark Ruskell, who has now returned to parliament having lost his seat in 2011, lodged 13 questions on his first day back in the job.

{"article": "More than two-thirds of those who took part in the poll opposed replacing the current method for electing MPs with the alternative vote (AV) system. Mr Clegg told the BBC the result was \"very clear\" and promised to \"move on\". The No to AV campaign said voters had safeguarded first-past-the-post \"for the next generation\". More than 19 million people took part in the referendum on whether to keep first-past-the-post, where voters put a cross next to their preferred candidate, with AV, which sees candidates ranked in order of preference. These preferences could have been used to decide the outcome in constituencies where no candidate wins more than 50% of votes cast. The Conservatives backed keeping the existing system, while Mr Clegg's Liberal Democrats urged change and Labour was split on the issue. Overall turnout for Thursday's referendum was 42%, with 6,152,607 voters backing the proposal and 13,013,123 rejecting it . Mr Clegg said: \"I wish I could say this is a photo finish but it isn't and the result is very clear. \"I'm a passionate supporter of electoral reform but we've got to accept this. If, in a democracy, you ask someone a question and get an overwhelming answer, you just have to move on.\" He added: \"This is a bitter blow for all those people like me who believe in the need for political reform.\" Prime Minister David Cameron said the referendum was always going to be a \"difficult moment\" for the Tory-Lib Dem coalition, but added that the result had been \"clear\". He added that the government would continue to deal with the problems facing the UK in a \"decisive\" way. Labour leader Ed Miliband, who supported a move to AV, said the public had \"delivered a clear verdict which I accept\". But he said elections still had to change in a way which made \"people feel more included in our politics\". The AV referendum campaign has been marked by strong words of criticism between the two camps. In a speech accepting his side's victory, No to AV campaign chairman Matthew Elliott said the result was \"clear signal from every part of the country that people want to keep our simple, fair and effective system for electing MPs\". He added: \"I personally believe this result will settle the debate about changing our electoral system for the next generation.\" However, Katie Ghose, who ran the Yes to Fairer Votes campaign, which called for AV, said: \"The referendum hasn't been the debate on issues of democracy that people would have hoped for. \"Too often the debate has been about party politics and the public has been shut out of discussing how we choose our MPs.\" She added: \"Over five million people voted for change - a tribute to our campaigners.\"", "abstract": "The public's overwhelming rejection of a change in the voting system is a \"bitter blow\", Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has said.", "candidate": "Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg has said the result of the referendum on electoral reform is a \"bitter blow\" for his party.", "doc_id": 3046, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Liberal Democrat leader Clegg has said the result of the referendum on electoral reform is a \"bitter blow\" for his party.", "evidence": "He added: \"This is a bitter blow for all those people like me who believe in the need for political reform.\"", "explanation": "it makes up his first name", "instruction": "Remove the information about his first name from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about his first name from the summary."]}}

{"article": "The announcement came at the annual meeting of the International Football Association Board (Ifab) on Friday. Ifab is also reviewing the order of penalty shootouts, as there is a \"clear advantage\" to going first. It also confirmed that clubs will be allowed to use a fourth substitute during extra time from the quarter-finals of this season's FA Cup. Proposals for sin-bins for yellow-card offences and rolling substitutions at lower levels of football, to be introduced from June, were also approved at the Wembley meeting. It is a move to \"encourage more people to take part\" in youth and amateur leagues. Ifab is made up of world governing body Fifa and the four British home associations - the FAs of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - and is responsible for deciding on law changes. Friday's meeting, which was chaired by Football Association chief executive Martin Glenn, also agreed a strategy to improve player behaviour. That could lead to captains being the only players permitted to speak to referees about \"major incidents\". The FA Cup quarter-finals will take place from 11-13 March, including Manchester United's Monday night trip to Premier League leaders Chelsea. The trial of a fourth substitute in extra time is a first in England, though the format was used at last year's Copa America and the Rio Olympics. Glenn said the rule change will bring \"extra intrigue and interest\" to the ties. \"From a technical point of view, it will be interesting to see how managers use the chance to make an additional substitution in such high-profile games and the impact it has on the final result,\" he added. Fifa president Gianni Infantino attended Friday's meeting and said the aim is for video assistant referees to be used at the World Cup in Russia next year. He confirmed the technology will be used at this June's Confederations Cup and May's Under-20 World Cup. Video assistant referees will review \"match-changing\" situations before informing the on-field official. Video replays were first used at international level during a friendly between Italy and France in September and then again during an friendly between Italy and Germany in November. The system has been tested in six other countries, including in the third-tier United Soccer League in America and the Dutch Cup. Its first use in a Fifa competition was during December's Club World Cup. Glenn said it would be too early for the technology to be used at August's Community Shield. He added it was a question of \"when, not if\" the system is introduced to English football. Ifab is considering changing penalty shootouts, citing the example of a tennis tie-break to combat the \"statistically proven advantage\" of the team that goes first. Teams alternate in shootouts, but Ifab says research shows the first team taking kicks has a 60% chance of winning. It is seeking trials in the lower levels of football that would see one team take the first penalty, then the teams alternate two kicks at a time. \"We believe that approach could remove that statistical bias and this is something that we will now look to trial,\" said Scottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan. BBC Radio 5 live sports news correspondent Richard Conway . The game's global lawmakers say they want to improve player behaviour and give referees a helping hand. Team captains will be asked to take on a greater leadership role, something the Premier League has encouraged for a number of years. The men and women who stand guard over football's law have approved a package of measures including sin-bins for yellow-card offences in amateur football. A greater use of technology is planned, sensors to determine if a goal has been scored are already in use, but experiments with video replays will now be extended to decide other contentious decisions. Many sports such as rugby have a long established culture of respect, now football wants to follow suit.

Suspected fire starters, some as young as 11, have been arrested for deliberately sparking fires which have reduced vast swathes of land to ash. Crimestoppers has offered \u00c2\u00a35,000 for information on a series of attacks. The fires were lit across Rhondda Cynon Taf and Merthyr. South Wales Fire Service's fire crime unit station manager Emma Bushell said: \"It's definitely not risk-free fun, because of the risks to the community, to wild life and to flora and fauna. \"It could have a catastrophic effect for people in the community.\" Ms Bushell said the service had received more than 8,000 calls in March and April - the third largest amount it has handled for this period in 15 years. However, she added: \"In reality, it is not any worse that it was in previous years.\" This year's 900 reported grass fires incidents is more than the 580 reported in 2014, but less than 2,500 in 2010 and 1,700 in 2011. \"It's a historic problem in Wales that people have always started grass fires. People are used to seeing the area black at this time of the year and the community has never really got up in arms about it,\" Ms Bushell added. \"It seems, because of the media coverage and the social media coverage this year, the community is actually saying, 'We want this to stop', which is brilliant.\" Ms Bushell said it was more important than ever the public reported fire starters and gave evidence, such as CCTV footage, to the police to make sure they were brought to book. This year's fires have been exacerbated by a lack of rain and the build up of bracken and foliage which has not been burnt in previous, wetter years. Such blazes are a UK-wide problem, but Ms Bushell said the south Wales valleys, with their easily accessible mountains, were particularly prone. She said fire service efforts to educate people about the dangers of grass fires were not enough, adding: \"We need to see more prosecutions.\" \"People have traditionally said it's young kids but in my experience it's not,\" she added, pointing out that adults as old as 35 had been arrested over the latest slew of alleged offences. \"I know that our chief fire officer is keen to get involved in some work profiling the people being caught so that we can target out education and awareness [campaigns],\" she added.

The search followed a distress call on Wednesday from a vessel which said it had 150 people on board. Indonesian teams had searched the waters, but could not locate the boat. The country's search and rescue agency, Basarnas, sent two boats and a helicopter to the area on Wednesday but found nothing and returned to base. But on Thursday a merchant vessel said it had found six people in the water, and more survivors were rescued during the day. \"Three survivors have serious injuries, but are in a stable condition.

That was the second boat to sink in a week, reigniting the debate on asylum in parliament.

Mrs O'Neill will have just five weeks to prepare for an election after Stormont's power-sharing coalition fell apart over a botched energy scheme scandal. The fallout from the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal, which is approximately \u00a3490m over budget, led to Mr McGuinness' quitting after DUP leader Arlene Foster refused to stand aside as first minster while an investigation was carried out. As they hold a joint office, his resignation automatically put Mrs Foster out of her job and prompted the calling of snap elections on 2 March. Mrs O'Neill described her new role as \"the biggest honour and privilege of my life\". \"I have never been afraid of challenge and I have never been afraid to act,\" she added. She referred to her first act as health minister last year, when she ended Northern Ireland's blanket ban on gay men donating blood. Mr McGuinness said he was \"overjoyed\" at her appointment, which he said was part of a \"generational change\" within his party. He said that as health minister she had already taken on one of Stormont's toughest portfolios, adding that Sinn F\u00e9in did not appoint people to such ministerial posts unless they had the \"all-round ability to manage very difficult situations\". Tackling mounting hospital waiting lists has been a huge task for Mrs O'Neill since she was appointed health minister last May. In October, she launched a 10-year plan to transform the health service, saying it would improve a system that was at \"breaking point\". Opposition politicians questioned the lack of details in the plan, which was not costed. But it set out a range of priorities, including a new model of care involving a team of professionals based around GP surgeries.

She has worked for the party since 1998, initially as political adviser to MP and former MLA Francie Molloy, before being elected to Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council in 2005. In 2011, she was appointed as minister for agriculture and rural development. The following year, she announced the department would move to a former British army barracks in Ballykelly, County Londonderry.

{"article": "The cardboard boxes also include a mattress and can be used for babies to sleep in as an alternative to a crib. The Scottish government hopes the boxes will help ensure every baby is given the best possible start in life. Baby boxes are already given out by some health authorities in other parts of the UK. But the Scotland-wide rollout, which follows successful pilot projects in Orkney and Clackmannanshire, is the first time they will be available to all expecting mothers in one part of the country. The Scottish government has given assurances that all of its baby boxes meet the highest UK safety standards for sleeping, with safe sleep guidance provided in a leaflet inside the box and safety guidelines also printed on the lid. It follows concerns raised earlier this month by cot death charity The Lullaby Trust, whose chief executive Francine Bates said she was unhappy with some boxes being marketed as products which will reduce infant mortality and SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome). Lynsay Allan, executive director of the Scottish Cot Death Trust, said: \"I am encouraged by the fact that Scotland's baby box scheme is prompting parents to think about their sleeping practices. \"While the proven safest place for a baby to sleep is in a cot, crib or Moses basket, I also recognise that the box can be used as a safe sleep space for newborn babies, particularly where families may have no alternative and where they might otherwise unsafely share their bed or sleep on a sofa or chair with their baby.\" Expectant mothers due to give birth on or after 15 August have been able to register to receive their baby box at midwife appointments since June. The boxes will be sent to the mother's home address or another preferred location from today. From January of next year, the baby boxes will be delivered at least four weeks before the baby's due date. Colleen Groves, a mum-to-be who will be receiving one, told BBC Scotland: \"I really like the idea of it being a safe sleeping space. \"I would probably use it more during the day, rather than at night-time. I would use it as a sort of living space for putting down for naps during the day. \"I think it is really nice that every baby is being given the same start and being given the same things. \"It's up to the parents whether they take the box or not because you do register for it. It's up to each individual to decide whether they want to make use of it or not.\" Early Years Minister Mark McDonald said the Scottish government would continue to monitor feedback as the baby boxes reach more families, and would work with parents and healthcare professionals to keep the contents under review. And he said the boxes, which have largely been based on a similar scheme in Finland, were just one of a range of measures the government was using to help babies and parents thrive in the crucial early months. Scotland's chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, said the boxes would also offer healthcare professionals a unique opportunity to introduce expectant parents to a wide range of health promotion information. Prof Russell Viner of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said child health in Scotland was among the worst in western Europe - with about 400 infants, children and young people dying each year, a significant number of which were potentially avoidable. But he said evidence into the effectiveness of baby boxes in reducing child mortality was \"limited\". Prof Viner added: \"Therefore the initiative must be carefully evaluated and delivered alongside other policies. \"These include ensuring universal early-years public health services such as health visitors are prioritised, supported and properly funded, with targeted help for children and families living in poverty. \"Combining these efforts will improve child health and help bring Scotland's mortality rates into line with the best performing countries in Europe.\" The Scottish government's poverty advisor, Naomi Eisenstadt, said that the boxes might be welcome for parents in poverty, but questioned whether offering them as a universal benefit was the best use of public money.", "abstract": "Baby boxes containing essential items such as clothes, books and blankets are to be delivered to new mothers across Scotland for the first time.", "candidate": "Every mother-to-be in Scotland is to be given a \"baby box\" which can be used as a safe sleeping space.", "doc_id": 2881, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "The boxes will be sent to the mother's home address or another preferred location from today.", "explanation": "It says in the source every mother to be will receive one sent to them at home and also a mum to be said to BBC Scotland that she likes the idea of a safe sleeping space.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

{"article": "The US company says the \"limited edition\" Toq is designed to showcase its new technologies rather than compete with its other products. Qualcomm is best known for making processors that power smartphones. However, one analyst suggested the device was too bulky to appeal beyond a niche enthusiast audience. The $349 (\u00c2\u00a3215) gadget is being made available via only Qualcomm's website to US customers, and the company said it was \"unlikely\" it would sell the watch elsewhere. The Toq is designed to be paired with any smartphone running Android 4.0.3 or higher. It allows its owner to receive and send text messages, manage reminders and view other information - such as weather forecasts or stock prices - obtained via their handset. There is no software store for the watch itself, but existing handset apps can be adapted to send details to its display and activate a vibrate function. In addition it can be used to accept or reject calls, and control what music is being played from the linked phone's library. The company says that the watch's key innovation is its use of its proprietary Mirasol technology. Rob Chandok, president of Qualcomm Interactive Platforms, described this as being similar to the e-ink displays commonly used by e-book readers and another smartwatch - the Pebble - but better. \"In addition to the fact it offers colour, the refresh rate of Mirasol can be 30 frames a second, which allows you to build a touch interface,\" he told the BBC. \"That's tremendously important when you are trying to offer some of these experiences. \"In an e-ink display you can't refresh the screen fast enough to follow the finger.\" Mirasol is significantly less power-hungry than the OLED tech used by Samsung's Galaxy Gear watch, meaning that unlike its rival, its screen does not have to turn itself off when angled away from the user's face to extend battery life. Sony's Smartwatch 2 does offer an always-on LCD display - however, it requires the user to switch on a backlight in dim conditions. Although Qualcomm suggests the Toq's lack of an on/off switch makes it the superior option, Mr Chandok acknowledged that the Toq display's graphics were not as vibrant or crisp as the alternatives. \"But we've got other versions of Mirasol in the pipeline that are going to have a better colour gamut and vibrancy,\" he added. Qualcomm has also included three other technologies it has developed that it hopes will attract the attention of manufacturers: . Mr Chandok said \"tens of thousands, but not hundreds of thousands\" of the watches were being produced, adding that its appeal was likely to be limited to an \"early adopter\" crowd. \"We would consider making more if the demand were high,\" he said. \"But our preference is for our partners to bring out products [using the new technologies] in the next six months, and we're working hard with a few people to do that.\" He declined to name the companies involved, but did reveal that in theory the Toq could be made compatible with Apple's iPhones. \"We limited the spend on what we were doing and just built the applications on the Android side,\" he said. \"There's nothing keeping us from doing an iOS app, we just haven't invested in that.\" Many analysts believe the market in smartwatches and other wearable technologies - such as Google's Glass eyewear - has the potential for huge growth. The research firm NextMarket Insights has predicted 373 million smartwatches will be shipped in 2020 compared with fewer than one million this year. However, one expert warned that Qualcomm and others had to make major improvements to achieve such numbers. \"They are still relatively bulky in watch terms and you still have issues with recharging, which is an alien concept to people with watches,\" said Chris Green, an analyst at the consultants Davies Murphy Group. \"The Toq offers a little bit more than some of the other smartwatches in terms of what it can do, but it's still ultimately a basic thing offering little more than a second screen, and is quite gimmicky. \"We've still to see anyone offer a smartwatch that delivers something that we actually need.\"", "abstract": "Qualcomm has released a smartwatch that it says can last days between recharges despite the fact its touchscreen display is always on.", "candidate": "Qualcomm has launched what it claims is the world's first Android-powered smartwatch.", "doc_id": 1695, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "Qualcomm has launched an Android-powered smartwatch.", "evidence": "The $349 (\u00c2\u00a3215) gadget is being made available via only Qualcomm's website to US customers, and the company said it was \"unlikely\" it would sell the watch elsewhere.", "explanation": "it makes up it being the first smartwatch using andriod", "instruction": "Remove the information about it being the world's first android-powered smartwatch from the summary.", "instruction_list": ["Remove the information about it being the world's first android-powered smartwatch from the summary."]}}
{"article": "IS \"fired at everything that moved\" after entering on Thursday, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. A separate IS attack on the north-eastern city of Hassakeh has displaced 60,000 people, the UN says. Kobane became a symbol of Kurdish resistance in January after an IS siege lasting several months was repelled. IS launched an apparent two-pronged offensive on Thursday after Kurdish fighters from the Popular Protection Units (YPG) cut off one of the militants' major supply routes near Raqqa. Raqqa is the de facto capital of the IS \"caliphate\", whose creation IS announced a year ago after it captured large swathes of northern and western Iraq and parts of Syria. \"According to medical sources and Kobane residents, 120 civilians were executed by IS in their homes or killed by the group's rockets or snipers,\" said Rami Abdel Rahman, who heads the UK-based Observatory. He said women and children were among the bodies found inside houses and on the streets of the town, which is close to the border with Turkey. He described it as one of the biggest massacres by the group in the country since its offensive began last summer. The militants took the town by surprise when they launched their attack on Thursday, five months after IS was removed by Kurdish fighters backed by US-led coalition strikes. The attack at dawn on Thursday began when militants detonated a car bomb, followed by two more bombings. Reports said some of the militants may have hidden themselves among returning refugees and disguised themselves by wearing Kurdish militia uniforms. In a nearby village, IS reportedly shot dead at least 20 civilians, including women and children. Activists say clashes between some IS militants and the Kurdish YPG forces are continuing in the town. Separately on Friday, the UN said an estimated 50,000 people had been displaced within the city of Hassakeh after another IS offensive there. Another 10,000 have fled northwards towards a town near the Turkish border, it added. Hassakeh, about 270km (180 miles) east of Kobane, has been under the control of both government forces and Kurdish fighters, and IS militants have been trying to capture it for months.

{"article": "Morpeth beat Hereford FC 4-1 to become the seventh Northern League side to win the FA Vase in eight years. Hereford went ahead after 75 seconds through Rob Purdie's 25-yard shot, but Morpeth rallied to clinch victory. In the FA Trophy final, Scott McManus scored the only goal of the game as Halifax beat promoted Grimsby 1-0 in their first visit to the stadium. Grimsby Town were at Wembley for the second time in eight days, having won promotion back to the football league after a six-year absence with last weekend's victory over Forest Green in the National League promotion final. But it was Halifax Town, recently relegated to National League North and on their first trip to Wembley, who started the brighter with McManus sending a curling free-kick over the bar. Following a first half in which neither keeper was really tested, McManus scored the game's only goal in the 48th minute. The 26-year old sent the 10,000 Halifax Town fans wild when he lobbed Town keeper James McKeown from 25 yards. The Mariners upped their intensity, almost grabbing an equaliser in added time, but Halifax cleared off the line to hold on for a famous victory. In their first season in their new existence, following the demise of wound-up Hereford United in December 2014, Peter Beadle's reformed Bulls had already won three trophies this season - notably winning the Midland League at their first attempt. Hereford had three players on show - Purdie, Ryan Green and skipper Joel Edwards - who also used to play for the Bulls in their Hereford United days. After Purdie's explosive early opener, roared on by more than 20,000 travelling fans, the Bulls dominated the first half, hitting the bar and wasting a string of other first-half chances. But the game turned on 45-year-old Chris Swailes' leveller when he chested in after a goalkeeping error to become the oldest scorer in a Wembley final and it triggered the Highwaymen into action. Luke Carr scored from close range straight after the break, followed by further goals from Sean Taylor and Shaun Bell to earn Morpeth their first FA Vase triumph. That earned veteran former Ipswich, Bury and Rotherham defender Swailes his third winner's medal, having won the competition in 1993 with Bridlington Town and in 2012, with another north-east side, Dunston. And, in the end, they deservedly maintained the Northern League's recent stranglehold on this competition. which began with Whitley Bay's triumph in 2008-09. Grimsby Town manager Paul Hurst told BBC Radio Humberside: . \"We didn't get the icing on the cake, that's all I would say. Congratulations to Halifax, they played very well.\" \"We had our day last week. Its a learning curve for us all.

{"article": "The contents of 56 safe deposit boxes were taken during the raid in London's jewellery district over Easter weekend. Twelve addresses in the London and Kent area were raided by about 200 police officers on Tuesday morning. Nine men were arrested and a number of high-value items were recovered, police said. Searches of the houses are ongoing. Scotland Yard first arrested seven men, aged between 48 and 76. They later arrested a 58-year-old man and a 43-year-old, bringing the total number of men arrested to nine. Police have also appealed for information on a white Transit van seen in the area at the time of the raid. The van, with a registration of DU53 VNG, was caught twice on CCTV during the Easter heist. During a press conference, the Met said it felt officers had been portrayed as the Keystone Kops, while a relative of a victim said finding some of the haul could actually make things worse for those affected, as it could delay insurance pay-outs. Thieves used heavy cutting equipment to break into a vault at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd, where they ransacked about 70 boxes. The men were arrested in Enfield, east London and Dartford. Police said bags containing a significant amount of high-value property were recovered at one of the addresses and they were confident some were items stolen during the burglary. Head of the Met's Flying Squad, Det Supt Craig Turner, urged victims of the crime to \"stay patient\", adding police officers would be in contact with them in order \"to restore this property back to its rightful owners\". He said the investigation had been \"complex and exceptional\". In response to questions about why police did not respond to an alarm that went off at the premises during the time of the heist, Det Supt Turner, said: \"We are now in a position to confirm that on this occasion our call handling system and procedures for working with the alarm monitoring companies were not followed. \"Our normal procedures would have resulted in police attending the scene and we apologise that this did not happen.\" There has been no official detail of what was stolen but it is believed jewellery worth up to \u00a3200m was taken during the raid. Cdr Peter Spindler said: \"At times we have been portrayed as if we've acted like Keystone Kops. \"But I want to reassure you that in the finest traditions of Scotland Yard, these detectives have done their utmost to bring justice for the victims of this callous crime.\" A relative of one of the victims said those affected were \"probably worse off after this morning's raids\". \"With the stolen goods vanished, there was pressure on insurance companies to settle quickly to enable holders to trade again,\" the relative, who did not want to be identified, said. \"But now, with a whole mess of stuff to sort out, it may drag on for months. \"If batches of the stones were mixed up, it may be impossible to reunite them with their owners.\" The biggest heist in the UK was carried out at a Securitas cash depot in Tonbridge, Kent, in 2006 when robbers stole almost \u00a353m in cash.

{"article": "What are the figures behind this? The number of police officers in England and Wales has already fallen by about 16,000 since 2010 because of cuts in Home Office funding. Labour's sums are based on assumptions about the amounts all unprotected government departments are likely to have to be cut to meet the targets for cutting the deficit, which were set out in the Budget. The Conservatives are yet to set out plans for the next three years of funding for the Home Office. Labour says it has identified \u00c2\u00a3800m of savings that could be made in police forces, which would prevent the loss of 10,000 jobs that it says the Conservatives would have to cut in the next three years. Labour's figures assume that all departments will be cut by the same amount. Of course, when the next government has its spending review, it could decide to make much more severe cuts to some departments than others. Labour says it will save \u00c2\u00a3800m by doing things such as scrapping the elections for police and crime commissioners, which are due to take place next year, and making people pay the full cost when they apply for a gun licence. The Conservatives respond that scrapping commissioners and other measures would not save as much as Labour claims and that they have already announced plans to increase the fees for gun licences. The biggest proposed savings come from making it compulsory for police forces to buy things together to increase their negotiating power. The Conservatives say that already happens in a lot of cases but that Labour has overestimated the potential savings. The Tories also point out that, despite the falls in police numbers over the past five years, crime has fallen. The two things may be unrelated and crime has been falling since the late 1990s. So it is difficult to demonstrate either that if the Conservatives were to win the election they would cut 10,000 police staff over the next three years or indeed that Labour's plans would prevent that happening. What this argument does highlight is how tight a timetable the next government will be working to. Departments only have spending plans laid out for a year from now. The previous government did not manage to have a spending review until 20 October 2010. There is frantic contingency planning going on all over the civil service.

{"article": "The academy said that nations were measuring their wealth by GDP (Gross Domestic Product), taking no account of the harm caused by business practises. It urged countries to act as stewards of God's creation. The statements are likely to influence the Pope's coming Encyclical on climate change. An Cambridge Economics professor, Partha Dasgupta, told the academy's climate conference in the Vatican: \"GDP is a disgraceful index because it does not count depreciation of our assets - including damage to Mother Nature, the most fundamental asset we have.\" Cardinal Peter Turkson, who helped write the coming Encyclical - an official statement - said: \"For humans to degrade the integrity of the Earth by constant changes in its climate; by stripping its natural forests; to contaminate Earth's water, land and air with poisonous substances - all of these are sins. \"There is an all-embracing imperative to protect our garden, our hope. We must move away from our unthinking infatuation with GDP.\" The academy heard speech after speech urging the moral case for protecting the climate for future generations. Meanwhile, a small group funded by a US climate contrarian body in Chicago has been in Rome rallying against the Vatican's climate drive. One of the participants, Christopher Monckton, said the Pope \"should listen to both sides of the scientific argument... not only people of one, narrow, poisonous political and scientific viewpoint\". Inside the conference itself, the astronomer Lord Rees, former President of the UK's Royal Society, was putting just such a balanced view. He acknowledged uncertainties over climate science, especially over how water vapour and clouds would react to warming. He said some people were willing to bet on a low level of warming, mitigated later in the century by new technologies more affordable in a richer economy. But, he said, the risks of triggering an irreversible catastrophe lasting thousands of years was too great. \"It would be shameful if our inheritance was a depleted and hazardous world,\" he said. The Church is hoping to make an impact in a year of key UN meetings on Sustainable Development Goals, development finance and climate. The Encyclical is expected to describe action to cut emissions as \"a moral and religious imperative, highlighting the intrinsic connection between respect for the environment and respect for people - especially the poor, children, and future generations\". The Pope is hoping to build agreement among all religions on the moral obligation to protect the environment. Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, who heads the Academy, said the Encyclical would not be the highest level of proclamation from the Pope, which is reserved for issues of Faith. But he said it was important for all the world's 1.2 billion Catholics to take it seriously. If any Catholic wanted to ignore it they would need \"very good reasons - based not on personal or political opinion, but on science\". For some Catholics, this may prove an unwelcome Papal intervention into a highly politicised subject. But the aid agency Cafod said its poll with YouGov showed the vast majority (70%) of Catholics say their community will heed the message of the Pope on climate change. Whether it will prove persuasive for American Republican lawmakers - around a third of whom are Catholic - is yet to be seen.

{"article": "Now, on the surface, these words from Michael Gove shouldn't be surprising. A minister wouldn't advertise disunity. The surprise though is that - as one of the most prominent Leave campaigners - he was talking about an implementation period post-Brexit which could last for an unspecified amount of time. Insiders say his arrival at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and dealing with the powerful farming lobby may have influenced his view. Some of the most prominent Remain ministers have been expressing relief - tinged in one case with just a hint of triumphalism - that they think in recent weeks that they have managed to sell the idea of a soft landing - or as some say \"no cliff edge\" - after the UK leaves the EU in 2019 to some of their more sceptical colleagues. So much for unity. Where do differences still lie? It was interesting that, in answering my question on whether freedom of movement would continue under an implementation period, that Michael Gove didn't rule this out. Migration, he argued, would be decided by the needs of the economy. But for how long? The tectonic plates may have moved on a transitional deal but its duration is where cabinet fault lines persist. Liam Fox has been pretty clear he doesn't want to contemplate anything more than two years. As one minister put it - he has waited forty years to leave the EU so two more won't matter. But anther prominent cabinet Brexiteer told me he thought it would be a \"disaster\" if the implementation period hadn't concluded by the assumed date of the next election in 2022 while others have talked about anything up to a four year period. Then what form will any transition take? Could there be temporary membership of the European Economic Area? Some leavers might be suspicious that temporary would become permanent. Should we stay in the customs union a bit longer until we hammer out a bespoke deal post Brexit? The EU is unlikely to get the clarity it seeks until there is clarity around the cabinet table.

{"article": "To give some idea of the amount of the currency that represents - there were more than 90 billion banknotes in circulation in India last March. Most central banks destroy soiled and mutilated banknotes on a regular basis and replace them with new, crisp ones. The Reserve Bank of India, similarly, shreds such notes and makes briquettes of them. But they are not your usual briquettes. Briquettes - usually made of farm waste in India - are used for cooking, lighting and heating. They are cheaper than coal, have lower ash content, are less polluting, and easier to store and pack. They are mostly used as fuel in factory boilers. But briquettes made out of shredded cash are brittle and serve no such purpose, a senior central bank official told me. So the bank's 27 shredding and briquetting machines in 19 offices across India will now snip the expired banknotes into the smallest of pieces and the resulting briquettes will be then dumped in India's vast landfills. Sometimes the shredded currency is also recycled to make files, calendars and paper weights and ballpoint pen shells, tea coasters, cups and small trays as souvenirs for guests. The practice is similar in the US: counterfeit banknotes are sent to the Secret Service, while unfit notes are shredded and sent to landfills or given away as souvenirs to the public touring the Federal Reserve Bank. Central bank officials believe shredding 20 billion banknotes will not be a huge challenge. In 2015-16 the Reserve Bank of India destroyed more than 16 billion soiled notes. More than 14 billion were removed in 2012-2013 after nearly 500,000 fake notes were found in the system. \"Destroying so much cash is not a challenge because we have enough shredding and briquetting machines with very high capacities.

Asian Americans make up 22.2%, followed by African Americans at 14.6%, Hispanic or Latino students at 11.6%, and Native American or Pacific Islanders at 2.5%. The milestone figures come just days after Harvard was drawn into a row over affirmative action between the US justice department and the New York Times. On 1 August, the paper claimed the justice department was preparing to sue campuses with affirmative action admissions policies, as it feels they are biased against white applicants. It said resources from the department's civil rights division would be used for the legal action, citing an internal memo. However, the justice department insisted it had no plans to investigate whether colleges pick their entrants based on race. It said the document seen by the paper, which referred to \"a new project on [...] intentional race-based discrimination\" was actually about a 2015 complaint by a coalition of Asian-American groups. The complaint accused Harvard and other Ivy League colleges of using quotas that keep out Asians with high test scores. Rachael Dane, a spokesperson for Harvard, said the university was \"committed to enrolling diverse classes of students\". \"To become leaders in our diverse society, students must have the ability to work with people from different backgrounds, life experiences, and perspectives,\" she said. \"Harvard's admissions process considers each applicant as a whole person, and we review many factors, consistent with the legal standards established by the US Supreme Court.\" The Supreme Court has outlawed the use of racial quotas in college admissions, but ruled that universities can consider race as part of a \"holistic review\" of applicants. Roger Clegg, president of the conservative Center for Equal Opportunity and a former top official in the justice department's civil rights division, told the BBC he felt affirmative action was outdated. \"I understand the visceral sense that African Americans have been treated badly in this country for a very long time, and right after we got rid of Jim Crow [segregation laws], it wasn't such a bad idea to give special consideration over someone who was a recent beneficiary of Jim Crow. But now we're in 2017. Jim Crow is long gone and we're talking about giving Latinos a preference over Asian Americans. What possible sense does that make?\" he said. An alternative view comes from Brenda Shum, director of the Educational Opportunities Project at the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.

He and other officials were accused by Washington of \"sustained and severe violations of human rights\". By Mohammad ManzarpourBBC Persian . Saeed Mortazavi's arrest could be considered a turning point in Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's tenure as Iran's Supreme Leader. Having risen from obscurity as a young judge, Mr Mortazavi was instrumental in the mass culling of reformist newspapers during former President Mohammad Khatami's administration. He later gained further notoriety for his involvement in the case of Zahra Kazemi, an Iranian-Canadian photojournalist who died in custody following her arrest in 2003. More recently, Mr Mortazavi was accused in connection with the abuse and killing of post-election protesters in the Kahrizak detention centre. It is unlikely that Mr Mortazavi's arrest could have come without the supreme leader's approval. Whatever red-line Mr Mortazavi may have crossed to trigger this chain of events, his arrest marks the end of an era of impunity, long enjoyed by the Islamic state's most loyal enforcers. Analysts say his arrest could be the result of disputes between President Ahmadinejad on one hand and parliament and the judiciary on the other. The arrest was \"possibly\" in connection with allegations of torture and the deaths of prisoners after the controversial 2009 election, Fars reported. A few days after he was removed last month as head of the social welfare fund, he was rehired by President Ahmadinejad, but this time as official caretaker of the same organisation, angering some lawmakers. While defending the former prosecutor in parliament, Mr Ahmadinejad accused the head of parliament and the head of the judiciary of corruption, which analysts say might be one of the reasons behind Mr Mortazavi's arrest. Mr Ahmadinejad's controversial re-election in 2009 - and the violent suppression of subsequent opposition protests - has widened the rift between conservatives and reformists within Iran's political establishment. Correspondents say parliament has been hostile to Mr Ahmadinejad for most of his second four-year term which expires in August.

{"article": "Yes I'm talking about dual candidacy. Here's my quick guide. Unlike at Westminster, there are two ways of getting elected for the assembly. There are 60 seats up for grabs next year. 40 are via the first past the post system, while the other 20 are via a form of proportional representation to get on the regional list. It used to be the case that you could stand in both. Then Labour, when it was in power, stopped it, making the argument that it rewarded failure in that someone could be rejected by voters under the first past the post system, only to be elected anyway on the regional list. The best example of this was Clwyd West in the assembly elections in 2003 when the four main parties fielded four candidates and every single one of them won because the three losers won a seat by also standing on their parties' regional list. The ban has been reversed since the Conservatives have been back in power at Westminster who argue that it disproportionately discriminates against the smaller parties in Wales. The result now is that it de-risks any attempt by big-hitters to go for first past the post seats because they can still have the back-up of getting a list seat even if they lose out in the constituency contest. The unwritten aim is also to maintain the quality of candidates by ensuring that those big hitters who do challenge still remain in the assembly. That is the background to the row about the confirmation of Leanne Wood's decision to go for a list seat. Two years ago she announced that she would go for the constituency seat in the Rhondda. It set up a contest against Labour's cabinet member Leighton Andrews in what will be the most high profile personal battle next year. Labour says the Plaid leader's decision two years ago was portrayed as a bold and brave move, which has not been reflected in the fact that she's going for the list seat as a back up. Leighton Andrews says she should have the courage of her convictions and only go for the constituency seat. In other words, her decision to go for the list is a cop out. In response, Leanne Wood has accused Labour of mischief-making, saying that Leighton Andrews himself stood as a dual candidate in 2003. She also makes the point that dual candidacy applies in Scotland. Labour says none of its candidates in Wales will be allowed to be constituency and list candidates. The Welsh Conservatives have yet to make that decision. The obvious question to answer is whether their leader Andrew RT Davies, who like Leanne Wood has only ever been elected on the list system, will feel confident enough to challenge Labour for the Vale of Glamorgan constituency seat. Now that the dual candidacy ban has been removed, he could do so knowing he could still put his name on the regional list. It must be a temptation for him to challenge, knowing that the Tories held on to this seat with a comfortable majority in the general election, but he'll also be aware of the risk for any party leader to come second in his or her home patch.", "abstract": "First we had it, then we didn't and now it's back again.", "candidate": "The row between Labour and Plaid Cymru over Leanne Wood's decision to stand for the regional list at next year's assembly election is about more than just who can stand.", "doc_id": 1742, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "The row between Labour and Plaid Cymru over Leanne Wood's decision to stand for the regional list at next year's assembly election is about more than just who can stand.", "evidence": "Labour, when it was in power, stopped it, making the argument that it rewarded failure in that someone could be rejected by voters under the first past the post system, only to be elected anyway on the regional list.", "explanation": "Leanne is correctly reported to stand for the regional list at next year's assembly election.

{"article": "The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and Faculties said staffing and leadership were particular concerns. It recommended the Scottish government and NHS boards agree minimum safe staffing levels for all professions in hospitals. The Scottish government said NHS staffing was at its highest-ever level. The academy set up a working group to look at how the health service could learn from past failures. It followed three previous reports into serious failings of care in the Scottish health service. They looked at problems of staffing and leadership at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary (ARI); above-average mortality rates at NHS Lanarkshire; and the worst-ever outbreak of C-difficile infection, at Vale of Leven Hospital. The academy's report, Learning from Serious Failings in Care, identified key issues to be addressed, including: . The working group was chaired by Prof Alan Paterson of Strathclyde University and involved senior experts from the Royal Colleges in Scotland. Prof Paterson said: \"It is clear that serious failings in team working between clinical staff and NHS management played a significant role in the failings in care identified. \"These failings are deep-rooted and systemic. They must not be ignored if we are to learn from them and to prevent repetition. \"It is also clear that a combination of factors led to some appalling failings in care, a loss of basic compassion and the prioritisation of inappropriate targets over patient care. In addition, leadership and accountability were all too often sadly lacking and bullying endemic. \"While there have been responses to the individual published reports of inquiries and reviews into failings in care, there is little evidence to suggest that we are tackling the underlying systemic failings which exist.\" The report recommended that hospital staffing levels should be based on \"best evidence\". It said priority should be given to developing minimum safe staffing for acute medicine and medicine for the elderly wards. Among its 20 recommendations was a suggestion that there should be less reliance on locum and agency staff, and a call for quality of care to be put ahead of meeting targets, . It also raised concerns about staff sickness, saying this could be an indication of deteriorating morale and should be used as \"an early warning system\". Royal College of Nursing Scotland Director Theresa Fyffe said: \"These are hard-hitting recommendations and will make uncomfortable reading for many managers and leaders in our health service.\" She added: \"Too often, failures in care are down to unsafe staffing levels. We know that quality of care is inextricably linked to having the right number of suitably skilled staff in the right place at the right time, with the right balance between registered nurses and unregistered staff. \"Having appropriately trained and experienced staff must be a priority for all health boards if they are to deliver safe, high quality care to patients.\" The Scottish government's national clinical director for healthcare quality, Prof Jason Leitch, said: \"We are committed to driving up standards in our NHS which is why we have led the way in responding to the reports detailed in the Scottish Academy's report. \"We are absolutely clear about the value we place on staff and the safe and effective service they deliver to patients. \"We currently have the highest staffing levels across our NHS than ever before, with increases under this government of over 1,300 more consultants, and 2,300 more qualified nurses and midwives.\" Prof Leitch added: \"We are constantly striving to further improve health care in Scotland and will review the recommendations within this report and take forward any learning that will benefit NHS Scotland, either as part of the follow up work to the Vale of Leven, Grampian and Lanarkshire reviews.\"", "abstract": "A body representing health professionals in Scotland has said major changes are needed to address \"systemic failures\" in the NHS.", "candidate": "A report into serious failings of care in Scotland's hospitals has highlighted \"deep-rooted and systemic\" problems.", "doc_id": 2914, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "\"These failings are deep-rooted and systemic.", "explanation": "it correctly pulls the info (Scotland, hospitals, description of problem, report, failings of care) from the source text", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

The pressure group said it meant, in some cases, the board risked breaking the law. The board said it was already working on measures to reduce risks. The findings of the annual safeguarding report were presented to officials at the health board last week. It outlined 13 'red' areas of risk, including: . The concerns by the NWHA come as the board meets on Thursday to get the latest update on two inquiries into events at Glan Clwyd Hospital's Tawel Fan ward, which closed in 2013. \"A year and a half after going into special measures and receiving additional support, we have to ask whether Betsi Cadwaladr is learning lessons and making improvements?\" stated Marc Jones, from the NWHA. \"These are not trivial issues but are serious risks. The scandal surrounding Tawel Fan should have been a wake-up call regarding the need to take at-risk patients' safety and well-being seriously. \"We do not want to see a repeat of that.\" The health board's own analysis of its safeguarding weaknesses highlighted \"unclear\" policies, little evidence of sharing good practice, and relatively low uptake on safeguarding training. In an independent investigation in May 2015, relatives said patients on the Tawel Fan ward were treated like animals in a zoo. It led to the health board being put into special measures by the Welsh Government, and its former chief executive stepped down. Betsi Cadwaladr board members will be told later that the current inquires into what happened are expected to continue until the summer.

{"article": "Passengers said it was \"chaotic\", with huge crowds snaking around corridors and a lack of senior staff. Airport operator BAA said UK Border Agency's service was \"completely unacceptable\" but queues were easing. The agency blamed the Easter holiday for the length of the queues. BAA said queues began easing after 13:00 BST with passengers in Terminal 5 having to wait the longest - 31 minutes for EU passengers and 51 minutes for Non-EU citizens. The shortest waiting time was in Terminal 4, where it took four minutes for passengers from the EU to clear the checks and two minutes for non-EU nationals. BAA said on Friday the longest wait passengers had was 77 minutes at Terminal 3, 75 minutes at Terminal 4, and 54 minutes at Terminals 5 and 1, with non-EU passengers facing the longest wait at the time. Matthew Donaldson, 38, from Lincolnshire, who arrived on a flight from Cape Town in South Africa at about 06:30, said he had to wait for an hour and 45 minutes to leave passport control at Terminal 5. He said: \"It was complete chaos. Half the escalators were closed to slow down the crowds and when we got to passport control there were snaking queues. \"They gave no reason and there were no senior staff there. \"It was erratic to say the least.\" George Galanopoulos, founder of London Executive Aviation which runs private jets, wrote on Twitter: \"Just landed at Heathrow T5... total chaos! Embarrassing for London.\" Simon Baugh, director of media relations at BAA, said the earlier situation at passport control, which is managed by the UK Border Force, the section of the UK Border Agency in charge of entry to the UK, was \"fairly typical\" but \"completely unacceptable\". He said: \"It's the UK's reputation and BAA's that suffers. There's no need for it. \"It's entirely about the level of resourcing the government needs to put in place.\" A UK Border Agency spokeswoman said: \"We will not compromise border security but we always aim to keep disruption to a minimum by using our staff flexibly to meet demand.\" She said there were extra workers at the border over the Easter period. Culture Select Committee chairman John Whittingdale outlined his committee's concerns about the airport's service in a letter to Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Jeremy Hunt which was made public this week. The letter, dated 21 March, said waits in excess of an hour might deter tourists from returning to the UK. The government sets BAA targets for processing departing passengers through security but no contractual service level agreements are in place for arriving passengers, said Mr Baugh. He said the Home Office sets an \"aspirational\" waiting time of no longer than 45 minutes for non-EU passengers and 25 minutes for EU passengers.

{"article": "Sources earlier told BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw that one wing of HMP The Mount in Hertfordshire and half of another wing had been \"lost\". The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) later said the incident was \"resolved\" and no staff or prisoners had been injured. A report into the jail published earlier highlighted staffing problems and said violence was an issue. The Mount, in Bovingdon village near Hemel Hempstead, opened in 1987 and is classed as a category C male prison. A \"tornado team\" made up of riot-trained staff arrived at the jail at about 18:30, equipped with shields and batons while fire, police and ambulance crews were on standby outside. The MoJ said officers had dealt with an \"incident involving a number of prisoners\". The BBC understands the wings involved were H and L, which house 110 and 117 prisoners. At about 23:45, a Prison Service spokesperson said: \"Specialist prison staff resolved an incident involving a number of prisoners. There were no injuries to staff or prisoners. \"The offenders responsible will be referred to the police and could spend longer behind bars.\" Earlier on Monday, the Independent Monitoring Board published its annual review into conditions at Mount Prison and said it had \"struggled\" with staff shortages. There were 24 vacancies out of a total of 136 officers in February, it added. It also claimed violence \"grew considerably\" throughout the year and that drugs were readily available, in particular the synthetic cannabis substitute spice. The report says concerns raised last year had not been addressed by the MoJ. The Prison Reform Trust calls this type of institution one where \"prison staff think [inmates] will not escape\", while acknowledging they \"cannot be trusted in an open prison\". Prison affairs academic and blogger Alex Cavendish had tweeted on Saturday: \"Staff shortages at HMP The Mount (Herts) are so severe that this is the 3rd weekend of total lockdown. Meals given at cell door. Trouble brewing.\" Mark Fairhurst, of the Prison Officers Association, said staff shortages in UK jails were \"an epidemic\" and partly due to \"poor salaries\". \"We need to increase the starting salary to incentivise people to join and then we need to give them regular increments to incentivise them to stay,\" he said. Mr Fairhurst added it was difficult to retain staff because of \"adverse working conditions, the violence they face and poor salary\". The Mount is built on a former RAF station site and has more than 1,000 prisoners, according to the MoJ. It is described as a \"hybrid training and resettlement prison\" for inmates in the final six months of their sentences. A 2015 inspection of the prison found The Mount was \"reasonably safe and felt calm and well ordered\", but chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick added that there was \"room for improvement\".

{"article": "The \u00a3300m re-signalling project affected Cardiff and Valley line services and mainline travel between Newport and Bridgend from Christmas Eve until 2 January. Passengers experienced \"severe delays\" and cancellations from Thursday after engineering works over ran. Network Rail said the lines have now been handed back to rail operators. The project also saw a new platform eight open at Cardiff Central station on Monday - which will allow more trains to arrive at the station at any one time. It has been designed to ease congestion and will be used by passengers travelling on lines to Penarth, Barry Island and destinations in the Vale of Glamorgan. The positive effects were already being felt by commuters on Tuesday. Peter Clarke, who lives near Reading but stays in south Wales during the week while working in Cardiff, even missed work over the festive period as he was worried about the effects of rail alterations. The works on top of weekday train delays meant he \"couldn't face it\" and he lost wages. He described the situation frustrated passengers faced before platform eight opened - sitting on a static train waiting for a platform to become free. Mr Clarke said: \"If I'm staying in a hotel in the valleys, it is not too bad to Queen Street. But then to central, a three or four minute journey can take 15 to 20 minutes, just sat between the stations. \"It is so frustrating, it is quicker to get off at Queen Street and walk.\" He said the situation is exacerbated if a train is late, with trains then queuing to get on to one of the few available platforms. But with platform eight open, allowing more to arrive at central at the same time, he said he had a \"good experience\" on Tuesday. Jacob Hewlett, 24, has been left frustrated by late trains, but believes the situation will now improve. He said: \"I travel on the Ebbw Valley line and there are always plenty of delays - 20 or 30 minutes into Cardiff. \"It is just really annoying when you have another 10 or 15 minutes on top of that after a hard day's work. An extra line should make my trip to work an awful lot easier.\" Ryan Smith is also confident the work will improve train speeds, but wants to see more work done nearer his home. The line to Treherbert turns to a single track north of Porth, which means only one train can travel on it at a time. He wants to see another put in to speed up the service near the end of the line. For Louis Curtis from Penarth, securing investment to improve the front of the station is just as important as improvements inside. He described the entrance as \"a bit grotty\", adding: \"Before you had the bus station outside, which wasn't that nice. \"Now, it's been knocked down and work is going on, it doesn't give a good impression of the city. \"Hopefully it will be better when everything is done, but there should be more green spaces.\" Natasha Higgitt, 20, uses the line to Cross Keys mid-morning on weekdays and said it is fine at that time, but believes the new platform will improve the situation at rush hour. Meanwhile. on Tuesday protests were held at stations across the UK over a rise in rail fares, including Cardiff Central, Aberdare, Abergavenny and Merthyr Tydfil. An average price increase of 2.3% was introduced on Monday covering regulated fares, including season tickets, and unregulated, such as off-peak tickets. The UK government said it was delivering the biggest rail modernisation programme for more than a century. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales outside Cardiff Central station, Owen Herbert from the RMT union said the rise in fares was an \"absolutely disgrace\" and was not reflected in the services. \"The services have been depleted while fares have been going through the roof,\" he said. He called for the railway system to be nationalised so money taken in fares is \"fully reinvested into the services available to the passenger.\"", "abstract": "Work to upgrade the rail lines in south Wales has been completed over the festive period, Network Rail has said.", "candidate": "Rail services across south Wales have returned to normal following major engineering works.", "doc_id": 2995, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "Network Rail said the lines have now been handed back to rail operators.", "explanation": "The engineer works over ran what they were expended and returned back to the rail operators in South Wales after work.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

{"article": "Built in 1937, the concrete structure was the \"last fragment\" of the derelict seaside lido used for the street artist's \"Bemusement Park\" exhibit last year. Conservationists said they had been told the fountain, in Weston-super-Mare, would be spared from destruction. But North Somerset council said it was demolished due to its poor condition. Visitors to Dismaland were greeted by the sight of the fountain upon entering, and it was picked out by a spotlight at night. Its dilapidated appearance, however, was not the work of the elusive Banksy, but rather a truck which hit the fountain after the site became derelict. The impact caused the upper cascade to tip over, leaving it sitting on its side atop the bottom part of the structure. Weston Civic Society chairman Howard Smith said he felt \"angry and upset\" the fountain had gone. \"They [the council] gave us an assurance at the end of last year that it would be conserved,\" he said.

Princess Anne joined First Minister Nicola Sturgeon for a service at a war graves cemetery in Rosyth. HMS Kent has weighed anchor at South Queensferry before heading to Orkney for further commemorations. Jutland, fought in the North Sea off the coast of Denmark, was the only major naval battle of the 1914-18 war. It brought together the two most powerful naval forces of the time and it became the largest sea battle in naval warfare history in terms of the numbers of battleships engaged. The events on Saturday were designed to mark the \"contribution and sacrifices\" made by those who served during the battle. The commemorations began with a wreath-laying service and then an act of remembrance at Rosyth Parish Church in the town where the battlecruiser force was based in 1916. A minute's silence took place following the ringing of a bell made from the hull of HMS Tiger, a battlecruiser which suffered light damage during the Jutland campaign. Ms Sturgeon said: \"The sacrifices made by those who fought in this battle, the largest naval encounter of the First World War, and by other seafarers throughout the conflict must never be forgotten.\" A service of remembrance was held in South Queensferry Commonwealth War Graves Commission's cemetery, where 40 casualties from the battle are commemorated or buried. Descendents of those involved in the battle, local school pupils and children visiting from Wilhelmshaven in Germany were part of the event. Singer Barbara Dickson, whose uncle was killed in the Battle of the Somme, sang Scottish lament Flowers of the Forest as Princess Anne laid a wreath to remember lives lost. Elizabeth Dickson, whose father survived but her uncle, aged 16, was killed in the battle, said: \"It's very important to commemorate because, always, the tradition of commemoration and the rituals of commemoration are important because they're healing.\" Admiral Lord West, a commander during the Falklands War who went on to be head of the Royal Navy for four years, said: \"We forget sometimes, these sailors didn't die in an instant. There were ones trapped below decks, terrible burns. War is horrible - it was a horrible death on both sides, and we must remember that.\" In the final event of the day, hundreds of people lined the streets around Hawes Pier in South Queensferry. The band of HM Royal Marines (Scotland) performed the Beating Retreat and Ceremonial Sunset, while HMS Kent weighed anchor and fired a gun, before sailing alongside the MV Fingal, a strikingly coloured Dazzle Ship painted by artist Ciara Phillips.

The US says the $10m was a bribe in exchange for Mr Warner supporting South Africa's 2010 World Cup bid. Mr Warner and South African officials have denied any wrong doing. South Africa won the bid ahead of Morocco to become the first African country to host the World Cup. Africa news updates . Mr Warner hails from Trinidad and Tobago and was the president of the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (Concacaf) and vice-president of Fifa when the decision was made. He was among a string of Fifa officials arrested last week after the US and Switzerland launched separate investigations into corruption in Fifa, the world football governing body. In a statement, Fifa said South Africa's government approved a $10m project in 2007 to \"support the African Diaspora in Caribbean countries as part of the World Cup legacy\". The government, in agreement with the South African Football Association (Safa), asked Fifa to \"process the project's funding by withholding\" $10m from the Local Organising Committee (LOC) of the World Cup, the statement added. \"Fifa did not incur any costs as a result of South Africa's request because the funds belonged to the LOC.

Sterling's first-half hat-trick was the first of his career, while Bony, who admitted he contracted malaria in pre-season, doubled his City goals tally since his \u00a328m move from Swansea in January. But Pellegrini said he was pleased with England international Sterling's finishing. \"I am happy because we changed Sterling's position and played him in the middle, with Bony in front of him,\" added Pellegrini. \"We felt it was better for him to be near Bony and also near the box. \"When we bought Raheem in the summer I said we are buying a 20-year-old who is very young and needs to improve. He is not a striker but he can improve his finishing and, today, he did.\" Sterling, whose best scoring record was 11 goals with Liverpool last season, said he had been doing extra work on his finishing. The \u00a344m signing, who has now scored five goals in 11 City appearances, said: \"In training I have been working on one-on-one situations in a few sessions. \"It is something I will keep working on and hopefully I will get better at it.\" Bony also praised Sterling's performance after the Ivory Coast striker scored his first goals of the season. \"We talked a lot in training this week,\" the 26-year-old said. \"I know he is very quick and I told him if I jump you have to run, there is no need to think about if I win the ball or not. \"When we have the ball I look to show myself, it worked today. I am happy about the result and happy he scored three goals.\" City skipper Vincent Kompany remained on the bench against Bournemouth, with Pellegrini saying the defender was not yet ready to return despite playing for Belgium on Tuesday. Belgium manager Marc Wilmots' decision to play Kompany angered Pellegrini after the 29-year-old picked up a calf injury against Juventus on 15 September. But Pellegrini said his omission on Saturday was for fitness reasons only. \"We finished playing with Nicolas Otamendi and Eliaquim Mangala in the last game and they did very well,\" the City manager added. \"He was on the bench because he played for Belgium on Tuesday and couldn't work on Wednesday and Thursday.

{"article": "The decision drops the German to third place, behind team-mate Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull's Max Verstappen and cuts his points lead over Hamilton to one. Mercedes were found to have gone beyond the degree permitted to help a driver solve a technical problem. They broke a rule saying: \"The driver must drive the car alone and unaided.\" Mercedes have lodged an intention to appeal against the decision. The Formula 1 rules were changed this year to introduce restrictions on how much teams can help drivers while they are out on track. Teams are allowed to intervene if the car has a \"critical problem if a failure of a component or system is imminent and potentially terminal\". Race stewards found Mercedes were allowed to give Rosberg instructions on the settings he needed to resolve the problem. But they should not have responded to his subsequent question on whether he should then change gear so the car went straight through seventh gear. Rosberg's engineer Tony Ross replied to the German's information that he had a gearbox problem with the words: \"Driver default 1-0-1, chassis default 0-1, chassis default 0-1. Avoid seventh gear, Nico, avoid seventh gear.\" Rosberg then asked: \"What does that mean, I have to shift through it? Engineer: \"Affirm Nico, you need to shift through it. Affirm, you need to shift through it.\" Both Mercedes F1 team boss Toto Wolff and his opposite number at Red Bull, Christian Horner, questioned the need for the rules restricting driver assistance. Horner said: \"The rule is rubbish. It doesn't make a great deal of sense. But the rules are the rules. \"The cars are technically very complex and you can understand why Mercedes would want to give that message to keep their driver running. \"It's a team sport and the cars are a lot more complicated than they were even four years ago for the drivers to work out what they should and shouldn't be doing. \"The question going forward is are these rules right for F1? That's a different question.\" Wolff, speaking before the decision to penalise Mercedes, drew parallels between this situation and one in last weekend's Austrian Grand Prix, when Force India did not tell their driver Sergio Perez that he had a critical brake problem and the Mexican crashed out on the final lap. Wolff said: \"We see that those rules maybe need a re-think between the FIA and the teams to maybe go more into detail on what is allowed or not because not communicating at all, you might as well unplug the radio and throw it out of the car. It is part of driving since a long time.\" However, the rule is a pet project of FIA president Jean Todt and he has so far been deaf to questions about its suitability.

The NCA becomes fully operational in 2013 when it takes over from the Serious Organised Crime Agency. Its expanded role will include powers to order police forces to run operations into drugs and trafficking. As well as replacing the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca), the new agency will take in the work of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop), and also house the national cyber crime unit. It will also cover border policing and economic crime. \"For too long we have lacked a strong, collaborative national response in the fight for criminal justice. The NCA will make the UK a more hostile environment for serious and organised crime and strengthen our border,\" Mrs May said. She said Mr Bristow would play \"a vital role\" in developing the agency.

{"article": "LeRoy, 68, has replaced Tom Saintfiet, with Togo struggling in 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying and the country's domestic football in a poor state. He said: \"I know it will be difficult; we have only a small chance to qualify for the next Nations Cup and Togo also needs to work on local football. \"But I'm happy, I like this challenge.\" The task appealed to LeRoy to the extent that he ended talks with Tunisia, Algeria and Nigeria over their vacant coaching positions and agreed a three-year contract with Togo after \"only a few hours' negotiation\" - but only after Saintfiet's departure had been confirmed. \"I told them I did not want to discuss the situation before they had an agreement with Saintfiet,\" LeRoy revealed. \"It is always a pity when a coach leaves his job.\" Togo are third in their Nations Cup qualification group with two games to play and only the winners are guaranteed a place at next year's finals in Gabon. LeRoy feels the best Togo can hope for is to take one of the two places given to the best group runners-up - and the Frenchman knows he must convince talismanic striker Emmanuel Adebayor to commit to the cause. \"The key players help the team to get results and win big competitions. I like characters, I like difficult players and I have had a lot of them in my career - starting from Roger Milla (when LeRoy was coach of Cameroon). \"But these players I had were also the first ones at training and the last to leave. They worked hard and were at the disposal of the team. \"Emmanuel has the potential to be one of the top five strikers in the world; he is powerful, fast, technically at the top level and when he is physically at his best it is very difficult to stop him. \"But I want to tell him that nothing is more important then the team, including the coach.\" Adebayor came out of a self-imposed international exile to play in the 0-0 draw with Tunisia in last month's Nations Cup qualifier. It was his first game since June 2015 and the striker, who is currently with English Premier League side Crystal Palace, has long had a difficult relationship with the Togo Football Association as well as nations team coaches, including LeRoy's predecessor Saintfiet. And following his return to the Togo set-up there have been reports that Adebayor is already unhappy again. \"I need to have a big chat with him,\" added LeRoy. \"I like him and I was also very close with him even though I have not been his coach. We have a important Nations Cup qualifier against Liberia in June. \"I don't like the term 'star player' because when you see a star in the sky it is completely dark around it. I prefer a player to be like the sun, shining light on all the people around them. Star players belong in individual sport, not in football. I will try to explain this to him.\" While the immediate task is to try to get Adebayor on side, LeRoy realises that there is much work to be done to ensure a new group of Togolese players will come through to take the place of the 32-year-old and others reaching the end of their career. \"Togo has a lot of good young players but we have to solve some problems,\" said LeRoy, who has coached in Africa for over 30 years and is familiar with the problems at grassroots level on the continent. \"I told the Togo FA we need to work on improving local football in the country. At the moment there is no championship, only the Cup of Independence. \"They need to start a new championship. I have to find local talent and to work with local coaches to prepare the next generation.\" Having led Cameroon to the Nations Cup title in 1988 and only once failed to reached the quarter-finals in his record eight Africa Cup of Nations tournaments, few can argue with LeRoy's record in African football.

{"article": "\"No-one should expect that relations will suddenly deteriorate completely because of this decision,\" Binali Yildirim said. Turkey recalled its envoy to Germany in protest against the resolution passed by German MPs on Thursday. It promised to take \"necessary steps\". Armenians say up to 1.5 million of their people died in the atrocities committed by Ottoman Turks in 1915, during World War One. Turkey says the toll was much lower and rejects the term \"genocide\".

The resolution - adopted overwhelmingly - uses the word \"genocide\" in the headline and text. It also says Germany, at the time an ally of the Ottomans, bears some guilt for doing nothing to stop the killings. The condemnation by Turkish politicians was widespread, including a joint statement by the ruling AK Party and two opposition parties which spoke of \"indignation in the Turkish nation\". However, Mr Yildirim stressed that \"Germany and Turkey are two very important allies\". An estimated three million people of Turkish origin live in Germany. The Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said the resolution would seriously affect relations with Germany, and that the government would consider further measures in response to the vote.

{"article": "The singer-songwriter is one of 85 people from Northern Ireland who have been recognised for their achievements. The Belfast-born musician, whose full name is George Ivan Morrison, will be known as Sir George. He described his new title as a \"huge honour\". Some of the 69-year-old star's biggest hits include Brown Eyed Girl, Moondance and, fittingly, Here Comes the Night. His knighthood has been granted for \"services to the music industry and to tourism in Northern Ireland\". In a statement on Friday, Morrison said: \"Throughout my career I have always preferred to let my music speak for me, and it is a huge honour to now have that body of work recognised in this way. \"I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the fans who have supported me on my musical journey.\" Morrison was born into a working-class family in east Belfast in 1945 but his exceptional talent has made him a global recording star. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as \"one of the greatest singers of all time\". The son of Harland and Wolff shipyard worker, he grew up in a small terraced house in Hyndford Street, in the shadow of the shipyard's famous cranes. His father's extensive record collection exposed the younger Morrison to a huge range of American musicians, including Hank Williams, Ray Charles, and Muddy Waters. Those early influences filtered into Morrison's own eclectic style which mixes soul, blues, jazz and country music with pop and rock. As well as selling millions of records worldwide, he has won six Grammys and a Brit award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. His relationship with stardom and the media has not always been comfortable. In 1993, he became the first living recipient not to attend his own induction ceremony at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. However, more recently he has accepted other accolades in person, including honorary degrees from both of Northern Ireland's universities. Last year, he was granted the freedom of his native city and celebrated the honour by playing a free concert at Belfast's Waterfront Hall. In total, 53 men and 32 women from Northern Ireland have been honoured by the Queen for their achievements in a range of fields and for their contribution to public life. The second highest honour, Companion of the Bath (CB) was given to the top civil servant at Stormont's Department for Social Development, William Haire, while the chief executive of Belfast Harbour Commissioners, Robert Adair, becomes a Commander of the British Empire (CBE). Also honoured is one of Northern Ireland leading exponents of the Chinese lion dance, Yuk Shan Lui. PSNI Assistant chief Constable Will Kerr receives an OBE.

{"article": "MLAs have spent most of Tuesday debating the welfare reform bill, which has reached the consideration stage in Stormont's legislative process. The day's proceedings adjourned at 22:00 GMT but will resume on Wednesday. Welfare reform had caused an impasse until a deal was reached at December's inter-party talks in Stormont House. Politicians agreed to set aside tens of millions of pounds for a fund designed to provide financial support for those adversely impacted by welfare changes. Mr Robinson said the financial cost of not implementing welfare reform would have been at such a level that \"we could not have sustained an executive\". He said that other parties could not have an \"a la carte\" approach to the Stormont House Agreement. \"If people genuinely want to move forward in Northern Ireland, then it is important this legislation goes through. It's important that the parties uphold the agreement that all of us reached,\" he said. At the start of the debate, the DUP was accused of \"killing off discussion\" of the bill. Ulster Unionist Roy Beggs said the DUP had done so by tabling a series of petitions of concern against amendments to the bill. \"They have displayed the undemocratic nature of their attitudes as MLAs and the undemocratic nature of their party, which of course has the word democracy in their name,\" he said. Mr Robinson rejected Mr Beggs' claim that his party's actions were \"shameful\". The measure was designed as a way to safeguard minority rights in Stormont's power-sharing assembly. If a petition of concern is presented to the assembly speaker, any motion or amendment will need cross-community support. In such cases, a vote on proposed legislation will only pass if supported by a weighted majority (60%) of members voting, including at least 40% of each of the nationalist and unionist designations present and voting. Effectively this means that, provided enough MLAs from a particular community agree, that community can exercise a veto over the assembly's decisions. Apart from the amendments tabled by Social Development Minister Mervyn Storey of the DUP, only two others - put forward by the UUP - survived. However, Mr Robinson, the first minister, said assembly members were still capable of discussing the bill as well as the amendments. The SDLP's Alex Attwood accused the DUP of trying to run a \"coach and horses\" through the amendments. \"Never before in the life of the chamber has there been such a swingeing attempt through petitions of concern to shut down what might be good law for the people of this part of the world,\" he said. Sinn F\u00e9in's Martin McGuinness said some SDLP assembly members were defying their party leader Alasdair McDonnell by tabling the amendments in the chamber. \"The SDLP dissidents are clearly now in charge of the party and are prepared to risk the collapse of the Stormont House Agreement - and thereby the power-sharing institutions themselves - for the sake of party political grandstanding,\" he said. Generally, Northern Ireland Assembly bills reach their consideration stage a few months after MLAs first debate their principles. The fact that two years and four months have passed since this bill was last on the floor of the chamber shows just how difficult the arguments over welfare reform have been. However, the essential deal was struck before Christmas, with the parties accepting the introduction of universal credit and personal independence payments, to replace benefits such as jobseeker's allowance, tax credits and disability living allowance. Stormont is providing support for those adversely impacted financially by the changes to the welfare system by setting aside nearly \u00a330m to assist claimants who lose out in 2015/16. Sinn F\u00e9in has claimed the fund will amount to more than \u00a3500m over the next six years.", "abstract": "First Minister Peter Robinson has told MLAs the Northern Ireland Assembly would have \"gone down\" if there had been no agreement on welfare reform.", "candidate": "First Minister Peter Robinson has said the cost of not implementing welfare reform would have led to the collapse of the Northern Ireland Executive.", "doc_id": 3582, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "First Minister Mr. Robinson has said the cost of not implementing welfare reform would have led to the collapse of the Northern Ireland Executive.", "evidence": "Mr Robinson said the financial cost of not implementing welfare reform would have been at such a level that \"we could not have sustained an executive\".", "explanation": "Source text supports facts and assertions in summary except the first name of the first minister who gave the statement about cost of not implementing welfare reform.", "instruction": "Remove the information about first name of the first minister from the summary.

{"article": "The High Administrative Court rejected an appeal by the government against a lower court's decision to stop it handing over Tiran and Sanafir. Cheers erupted as the judge delivered the verdict, saying the government had failed to provide evidence that the islands were originally Saudi. The transfer deal, signed last April, sparked rare protests in Egypt. Tiran and Sanafir are located at the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba. They are uninhabited apart from Egyptian troops and multi-national peacekeepers. President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi said the islands had always belonged to Saudi Arabia and that Riyadh had asked Egypt to station troops there in 1950 to protect them. But Mr Sisi was accused of violating the constitution and \"selling\" the islands in return for a multi-billion dollar aid package announced during a visit to Cairo by King Salman. Saudi Arabia has backed Mr Sisi financially since he led the military's overthrow of his Islamist predecessor, Mohammed Morsi, in 2013. Uproar at the maritime border demarcation accord prompted protests across Egypt at which hundreds people were detained, according to human rights activists. A group of lawyers, including former presidential candidate Khaled Ali, also challenged the agreement at an administrative court. Mr Ali argued that a 1906 maritime treaty between Egypt and the Ottoman Empire stated that the islands were Egyptian. The kingdom of Saudi Arabia was not established until 1932. In June, the court nullified the border accord, ruling that Egyptian sovereignty over the islands held and could not be amended in favour of another state. The government subsequently lodged an appeal with the High Administrative Court. It is part of the State Council, a judicial body that gives legal advice to the government, drafts legislation, and exercises jurisdiction over administrative cases.

Mr Lightman, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said: \"Marking of pupils' work is an integral part of the professional duties of a teacher.\" Dr Allen, speaking at an Education Media Centre event, suggested that even though all political parties backed the idea of cutting workload for teachers, there were few practical measures to achieve this and \"radically different ways\" should be considered. She said schools should consider re-thinking some of the most time-consuming activities, such as marking pupils' work. \"We've got to look elsewhere. We can't just say things like 'paperwork'. I think we need to be realistic and think in radical ways about things like marking,\" said Dr Allen, who is also reader in the economics of education at the UCL Institute of Education. Marking remained popular with parents and was seen as providing evidence for inspections and so teachers were likely to remain under pressure to carry on with large amounts of marking. As such she suggested that there needed to be more imaginative ways of tackling the workload. One approach could be to \"outsource marking\". She said research projects had found accurate marking could be carried out overseas, in countries such as India, for about \u00c2\u00a33 per hour or less. Another approach likely to be explored was using computer technology, she said. There have already been some experiments with outsourcing the marking of vocational qualifications, with candidates' answers being scanned into a computer system in the UK to be checked by staff in India. But heads' leader Mr Lightman said: \"Whilst we would agree that technology can, in appropriate cases be used to process some assessments, I would have serious concerns about outsourcing routine marking. \"Teachers need to see pupils' work themselves so that they can fully understand the degree to which their pupils have understood what has been taught. \"Schools must be resourced adequately to provide them with the time to do this. \"The unnecessary workload surrounding marking has been caused by a high stakes accountability system which places teachers under intense pressure to provide 'evidence' to justify their assessment decisions.\" Kevin Courtney, deputy general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"Teachers don't just look at the rightness or wrongness of the student's answer - they want to understand and support the student's learning process. Outsourcing doesn't help at all with assessment for learning.\" Teachers' unions have frequently complained that excessive workload is one of the major problems for the teaching profession. It has been blamed as a barrier for recruiting teachers and a reason for those leaving the profession. And earlier this year, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg promised that they wanted to find \"decisive measures\" to \"tackle the root causes of unnecessary teacher workload\".", "abstract": "Teachers could reduce their workload by outsourcing the marking of pupils' school work to staff overseas, suggests a leading education researcher.", "candidate": "Schools should consider outsourcing the marking of pupils' work to countries such as India, an education expert says.", "doc_id": 1271, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "One approach could be to \"outsource marking\".

British Airways is not selling new tickets for flights up to 23 November. Flights were halted last week after the UK government said the Sinai plane crash which killed 224 people on 31 October may have been caused by a bomb. Ministers made the decision after experts reviewed the security at Sharm el-Sheikh airport. Some 20,000 British nationals, at least 9,000 of them holidaymakers, were thought to be in the resort at the time. Inbound flights to the UK resumed on Friday and by Monday evening, some 7,473 passengers had been brought back. They are only allowed to travel with hand baggage; hold luggage is to be flown back separately in the next week. Announcing the cancellations up to 25 November, a Monarch spokesman said: \"We recognise this is a very frustrating situation and apologise for the inconvenience this is causing our customers.\" Thomson said: \"All customers booked to travel to Sharm el-Sheikh in this period will be provided with a full refund or can amend to any holiday currently on sale. \"Customers travelling to Sharm el-Sheikh up to and including 10 December 2015 will be able to amend their booking free of charge to any holiday taken by the end of April 2016.\" Easyjet said it hoped to bring all of its customers home by the end of next weekend at the latest. \"Our plan is to bring home as many passengers every day as we can, and to prioritise those who have been delayed the longest,\" it said. \"The reality of this is that many of our passengers will be delayed for up to three days.\" British Airways says it is keeping the situation beyond Thursday \"under review\", but is not taking bookings from new passengers on flights up to and including 23 November.

{"article": "Their evidence, obtained from the cockpit voice recorder and other information outlines in more detail how co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, 28, brought down the Airbus. So how did this final half hour unfold? Germanwings flight 4U 9525 took off from Barcelona Airport in Spain heading for Duesseldorf, Germany, with 150 people on board, at 09:00 GMT on 24 March. The Airbus 320 began travelling over the sea towards France, taking about half an hour to climb to 38,000ft (11,600m). It should have been a two-hour flight and, in the first 20 minutes, the pilots could be heard discussing the stop-over at Barcelona with a flight attendant. At 09:30 the plane made its final contact with air traffic control - a routine message about permission to continue on its route. Everything seemed to be going as planned. Shortly afterwards, the captain told the co-pilot he was leaving the cockpit and asked him to take over radio communications. The cockpit door is heard opening and closing on the recording. Seconds later, shortly before 09:31, the selected altitude was changed from 38,000 ft to 100 ft and the plane began its descent. At 09:33, the plane's speed increased. Air traffic control contacted the co-pilot - and continued to do so over the coming minutes - but received no answer. A buzzer requesting access to the cockpit sounded at 09:34. Knocking and muffled voices asking for the door to be opened can be heard until the end of the recording. At 09:39, \"noises similar to violent blows on the cockpit door were recorded on five occasions\" over the course of a minute. The flight crew of another plane also tried to make contact with the cockpit by radio around this time. In the next minute - 93 seconds before impact - \"low amplitude inputs\" on the co-pilot's flight controls were recorded. But the level of movement was too low to disengage the autopilot, so the input made no change to the flight path. The \"Terrain, Terrain, Pull Up, Pull up\" warning was triggered at 09:40: 41 and it continues until the end of the recording at 09:41:06. French prosecutor Brice Robin gave details of events on board the Airbus when he briefed journalists after the cockpit voice recorder was analysed in the days after the crash. During the first 20 minutes of the flight, he said, the co-pilot's responses were courteous but he became \"curt\" when the captain began the mid-flight briefing on the planned landing. It was shortly after this that the captain left the cockpit, probably to go to the toilet, and within seconds Lubitz had altered the flight monitoring system to send the aircraft into descent. \"This action on the altitude controls can only be deliberate,\" said Mr Robin. In the 10 minutes it took for the plane to plummet through the sky, Lubitz did not say a word and his breathing remained normal - despite repeated attempts by crew members and air traffic control to get him to respond. The Airbus descended at a rate of about 3-4,000ft per minute. The last radar contact was at 09.40:47 GMT at 6,175ft. During the very last moment of the recording passengers can be heard screaming. Mr Robin said he believed they were unaware of what was happening in the cockpit up until this point. The plane hit the mountain at 700km/h (430mph) an hour. \"Death was instant,\" he added.", "abstract": "French accident investigators released their final report into Germanwings Flight 4U 9525, which crashed in the Alps in March 2015, about a year later.", "candidate": "French investigators say the co-pilot of the Germanwings plane that crashed in the French Alps on 24 March locked the pilot out of the cockpit.", "doc_id": 2729, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "French prosecutor Brice Robin gave details of events on board the Airbus when he briefed journalists after the cockpit voice recorder was analysed in the days after the crash.", "explanation": "the original summary's statements are supported by the contextual detail provided in the source text.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

{"article": "BitTorrent Sync uses peer-to-peer technology to send information between users' PCs. It eliminates the need to upload data to a third party's computer servers, as is the case with services such as Dropbox, Google Drive and SkyDrive. But one analyst said businesses were unlikely to be tempted by the idea. Davies Murphy Group's Chris Green said companies would worry about their lack of control over the new process even though it did not rely on a third-party's data centre to update what might be sensitive files. But he said it might appeal to some members of the public for private use. BitTorrent is an eight-year old San Francisco-based company offering a range of free-to-use products designed to make it easy and quick to send large files over the internet. They work by co-ordinating the process so that devices downloading material also share small pieces of already-accessed data with others in order to share the load. Although the technology has become associated with media piracy due to its use by some media-sharing sites, BitTorrent itself is a legal company that makes money by licensing its technology and brands to business customers. It began testing the new tool at the start of the year. The facility is categorised as alpha - signalling it is still being tested and may be unstable - but the firm announced on its blog that it was now ready to invite the public to try it out. It suggested users might find it quicker and more private than the alternatives. \"Since Sync is based on P2P [peer-to-peer technology] and doesn't require a pit-stop in the cloud, you can transfer files at the maximum speed supported by your network,\" it said. \"Your information is never stored on a server in the cloud; your data is protected by encrypted keys. Your files belong to you, and stay on the devices of your choice.\" To prevent unauthorised access to shared data, the software generates a private key for each synched folder on the original device. This is made up of at least 32 characters and must be entered into all the other devices to which the information is sent to in order for the files to be accessible. One of the benefits of synching software is that it allows a user to ensure any changes made to a document on one machine are copied to all their other devices. In its current state, BitTorrent Sync achieves this by noting the change and then copying the whole updated file to other computers, replacing any earlier version. This means it may be less efficient in some cases than some of the cloud-based services that can detect which parts of a file have been changed and only copy over those bits of the data. However, BitTorrent has indicated that it too hopes to introduce \"differential sync\" later this year. The technology has the potential to disrupt the nascent file-synching industry. Although Dropbox, Google, Microsoft, Apple, SugarSync and others offer a limited amount of free storage on their services, they make money by charging customers who need to transfer and synch large files such as video footage or lots of smaller documents. However, Mr Green suggested the earlier cloud-based technique could ultimately prove superior. \"One of the reasons why Dropbox and Google Drive use central servers as middle-men between your devices is that the server plays an important role in ensuring the most recent version of the document gets pushed to each device and doesn't overwrite more recent updates. \"When you are working on a straight device-to-device peer-to-peer method like this it's a lot harder to ensure that safety net. \"However, there's obvious appeal for some people who like the idea of not being beholden or reliant on a third-party who may have technical problems or go bust taking all their data with them.\"", "abstract": "Developers of the BitTorrent file-sharing process have opened an experimental data-synchronising tool up to the public.", "candidate": "The company behind the BitTorrent file-sharing protocol is inviting the public to try out a new version of its software.", "doc_id": 3063, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "The facility is categorised as alpha - signalling it is still being tested and may be unstable - but the firm announced on its blog that it was now ready to invite the public to try it out.", "explanation": "the summary statements about BitTorrent and a new software version are fully supported by the source text.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

{"article": "Average household income rose by 1.4% in 2015-16 after adjusting for inflation, new data from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) shows. Working-age household incomes have been stagnant since 2007-08 compared with a 10% rise for pensioners. Yet, 14% of pensioners households are still on low incomes. The DWP figures also show that in 2015-16, rises in pensioner incomes stalled. A number of reports and previous data have shown that income growth has been faster among pensioners than working-age people since the financial crisis. This has led to widespread debate over the future of the triple-lock - a promise made to pensioners that the state pension will rise in line with prices, wages or 2.5%, whichever is highest. This latest set of figures shows that recently retired pensioners in the UK have seen their incomes rise compared with a decade ago. Average incomes among this group have risen from \u00a3314 in 2005-06 to \u00a3357 in the last financial year. The DWP figures show a regional split, with older people in the South East of England having much higher incomes than those living in Wales and the West Midlands. Steve Webb, a former pensions minister and now director of policy at Royal London, said: \"While there are clearly some pensioners who enjoy good company pensions and have benefited from house price inflation, there are clearly also many who are not in such a fortunate position. \"Any change to policy on state pensions need to take full account of the diversity of experience of pensioners in Britain today, and not simply assume that pensioner living standards will keep on rising.\" For all UK households, the median average income rose by \u00a38 in a year to \u00a3481 a week before housing costs in 2015-16.

Parents claim this would be \"unlawful\" as their children's Educational Health and Care Plan (EHC) states that they should attend Ashton on Mersey. The trust said it was \"oversubscribed\". Parents have contacted a solicitor who has written a formal pre-action letter to the school outlining their legal position. If the school does not respond to the letter by Friday parents will issue judicial review proceedings, James Betts from Simpson Millar Solicitors said. Deborah Keay's 11-year-old son Samuel who has autism has been told he will be one of the pupils with special needs taken by bus to Broadoak, also run by the Dean Trust. She said the change would be very stressful and upsetting for her son. \"I wanted him to go to a mainstream school, but a mainstream school that had quite a number of years of dealing with children on the autism spectrum. \"I know and understand they are a victim of their own success but, at the end of the day, my child's school named on his EHC is Ashton on Mersey.

{"article": "The people have spoken, and delivered a resounding \"not sure\". Unlike last time round, the policies, personalities and Parliamentary arithmetic do not allow for formation of a coalition government. Minority government could be the only answer. Since the end of the Second World War when his late Majesty King George VI asked Clem Attlee to form a government, there have been 18 general elections. Sixteen of these have produced a majority one party government. This tendency for a clear result has us rushing for the constitutional rule book when things are less than clear. In fact, despite Britain's unwritten constitution, the mechanics for forming a minority government are clear and a minority government is not without precedent, especially for voters in Scotland and Wales. Post-war Britain has seen three minority governments. After the inconclusive election of February 1974, Harold Wilson formed a minority Labour government. He had no intention, however, of making this a long term arrangement and in October of the same year, called a second election; where Labour secured a Commons majority of just three seats. The 'indecisive election' of February 1974 led to a minority Labour government under Harold Wilson and another general election in October. Watch: BBC News Timeliner - February 1974 . Watch: BBC News Timeliner - October 1974 . This tiny majority eventually led to Britain's second minority government. A by-election defeat and defections saw Labour lose its majority on the day Jim Callaghan took over as prime minister in April 1976. A short-lived deal with the Liberals came and went and in 1979, the government fell when Margaret Thatcher (supported by the SNP) tabled and won a \"No Confidence\" vote - ushering in 18 years of Conservative rule. This government, towards its end, would see Britain's third minority administration. In 1992 John Major secured a majority of 21 seats, but defections and by-election defeats saw the government enter minority status by November 1996. At Westminster, minority governments don't appear to have worked that well. Wilson tried it for eight months and went for a majority as soon as he could. The tail-end of the Callaghan and Major governments, cannot, even in the most generous of reviews, be regarded as halcyon days of good governance. However, the devolved assemblies in Scotland and Wales have both seen stable, full-term minority governments. Looking at Scotland, the SNP formed a minority government after the 2007 elections to the Scottish Parliament. Being in a minority, it wasn't able to get everything it wanted onto the Statute Book. Bills to enable a referendum on independence and to introduce a local income tax, were axed when it became clear that they had insufficient parliamentary support. Plans for a minimum price per unit of alcohol were also dropped. However, it went the full term, laws were enacted and all its budgets were passed with the support of the Scottish Conservatives. Alex Salmond went on to take majority control in 2011 and the party's continued electoral success could be the talk of this election. Nor are stable and effective minority governments unknown in Commonwealth countries that can trace their parliamentary and governance systems back to \"the Mother of Parliaments\" in Westminster. If we take the ability to pass legislation as one sign of success, then Julia Gillard's minority government from 2010-2013 passed the most Acts per days in office than any other Australian government. More than even than her Labor predecessor Bob Hawke who won comfortable majorities at three elections. In New Zealand, a minority government was elected in 2008, winning re-election in 2011 and 2014. One thing is clear. The politicians must sort it out themselves. The Cabinet Manual, a sort of constitutional handbook, says that \"The Sovereign would not expect to become involved in any negotiations\". Though the Queen's Government must go on, Her Majesty will remain in Windsor, till it becomes clear who she should summon. What is the truth behind the politicians' claims on the campaign trail?

{"article": "The bag rocks alarmingly from side-to-side and threatens to overturn. Now, scientists have investigated this conundrum of everyday physics. Speeding up rather than slowing down can solve the problem, they say. Alternatively, you can pivot the handle of the suitcase as close to the ground as possible. French scientists studied a model suitcase on a treadmill to see what goes wrong when a suitcase rocks out of control at high speed. They developed equations to explain why two-wheeled trolleys have a tendency to rock from one wheel to the other. In cases of unstable bags - after having gone over a bump, for example - they found luggage rocks from side-to-side until it falls over, or it reaches a regular side-to-side swing. If a regular side-to-side swing develops, going faster results in smaller swings, said the researchers. \"Thus, one should accelerate rather than decelerate to attenuate the amplitude of oscillations,\" they explained. \"A non-experienced suitcase puller would not react this way. The outcome should not be a dramatic for a suitcase, but it could be troublesome for a trailer towed by a vehicle.\" This leads on to important practical implications of the research, which is published in the journal HRoyal Society Proceedings A. \"The suitcase is a fun way to tackle the problem but the study would be the same for any trolley with two wheels or blades,\" Sylvain Courrech du Pont, of Universite Paris-Diderot, who led the study, told BBC News. \"So it will be the same for a caravan or maybe also for airplanes.\" In technical terms, the mechanical instability is mainly due to the fact that there is a coupling between the translational motion and the rotational motion of the suitcase. It comes about because the two wheels are fixed together on a rod. In April, scientists solved another problem of everyday physics - why shoe laces come undone. They found the force of a foot striking the ground stretches and then relaxes the knot, while a second force caused by the leg swinging acts on the ends of the laces, like an invisible hand. This too has practical applications for structures such as DNA.

The incident has angered President-elect Donald Trump, who has accused the cast of \"harassing\" his running mate. The President-elect has gone as far as to demand an apology to a \"very good man\", apparently misunderstanding that the cast implored the audience to stop booing Mr Pence. \"Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing. This should not happen!\" Mr Trump tweeted. \"The theater must always be a safe and special place. The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence.

Audience members said the performance was repeatedly stopped because of jeers. However, the message, which was reportedly penned by the show's writers when they learned that Mr Pence planned to attend, was greeted with cheers from the audience at the Richard Rogers Theatre in New York. An audience member tweeted to say there was a three-minute standing ovation when one character performed a song directly to Mr Pence which included the lyrics: \"A small query for you / What comes next? / You've been freed / Do you know how hard it is to lead?\" When Mr Dixon addressed theatregoers at the end, he urged them not to boo and asked Mr Pence, who was leaving, to stay and listen. \"You know, we had a guest in the audience this evening, and Vice-President-elect Pence, I see you are walking out but I hope you will hear us. \"There's nothing to boo here, ladies and gentlemen... We have a message for you, sir, and we hope you will hear us out.\" Mr Dixon continued: \"We truly hope that his show has inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us. \"We truly thank you for sharing this wonderful American story told by a diverse group of men and women of different colours, creeds, and orientations.\" A staunch conservative, Mr Pence sparked an outcry earlier this year after signing a law critics said discriminated against the LGBT community by allowing businesses to refuse service over religious beliefs. He later amended the bill. He is not the first high-profile politician to attend the critically-acclaimed and hugely popular Hamilton, which tells the story of US founding father Alexander Hamilton.

Rangers say the firm breached the contract as the system cannot be used by 50,000 people at the same time. A sheriff will rule on Friday whether an arrestment warrant granted two weeks ago should remain or be lifted. At Glasgow Sheriff Court, lawyers for 802 Works said the firm wanted the money ring-fenced to ensure payment if the club goes into insolvency. The court was told that Rangers \"over a considerable period\", had been operating at a loss of \u00a37.5m per year. Various accounts were lodged at the court, including an audited report dated October 2015, showing financial information and an account showing more recent figures that were taken from the club's account system. The most recent figures were objected to by the representative of 802 Works. Solicitor advocate Simon Catto, representing 802 Works, said the audited report showed a full year's accounts and a loss of around \u00a37.5m per year should be preferred. He said: \"These are the only documents that should be looked at when considering if there is a risk of insolvency.\" Counsel for the club, Christopher Wilson, told the court that the sum sued for is 2% of the turnover. He said: \"The company is turning over that amount each week.\" The court heard Rangers have repaid a \u00a35m loan from Sports Direct. Mr Catto said the defence case, that only 10,000 users could access the Wi-Fi in the stadium and that constituted a breach of contract, was \"feeble\".

{"article": "Produced by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the guidelines recommend women seek advice well before pregnancy on their care. Managing seizure control, tiredness and risks linked to some epilepsy medicines can make pregnancy a difficult time. Epilepsy Action said the guidance would help women make informed decisions. Around 2,500 infants are estimated to be born to women with epilepsy every year in the UK. But there are risks to the health of unborn babies from taking some anti-epileptic drugs during pregnancy, particularly sodium valproate. Some women stop taking their medication or cut down, which can make seizures worse and increase the risk of harm to mother and baby. However, the guidance says \"most mothers have normal healthy babies\", but women with epilepsy should be informed that the risk to the foetus is dependent on the type, number and doses of drug they take. These RCOG guidelines, for GPs, midwives, consultants and women with the condition, say women should: . It's a condition that affects the brain, leading to epileptic seizures. A seizure happens when there is a sudden burst of intense electrical activity in the brain. This causes a temporary disruption to the way the brain normally works. There are many different types of seizure. During the more serious ones, the person can lose awareness, go stiff, fall to the floor and the body can jerk. Some types of epilepsy last for a limited time and the person eventually stops having seizures. But for many people epilepsy is a life-long condition. Shakila Thangaratinam, lead author of the guidelines and professor of maternal and perinatal health at Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, said the right care before, during and after pregnancy was important. \"Women with epilepsy require multi-disciplinary care throughout their pregnancy, and healthcare professionals need to be aware of the small but significant increase in risks. \"While most women who have epilepsy remain free of seizures throughout their pregnancy, some may have more seizures if they are pregnant. \"It is important that these women receive pre-conception counselling, meet with an epilepsy specialist, and are monitored closely for seizure risk factors.\" Simon Wigglesworth, deputy chief executive at Epilepsy Action, said he was delighted to see the guidance published. \"This ensures that they are able to make informed decisions about all aspects of their health and wellbeing, as well as that of their baby.\" Louise Silverton, director for midwifery at the Royal College of Midwives, also welcomed the guidance. \"It is vital we remember that women with epilepsy are classified as high risk during their pregnancy, often they require more monitoring and specialist care during the course of their pregnancy. However, the majority of women with epilepsy will give birth safely.\" Experts say the risk of death is 10 times greater in pregnant women with epilepsy compared with those without the condition.

Thousands of homes have been raided, as the authorities look for people who might be planning protests against President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi. Local and international human rights activists say the situation in the country has never been worse. Mr Sisi led the military's overthrow of Mubarak's Islamist successor, Mohammed Morsi, in 2013 following mass protests. Since then, more than 1,000 people have been killed and 40,000 are believed to have been jailed in a sweeping crackdown on dissent. Most of them have been supporters of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, but secular activists have also been prosecuted for breaking an anti-protest law. There is little trace of the revolution that swept an autocrat from power five years ago, and Egypt's latest strongman is keen to keep it that way, reports the BBC's Orla Guerin in Cairo. Mr Sisi, a retired field marshal who was elected president in 2014, has vowed that there will be a firm response to any unrest on the anniversary. \"The security and stability of nations are not to be toyed with,\" he said in a speech over the weekend at a ceremony marking Police Day, which also falls on Monday.

{"article": "Ms Allred spoke at a press conference alongside three women who said they had been abused by Mr Cosby. Mr Cosby, 77, is facing a series of renewed allegations that he drugged and sexually assaulted over a dozen women. His lawyers describe the claims as \"discredited\" and \"defamatory\". Mr Cosby has had television shows cancelled and some appearances dropped in recent weeks amid the allegations. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, Ms Allred said many of the alleged victims had contacted her to determine what legal rights they had. \"Unfortunately, I had to tell them it was too late for them to file a lawsuit against Bill Cosby because of the statute of limitations - for most women it is simply too late to have their day in court,\" she told reporters. The women's rights lawyer presented two courses of action to, in her words, \"determine whether Bill Cosby is a saint or a sexual predator\". Firstly, she suggested Mr Cosby waive the statute of limitations to allow the alleged victims to present their claims and for him to present his defence. The second option, she said, would be for Mr Cosby to place $100m (\u00c2\u00a364m) in a fund, from which a panel of retired judges would decide what compensation would be appropriate if a woman's claim was found to have merit. Three women then gave accounts of the alleged attacks, with two saying they had been drugged before being assaulted. When asked how many women had contacted her to make a claim, Ms Allred said: \"I literally have lost count.\" The press conference came a day after another woman filed a lawsuit against Mr Cosby over allegations of sexual assault when she was under-age - said to be the first such claim to come to light. Judy Huth says she was 15 when she was molested by the comedian at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles. As she was minor at the time, her case can still be heard. Earlier this week, Bill Cosby resigned from the board of trustees of Temple University in Philadelphia, where he was once a student, amid the allegations. Several broadcasters have also shelved projects with Mr Cosby, including NBC and Netflix. Two of his performances scheduled for the weekend at a venue in the north of New York were cancelled on Wednesday, AP reports.

A funeral mass and burial took place at St Patrick's Church in Clonoe, near Coalisland. She was one of 57 Irish migrants hired to build a stretch of railway in Pennsylvania known as Duffy's Cut. Within six weeks of arriving in Philadelphia, all 57 workers - who hailed from counties Donegal, Tyrone and Londonderry - were dead. It is thought some died from cholera, while others were murdered by local people who believed the immigrants were spreading the disease. Most were buried anonymously in a mass grave near the shanty town where they lived and worked, but Catherine was among several workers buried separately. Officials with the Philadelphia and Columbia railroad never notified the immigrants' families of their deaths. Parish priest Father Benny Fee told the funeral: \"Catherine is one of our own, she's no stranger, she has Tyrone blood in her veins, but we know so little about her. \"What we do know is that she knew suffering. She was married and already widowed at the tender age of 29 - before she was 30 she had loved and lost. We also know she knew poverty, she knew what it was to have nothing in her purse. \"She took the boat to the USA for no other reason than she had no choice - she could stay at home and starve, or she could gamble on taking a boat across the Atlantic and with a bit of luck catch the tail of the American dream. \"But as Christy Moore's song Duffy's Cut says so well, she was sailing into Hell and less than two months into her arrival in the new world, she and her 56 Irish companions in Duffy's Cut were dead and buried in unmarked graves.\" This is the second repatriation of remains found at Duffy's Cut, now a wooded area behind suburban homes in the borough of Malvern, about 20 miles west of Philadelphia.

Police Chief Jim Johnson has said their decision to request a de-activation was based upon the fact Gaines had a gun and a child was present during her standoff with officers.

Outside court, solicitor Mark O'Connor, representing some of the protestors, said: \"My clients are delighted with the resolution to this matter, where they are no longer to face injunction proceedings. \"They don't believe this case should ever have been brought in the first place.\" The Stop the Drill campaign group is objecting to a controversial borehole to search for oil and gas in the area, saying it is part of the catchment for a reservoir supplying water to homes in Belfast and Carrickfergus. They claim chemicals used in the drill process could leach into the water table. But Northern Ireland Water, which leased the site to InfraStrata, insists the project will not compromise the water supply. Groundwater will also be protected by measures, including the drill shaft being encased in steel and concrete, according to the firm. Last week, Mid and East Antrim Council approved a waste management plan - effectively paving the way for four months of work on the site to begin. During a previous hearing, a lawyer for InfraStrata said a protest camp was in operation since March. He claimed groups of up to 25 people gathered during earlier, preliminary stages in the project. At one stage cars were used to block off the entrance to the site, he said. Any further disruption will have financial consequences for a project costing \u00c2\u00a38,000 a day, the court heard. It was argued that the company has a right of way on private land and was only taking the minimal step of seeking an injunction at this stage. A lawyer representing some of the 10 defendants insisted his clients had neither trespassed nor caused obstruction. He also stressed the international concern at what he described as a world-first attempt to drill in a water catchment area.

Speculation had linked Sunderland manager Moyes with the job. \"I don't think there's anybody out there who could do a better job than Gordon Strachan,\" said Moyes, whose side beat Hull City 3-0 on Saturday. The Scot had been under pressure in the first year of his own four-year contract with the English Premier League club. But the win over Hull lifts Sunderland above Swansea City and off the bottom of the table. Moyes has often said that he would like to manage his country at some point but was unhappy to be linked with the role with Strachan still in post. \"Quite rightly so that they kept Gordon on, because he's got a limited group to choose from,\" said the former Everton, Manchester United and Real Sociedad boss. \"I think Scotland did well against England. I think that the score flattered England a little bit. \"And I think Gordon's working with the tools he's got and deserves to be in the position.\" Scotland's 3-0 defeat by the English at Wembley left the Scots six points behind the Group F leaders and four adrift of second-top Slovenia. However, Ross County winger Chris Burke, who has seven Scotland caps, thinks Strachan's side can still finish second and secure a play-off place. \"The way we have to look at it is - are we going to finish first, or did we think we were going to finish first?\" he told BBC Scotland. \"No, we weren't. Realistically, we were looking at coming second and is that still a possibility?

The company's networks sewerage manager, Gavin McCready, warned restaurant owners that fatbergs could have some very unpleasant side-effects. \"These fat blockages can not only result in out-of-sewer flooding, but odour problems and the risk of rat infestations both near and beyond your premises.\" Mr McCready also said it was adding unnecessary costs to the businesses and the public purse. \"While most businesses use grease traps and bin their waste correctly, those that don't are contributing to a massive fatberg in the sewers around the area. \"Our team has been on the site, working over a number of Sunday mornings, clearing the fat that has solidified. \"This is labour intensive work that can only be done early in the morning before the traffic builds up.\" In the last two years NI Water has spent over \u00c2\u00a35m clearing blockages from the sewer system. The company said up to 80% of blockages were caused by fat, oil and grease and other inappropriate items being flushed into drains. The items get stuck together and form a ball, which can build up over time to block sewer pipes. Earlier this month, NI Water spent five hours clearing a fatberg from a drain in Newry, County Down.

{"article": "It was a commitment that in Mr Harper's nearly 10 years as prime minister had seen Canada, long viewed in the region as an honest, if minor, broker in the Arab-Israel conflict, shift emphatically and unequivocally to the Israeli side. While he will undoubtedly remain a friend of Israel, the incoming prime minister Justin Trudeau will also be aiming to repair relations with the Arab world in order to assert his firm belief that a two-state solution requires dialogue with both sides. By contrast, Mr Harper managed to convey the impression that Muslims and Arabs were not to be trusted, most tellingly in his handling of the Syrian refugee crisis. His government's response during the campaign to the drowning death of three-year-old Alan Kurdi, who was attempting with his sister and parents to join family in Canada, highlighted the hard fact that only a tiny number of refugees have been allowed into the country. Early on in the campaign, Mr Trudeau committed Canada to taking 25,000 refugees immediately and he clearly caught the mood of the voters when he said: . \"Canadians get it, that this is about doing the right thing, it is about living up to the values that we cherish in this country.\" And if there was a swing moment in this election, it was probably a debate in the province of Quebec, in French, about the niqab (a face veil). Mr Harper had opposed the wishes of a new Canadian citizen to wear her niqab to the swearing in ceremony, even taking the case to the Supreme Court, where he lost. But he clung to his position that the niqab threatened the fabric of Canadian society. \"Most Canadians believe that it is offensive that someone would hide their identify at the very moment where they are committing to join the Canadian family,\" was how he put it. Mr Trudeau on the other hand argued: \"It's obvious that he's playing very reckless and dangerous games, pitting Canadians against one another for a narrow political goal.\" Mr Trudeau also took the view that Canada should withdraw its fighter jets from the bombing campaign against the so-called Islamic State. But in a deft touch that showed he is no pacifist he promised to commit more troops to training up Iraqi and Kurdish ground forces to fight the jihadists while calling time on Canada's commitment to the aerial war. On Iran, where the Harper government had cold-shouldered the nuclear deal and reaffirmed its support for Israel, Mr Trudeau again took a nuanced position, welcoming a \"significant agreement\" and affirming \"the importance of a diplomatic solution while ensuring Iran cannot build a nuclear weapon.\" On every major Middle East issue Mr Trudeau offered a fresh take. Mr Harper with his unquestioning support for Netanyahu and his deep suspicion of Iran and much of the Arab world brought nothing new to the table. Having staked out his position, he proved incapable of moving from it, a fatal flaw with an electorate hungry for change. Indeed it is no small irony that while in the televised leaders' debates the Middle East received scant attention, on the campaign trail it may well have proven to be Stephen Harper's Achilles heel. Now, with the rout of the Conservatives still fresh, the most pressing issue and the one that Mr Trudeau can act quickly on is the refugee crisis.

{"article": "The Dismaland show - which will also feature work from Damien Hirst, Jenny Holzer and Jimmy Cauty - will take over the Tropicana site for five weeks. \"I loved the Tropicana as a kid, so getting to throw these doors open again is a real honour,\" Banksy said. The show is his first in the UK since 2009's Banksy v Bristol Museum show which drew huge crowds. Banksy described the show as a \"family theme park unsuitable for children\". He said he had been motivated to work on the site which had been \"popular with low income holiday makers\" after peering through a gap in the fence in January. Many of the works require \"audience participation\". \"A dead princess is only complete when surrounded by gawping crowds with their cameras out, or the opportunity to photograph yourself pulling an amazed expression when a killer whale leaps from a toilet,\" he said. \"I guess you'd say it's a theme park whose big theme is 'theme parks should have bigger themes'.\" Dismaland is the official name but it's really Banksyland. Subversive, darkly comic and cocking a snook at authority there are good reasons why the mysterious Mr Banksy is so popular. His stencils are well known but this is something very different - a pitch black antidote to the 'fun day out'. The Julie Burchill 'Punch and Judy', the riot torn village, the 'magic castle' with a paparazzi and Disney centrepiece and, of course, an exit through the gift shop. Fun for all the family? No. Something Britain's seaside has never seen before? Yes. Weston is bracing itself for crowds. Speculation had been growing that the elusive Bristolian was planning an exhibition after a castle and sculpture made from tanker trucks were spotted above the walls. Locals had been told a Hollywood company was filming there. Nigel Ashton, leader of North Somerset Council, said: \"We have been working closely with the organisers for months now and, for obvious reasons, have had to remain tight-lipped about the true nature of the event. \"In fact, only four people in the entire council knew what was really happening.\" The transformation inside the Tropicana is quite stunning. It's still the run-down lido it has been for the past 15 years, but now there's art everywhere. From the moment you walk through the fake airport-style security you get the dismal tone of Dismaland. Grumpy guards play the part astonishingly well. Inside you see Banksy's Cinderella castle and his Grim Reaper dodgem, which dances to the song Staying Alive. But you also get a heavy dose of other local and international artists. Damien Hirst makes contributions alongside others. And the organisers are keen to point to the show's art credentials rather than it being just street art alone. The Tropicana outdoor pool and leisure facility closed in 2000 due to falling visitor numbers. Since then, there has been various attempts to either reopen or demolish the structure. The Trop Trust is trying to reopen the structure and bring it back into use.

The country is home to a range of giant businesses, including pharmaceutical companies Novartis and Roche, the insurance groups Zurich and Swiss Re and the banks UBS and Credit Suisse.

Business leaders said that would limit foreign investment and the government was also opposed to the proposal. The Young Socialists, who proposed the measure, admitted defeat.

There has been widespread public anger at revelations that some of Switzerland's chief executives are earning more than 200 times what their employees take home. Some Swiss have been further irritated that these high levels of pay are being given to executives whose firms have been cutting jobs.

{"article": "Set in a grand retirement home for ageing musicians, Quartet marks the 75-year-old's debut as a film director. The film has its gala screening at the London Film Festival on Monday night. Based on Ronald Harwood's play, Quartet is set in a home for retired musicians, where old rivalries are stirred up by the arrival of former opera singer Jean Horton (Dame Maggie Smith). She is joined in the cast by British heavyweights Tom Courtenay, Billy Connolly, Pauline Collins and Michael Gambon. But Hoffman, who says the the story is about people in their \"third act\", hired a supporting cast of real-life elderly performers to give his film authenticity. \"For these people the phone hadn't rung for 20, 30 or 40 years, even through they can deliver,\" he said on Monday. \"These people in their 70s, 80s and 90s came with such verve every day - and that in itself made this an extraordinarily special occasion for all of us.\" Released in the UK in the new year, the film follows the box office success of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, another ensemble piece about a group of British pensioners in a retirement hotel in India. \"I think a lot of grown-ups would like films for grown-ups and about grown-ups,\" said Dame Maggie, who also starred in Marigold Hotel. \"I don't think films about elderly people have been made very much, but they always seem to be fairly successful.\" The youngest member of the principal cast is Sheridan Smith, who plays the retirement home's medic, Dr Lucy Cogan. The actress said it had been \"overwhelming\" to be part of the film. \"I tried to be like a sponge and take it all in.\" Hoffman's movie breakthrough was as Benjamin Braddock in 1967's The Graduate, for which he was Oscar nominated.

It followed a health warning in 2003 that children should not be given most antidepressants. The unpublished research triggered a Welsh government circular saying other methods should be tried first. The 30% rise came despite a significant fall in 2003-4 following health warnings about the risk of suicide in young people. The report, which has not been published, also showed the drug citalopram was routinely prescribed despite not being licensed for use in children. The Welsh government wrote to health professionals that only fluoxetine (Prozac) has been shown to be effective in young people. A Welsh government spokesman said it expected GPs to use their clinical judgment in deciding treatment, and to use NICE guidelines which recommend psychosocial interventions should be considered as an alternative to antidepressants. The report said the figures could reflect better access to treatment, and a positive shift towards helping people address mental health issues at a younger age.

About 91 Americans die every day after overdosing on opioids. \"I do think it is related to a decline in labour force participation among prime-age workers,\" Ms Yellen said after a question from Senator Joe Donnelly, a Democrat from Indiana. \"I don't know if it's causal or if it's a symptom of long-running economic maladies.\" Ms Yellen also noted that the US has seen an unusual rise in its death rate. \"It's obviously a very serious and heartbreaking problem,\" she said. It was Ms Yellen's second day of testimony before lawmakers, who asked questions about monetary policy, prospects for economic outlook and other issues. Economists have puzzled over the fall in labour force participation rates, the share of people working or looking for work. For the over-16 civilian population, they have declined from a peak of about 67% in the late 1990s to less than 63% today, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Among men, the rates have fallen from about 80% in the late 1960s to less than 70% today. They have risen among women from about 42% to nearly 57% during that time. Ms Yellen on Wednesday said she believed an aging population was a major factor in the overall decline. She also said men with less education have been particularly affected by technological changes that reduce jobs in some industries. Some economists also argue that video games are to blame. Ms Yellen's remarks came on the same day that top US prosecutor Jeff Sessions announced charges against more than 120 people, including doctors, related to prescription drugs. The charges were part of a more sweeping crackdown on Medicaid fraud.", "abstract": "Widespread opioid abuse is tied to a fall in the share of Americans working or looking for work, the head of the US central bank said on Thursday.", "candidate": "The head of the US central bank has blamed a decline in labour force participation for the country's opioid crisis.", "doc_id": 2810, "has_error": false, "intrinsic_error": false, "extrinsic_error": false, "feedback": {"summary": "", "evidence": "\"I do think it is related to a decline in labour force participation among prime-age workers,\" Ms Yellen said after a question from Senator Joe Donnelly, a Democrat from Indiana.", "explanation": "the original summary is correct because its claim about the banker's statements is supported by the source text.", "instruction": "", "instruction_list": []}}

If the six available points from that series are shared, fourth-placed West Indies would finish above India as they have recorded the most wins of the pair. The Windies would also stay fourth if Pakistan, as the home side, are awarded the points because of the Indian board's perceived reluctance to play them.

{"article": "United are reported to have agreed an \u00a318.9m fee for the keeper and Sir Alex Ferguson hopes to wrap up a deal soon. Former United forward Forlan told BBC Sport: \"David will become a top player because he has a lot of ability. \"But he's only just had his first full season as Atletico's number one and is a young guy with little experience.\" Last month, Ferguson said he regarded De Gea as the natural replacement for Edwin van der Sar, who retired after United's Champions League final defeat by Barcelona, and admitted he had been tracking the Spaniard for \"quite a while\". De Gea is currently playing for Spain at the European Under-21 Championships in Denmark, and says he wants to wait until the end of the tournament before signing a deal with United. Forlan, 32, who played for United from 2002 to 2004, has been hugely impressed with De Gea since the Spaniard forced his way into Atletico's team towards the end of the 2009/10 season. \"There's no doubt that David will become a very, very good player, because he has the talent,\" Forlan said. \"He is tall, strong on crosses, a good shot stopper and distributes the ball very well. \"I suppose he is similar to Van der Sar in a lot of ways. Even though he is very young, he gives a lot of confidence to his defenders and has a lot of talent.\" Forlan joined United for \u00a37.5m from Argentine side Independiente, but failed to cement a regular starting place at the club. He famously went 27 games before scoring for his new side and only hit the net 10 times in 63 games before moving to Villarreal. David is from a little town outside Madrid, has been at Atletico since he was very young and doesn't speak any languages other than Spanish . He admitted he does have concerns that De Gea, who came through the youth ranks at Atletico, could become homesick in Manchester. \"You never know for sure whether a player will adapt to a new country until he gets there,\" the Uruguayan said. \"It's true that I was also young when I joined United, just 22, but you can't compare our situations. \"I knew the language and had already left my country, having moved to Independiente when I was only 19. So it was not such a big step for me to go to United. \"David is from a little town outside Madrid and has been at Atletico since he was very young. He doesn't speak any languages other than Spanish. He is going over with his girlfriend and family though, which will help.\" Forlan revealed that De Gea had been hungry for insights into life with the English champions. \"I told him that Manchester United is a great place to experience as a player and that I had a great time there,\" he added. \"The manager and staff are fantastic and the fans were always very supportive of me, even when I wasn't scoring. I made some good friends there and settled in well. Maybe the weather wasn't always what I wanted, but I had a great experience. \"David really wants to go to United, there's no question about that. He wants the challenge and he wants the experience.

{"article": "Goals in either half from Jackson Irvine and Brian Graham earned them all three points. Motherwell's late response began with Stephen Pearson's fierce strike. But Scott Fox saved from James McFadden and brilliantly kept out a Keith Lasley drive to frustrate Motherwell. It was a pulsating finish to a game that only sparked into life when Irvine fired in the opening goal. The Australian was only drafted into the starting line-up minutes before the match because of an injury in the warm-up to Martin Woods. And he made a great case for his inclusion when he deftly controlled a deep corner before lashing the ball past Connor Ripley, despite the best efforts of Kieran Kennedy on the line. Fox saved well from a Louis Moult header and Chris Cadden as Motherwell tried to mount a swift response, but County regained the ascendancy at the start of the second half. Playing principally on the counter-attack, they went close on a number of occasions, with Michael Gardyne having a header cleared off the line and passing up another great chance with a low drive that was blocked. They got the second goal their play deserved when Graham slotted past Ripley as the Motherwell defence failed to deal with a Stewart Murdoch cross. That looked like game over until Pearson's late strike - the midfielder blasting past Fox from 12 yards. But the keeper was sharply off his line to prevent McFadden's lob beating him and he sprung to his right to deny Lasley a spectacular equaliser.

{"article": "French media reported that a five-year deal had been agreed to host the race at Le Castellet, near Marseille. Ecclestone told Reuters: \"Yes, I think it will happen,\" adding that it would be held in late July, not a month later as the initial reports had suggested. France hosted the first ever grand prix in 1906 but lost its slot in 2008. There have been several attempts since to revive the race but this one looks to be the first to succeed. A news conference has been organised for an announcement about the future of the French Grand Prix in Paris on Monday, to be hosted by Christian Estrosi, the president of the Regional Council of Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur. The French sports newspaper L'Equipe reported that a five-year deal had been agreed with the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region in association with the city of Toulon, department of Var and the French motorsport association. Le Castellet - also known as the Circuit Paul Ricard - last hosted the French Grand Prix in 1990. From 1991-2008 it was held at Magny-Cours in central France. Ecclestone's family trust owns the track but the 86-year-old said: \"It's nothing to do with them at all. I think they are renting it to the people that are going to be the promoters.\" He said the race would be held on \"more or less sort of the German date probably\", without specifying what that meant for the future of the German Grand Prix. That race has dropped off the calendar for next year because the Nurburgring, one of two venues that alternate as hosts, cannot meet its financial obligations under its contract with F1. But Hockenheim, which held the race in 2016, has a contract to do so again in 2018. The return of France will be greeted with widespread delight by both F1 insiders and fans of the sport. This is because of its historic significance and because it is another race in the sport's heartland of Europe rather than, as has been the recent trend for new events, in a country where the sport has limited support and no heritage. F1 is in the process of being bought by US group Liberty Media, and it has said that protecting races in F1's heartland is a major priority, along with expanding its presence in the US, the rest of the Americas and Asia.", "abstract": "The French Grand Prix will return to the Formula 1 calendar after an absence of 10 years, the sport's boss Bernie Ecclestone has said.", "candidate": "The French Grand Prix will return to the Formula 1 calendar in 2018, says F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone.", "doc_id": 3675, "has_error": true, "intrinsic_error": true, "extrinsic_error": true, "feedback": {"summary": "The French Grand Prix will return to the Formula 1 calendar in 2019, says Ecclestone.", "evidence": "But Hockenheim, which held the race in 2016, has a contract to do so again in 2018.", "explanation": "The summary states the French Grand Prix will return in 2018 but the source text indicates it will be the following year.
